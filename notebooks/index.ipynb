transcription factor immunoglobulin domain, ankyrin repeats, and calmodulin-binding IQ motifs. The encoded protein is thought to be a transcription factor and may be a tumor suppressor. However, a translocation event is sometimes observed between this gene and the WWTR1 gene, with the resulting WWTR1-CAMTA1 oncoprotein leading to epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, a malignant vascular cancer.

In yeast, vacuolar-protein-sorting-13 proteins are involved in trafficking of membrane proteins between the trans-Golgi network and the prevacuolar compartment. While several transcript variants may exist for this gene, the full-length natures of only two have been described to date. These two represent the major variants of this gene and encode distinct isoforms.
