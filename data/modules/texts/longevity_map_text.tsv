The study had the following design: C282Y, H63D and S65C polymorphisms were studied in 106 young controls (age range from 22 to 55 years; 40 men and 66 women) and 35 elderly subjects (age range from 91 to 105 years; seven men and 28 women). The study concluded the following. A significant difference was observed only in women in frequencies of C282Y alleles between the young and the elderly subjects. Concerning H63D polymorphisms, no significant differences were observed, between old and young people.The study was published with pubmed id 11857058 with DOI http://doi.org/10.1038/sj.gene.6363827

The study had the following design: The -670 and -1377 position SNPs were examined in 50 centenarians and 86 young controls. The study concluded the following. Genotype and allele distribution for both polymorphisms were similar in controls and centenariansThe study was published with pubmed id 11965496 with DOI http://doi.org/10.1038/sj.cdd.4400964
