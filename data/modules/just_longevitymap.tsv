282	20q13.12	Functional SNPs have been determined for 1071 unrelated healthy individuals (502 males and 569 females) from Central Italy, 18-106 years old, divided into three gender-specific age classes defined according to demographic information and accounting for the different survivals between sexes. The categories for men were: individuals <66 years old, individuals 66-88 years old, and individuals > 88 years old. The categories for women were: individuals <73 years old, individuals 73-91 years old, and individuals > 91 years old.	Single-locus analysis showed that when comparing all 3 age categories only ADA 22G>A (rs73598374) is significantly associated with human life-expectancy in males 	significant	male/female	Napolioni et al.

286	1p13.2	A functional polymorphism in PTPN22 (R620W) was tested for survival to old age and reaching exceptional longevity.  For this purpose 892 unrelated healthy individuals (8-106 years, males and females) from central Italy were studied.	The frequency of PTPN22 1858C>T polymorphism did not differ significantly in nona/centenarians and octogenarians compared to young individuals. Further allele and genotype frequencies comparison of age groups of previously studies on 1393 control individuals with Italic ancestry confirmed this observation. Thus, this allele is not negatively selected at oldest ages.	non-significant	male/female	Napolioni et al. (2011)	2011	21113673	PTPN22	26191	54	10.1007/s11033-010-0546-8

In the Japanese cohort, C allele did not differ between centenarians and healthy controls, but it was significantly lower in centenarians than in CAD controls.	significant	male/female	Pinós et al.

1215	5q32	A 10-year follow-up study of the Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey was performed consisting of 963 long-lived and 1028 geography-matched young individuals. Sixteen SNPs from ADRB1, ADRB2, ADCY5, ADCY6, and MAPK1 were selected and genotyped. 	Two SNPs, rs1042718 (C/A) and rs1042719 (G/C), of ADRB2 in linkage disequilibrium were found to be associated with enhanced longevity in men in two geographically isolated populations. Men with haplotype A-C showed an increased probability to become centenarians , in contrast to those with haplotype C-G.	significant	male/female	Zhao et al.

Carriers of the A allele at rs11235972 and carriers of the G allele at rs3781907 showed a reduced survival chance.

1336	11q13.4	Two cohorts of middle aged (N = 708; 356 males and 352 females) and oldest old individuals (N = 908; 265 males and 643 females) were genotyped for UCP3 polymorphisms, hand grip performance and survival at old age	The study showed that after 10 years from the start of the project, a significant effect on survival chances was observed for rs11235972 and rs3781907. Carriers of the A allele at rs11235972 and carriers of the G allele at rs3781907 showed a reduced survival chance. Interestingly, the rs11235972-A variation was also associated with a decreased in hand grip performance in this cohort.

2126	1q24.3	The baseline levels of sCD14 (soluble form of CD14) were measured in 5888 European-American and black adults aged 65 years and older from the Cardiovascular Health Study. A genome-wide cardiovascular disease candidate gene-centric association with sCD14 was conducted separately in the European-Americans (n=2952) and blacks (n=528). Finally, the ability of sCD14 and its main genetic determinants to predict incident CVD and mortality during follow-up was assessed.	sCD14 was positively correlated with cardio-metabolic risk factors and with subclinical measures of vascular disease, and was also inversely correlated with body mass index (all P<0.001). In European Americans the minor allele at the index SNP rs5744441 was associated with lower sCD14, the C allele of index SNP rs1063412 was associated with lower sCD14. In Blacks the index SNP rs778584 was associated with higher sCD14. In the fully adjusted model, sCD14 was associated with death because of cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio=1.13, P=0.001) and death because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio=1.11, P=0.001). CD14 independently predicts risk mortality in older adults.

NDUFS1, TXNRD1, SOD2 and UCP3 were found significantly associated with lifespan in the female cohort.

Haplotype analysis was performed in three candidate genes, and the haplotype combinations were tested for association with exceptional longevity.

3471	1p36.22	The distribution of CETP*V and APOE*4 were analyzed in 372 oldest-old women (aged 80-109) and 340 controls (aged 20-58).	APOE E4 was less frequent in the oldest-old group.	significant	male/female	Sun et al. (2014)	2014	24746514	E4	10277	22	10.1016/j.exger.2014.04.003
3472	5q32	Common polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene were studied for association with survival and longevity in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort for which data was available for 1565 subjects	The Gln27Glu and Glu27Glu genotypes and the Glu27 allele were associated with shorter lifespans at young-old ages (cut-off = 72 years) and longer lives in oldest-old ages (e.g., cut-off = 83 years) compared to carriers of the Gln27Gln genotype. The Gln(27)Gln genotype was also associated with age-related diseases, such as cancer.	significant	male/female	Kulminski et al. (2010)	2010	20399803	rs1042714	154	15	10.1016/j.mad.2010.04.001
3473	17p13.1	A genome-wide linkage scan on human longevity was performed in 279 families with multiple long-lived siblings	One locus on chromosome 9q31-34 was borderline significant and a peak on 12q24 was detected in a subset of the data. There was also modest evidence for a peak on 4q22-25.	non-significant	male/female	Boyden and Kunkel (2010)	2010	20824210		7157	15	10.1371/journal.pone.0012432
