Unique Lipoprotein Phenotype and Genotype Associated With Exceptional Longevity

Context Individuals with exceptional longevity have a lower incidence and/or significant delay in the onset of age-related disease, and their family members may inherit biological factors that modulate aging processes and disease suscep-

Design, Setting, and Participants In a case-control design, 213 Ashkenazi Jew- ish probands with exceptional longevity (mean [SD] age, 98.2 [5.3] years) and their offspring (n=216; mean [SD] age, 68.3 [6.7] years) were recruited from 1998 to 2002, while an age-matched control group of Ashkenazi Jews (n=258) and participants from the Framingham Offspring Study (n=589) were accepted as control groups.

Main Outcome Measures Detailed questionnaires, physical examination, and blood samples were taken, including assessment of lipids and lipoprotein subclass levels and particle sizes by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Samples were also genotyped for the codon 405 isoleucine to valine (I405V) variation in the cholesteryl ester trans- fer protein (CETP) gene, which is involved in regulation of lipoprotein and its particle

gevity have been generally spared from major age-related diseases that are responsible for most deaths in elderly persons, such as cardiovascu- lar disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer disease, and cancer.1 Vari- ous studies suggest that genetic deter- minants of exceptional longevity are highly heritable.2,3 Siblings of cente- narians have an 8- to 17-fold higher probability of living past the age of 100 years, accounting for only approxi- mately 1 of 10000 individuals in the general population.2,3 The offspring of long-lived parents have an approxi- mately 50% lower prevalence of hyper- tension, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and stroke/transient ische- mic attacks compared with age- matched control groups.3 Further- more, at least 1 study linked a locus on chromosome 4 to exceptional longev- ity.4 Identification of biological mark- ers and genes that are conducive to exceptional longevity may provide in- sights into mechanisms that protect from a host of common diseases and/or slow the biological processes of aging.

Results High-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle sizes were significantly higher in probands compared with both control groups (P=.001 for both), independent of plasma levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 and B. This phenotype was also typical of the proband’s offspring but not of the age-matched controls. The HDL and LDL particle sizes were signifi- cantly larger in offspring and controls without hypertension or cardiovascular disease, (P=.001 and P=.008, respectively). Furthermore, lipoprotein particle sizes, but not plasma LDL levels, were significantly higher in offspring and controls without the   metabolic syndrome (P .001). Probands and offspring had a 2.9- and 3.6-fold (in men) and 2.7- and 1.5-fold (in women) increased frequency, respectively, of homo- zygosity for the 405 valine allele of CETP (VV genotype), respectively, compared with an MeP<. controls (P .001 for both). Those probands with the VV genotype had increased lipoprotein sizes and lower serum CETP concentrations.

Conclusions Individuals with exceptional longevity and their offspring have sig- nificantly larger HDL and LDL particle sizes. This phenotype is associated with a lower prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, and increased homozygosity for the I405V variant in CETP. These findings suggest that lipoprotein particle sizes are heritable and promote a healthy aging phenotype. JAMA. 2003;290:2030-2040 www.jama.com

ing-related diseases may be more rel- evant to humans. Expression of hu- man cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in rats, a species that com- monly lacks this gene, leads to com- bined hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, and decreased survival, mak- ing CETP a strong candidate gene for human aging.5 Cholesteryl ester trans- fer protein is involved in the regula- tion of reverse cholesterol transport and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) lev- els. Indeed high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and low levels of HDL cholesterol are corre- lated with increased incidence of CVD in humans, although other factors may contribute to accelerated aging through effects on vascular wall, cancer, or other mechanisms.1 Although lipoprotein lev- els are not consistently unusual in cen- tenarians, this does not rule out its po- tential role in promoting longevity, because the levels may be different at the end of life in centenarians than they were at earlier ages.

genetic homogeneity and has made this population useful for identification of several genes, the breast cancer gene being a prominent example.8 Two hun- dred thirteen probands with excep- tional longevity (157 women and 56 men; mean [SD] age, 98.2 [5.3] years; | yve range, 95-107 years; 48% were 100 years)wererecruitedtoparticipateinthe study, which was conducted from 1998 to 2002. The participants’ ages were de- finedbybirthcertificatesordatesofbirth as stated on passports. Probands were required to be living independently at 95-years-old as a reflection of good health, although at the time of recruit- ment they could be at any institution or level of dependency. In addition, pro- bands had to have a first-degree off- spring who was willing to participate in the study. The offspring group con- sisted of 122 women and 94 men (mean [SD] age, 68.3 [6.7] years; range, 51-89 years). We used 2 different control groups. The first control group con- sisted of spouses of the offspring (n=75; mean [SD] age, 70.2 [10.2] years; 53% women). Fewer spouses of offspring than offspring of probands were re- cruited because 22 spouses had died, 18 offspring were divorced or sepa- rated, 10 spouses were not Ashkenazi Jews, and 55 spouses elected not to par- ticipate. The first control group also consisted of 183 age-matched Ash- kenazi Jewish controls recruited from the Einstein Aging Study9 (mean [SD] age, 71.3 [9.1] years; 57% women) for a total of 258 participants. Of this first control group, 2 participants were ex- cluded from the analysis because their parents had lived to be 98 and 102 years. A second control group con- sisted of 589 age-matched white par- ticipants enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study (mean [SD] age, 67.8 [3.5] years; 48% women), a commu- nity-based cohort. Given the low preva- lence of exceptional longevity in the general population, we reasoned that the Framingham controls are not likely to have a family history of exceptional longevity or to carry longevity genes or phenotypes.

Clinical Evaluation

A research nurse visited the probands in the morning to draw a venous blood sample, obtain a medical history, mea- sure height and weight, and perform a physical examination. Health histo- ries were obtained using a standard- ized questionnaire. At that visit, the off- spring and the participating spouses underwent similar evaluations, as pre- viously described.3,6,7 All blood samples were processed at the General Clinical Research Center at Albert Einstein Col- lege of Medicine.

We followed the National Choles- terol Education Program (Adult Treat- ment Panel III) guidelines,10 defining the metabolic syndrome as the pres- ence of 3 or more of the 5 risk factors: ahs(>¢ increased waist girth ( 94 cm for women, 102 cm for men), increased in(>1 blood pressure ( 130/85 mm Hg or treatment for hypertension), in- ne(1 creased fasting glucose ( 110 mg/dL Vite[>6 [ 6.11 mmol/L] or drug treatment for diabetes), low plasma HDL choles- AROS(<4 [<l terol ( 40 mg/dL [ 1.04 mmol/L]), and elevated fasting triglycericde lev- ed(1 Oo *[1 els ( 150 mg/dL [ 1.70 mmol/L]).

We developed a novel study design in a genetically homogeneous founder population to identify the biological and genetic underpinnings of exceptional longevity by studying Ashkenazi Jew- ish families defined by long-lived pro- bands. In addition, we recruited the offspring of probands and an age- matched control group, hypothesiz- ing that the former may have inher- ited certain biological protective factors that could be more easily discerned at younger ages if compared with an age- matched control group.

Lipids and Lipoproteins

Total plasma cholesterol, triglycer- ides, HDL, LDL, very LDL, and apoli- poprotein A-I and B concentrations for Ashkenazi participants were per- formed by standard automated meth- ods at the clinical laboratories of Mon- tefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. The same lipid measurements were per- formed on fasting plasma samples from the Framingham Offspring Study as previously described.11 The LDL and HDL subclass levels and mean particle sizes were determined for all partici- pants by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at LipoScience Inc (Raleigh, NC) as previously de- scribed.12,13 Each NMR measurement produces the concentrations of 3 LDL

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

In a case-control study, Ashkenazi Jews were recruited as described else- where.3,6,7 This population derived from an undetermined small number (esti- mated to be in the several thousands) of founders. External factors, including ecclesiastical edicts prohibiting all so- cial contact with Jews, the Crusades, the establishment of the Pale of Settle- ment, numerous Pogroms, and ethnic bigotry, resulted in the social isolation and inbreeding of the Ashkenazi Jews.

subclasses and 5 HDL subclasses of varying size. From the LDL and HDL subclass levels are calculated weighted- mean LDL and HDL particle sizes (nm diameter) and LDL particle concentra- tions (nmol/L). Lipoprotein sub- classes were grouped as large LDL (21.3-23.0 nm), intermediate LDL (19.8-21.2 nm), small LDL (18.3-19.7 nm), large HDL (8.8-13.0 nm), inter- mediate HDL (8.2-8.8 nm), and small HDL (7.3-8.2 nm). Although the LDL sizes ranged from 18.3 to 23.0 nm and HDL sizes from 7.3 to 13.0 nm, small changes within this range are associ- ated with marked clinical differences in CVD risks.

P .05 was considered the threshold for statistical significance. Data are expressed as mean (SD or SE).

Probe specificities had previously been confirmed by sequenc- ing and through use of DNA genotyped independently through other methods such as restriction length polymor- phism analysis.16 The CETP concentra- tions in human serum were measured by ELISA (Wako Chemicals USA Inc, Richmond, Va).

Lipoprotein Properties in Families With Exceptional Longevity

Statistical Analyses

Because the extreme old age of the pro- bands preempts a proper comparison (control) group, we also recruited the offspring of probands, some of whom presumably inherited longevity genes and thus should manifest the longev- ity phenotype. Candidate longevity phenotypes could then be compared between the offspring and age- matched Ashkenazi controls or non- Ashkenazi participants of the Framing- ham Offspring Study, neither of which are known to have longevity genes. There were no significant differences between the groups for routine blood chemistries,includingelectrolytes,liver function, and kidney function tests. Body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) was similar between offspring and the Ashkenazi control groups (P=.75 and P=.21 in women and men, respectively), both of which were significantly higher than in probands (TABLE 1). Typical mea- sures of lipoproteins, including total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycer- ideswerequitesimilarinprobandscom- pared with control group as well as between offspring and control groups. Only total cholesterol and LDL levels were lower in female probands vs con- trol groups, and HDL levels were sig- nificantly higher in female offspring compared with Ashkenazi control groups. In contrast, there were marked differences between groups in lipopro- tein particle sizes as determined by NMR. The HDL and LDL particle sizes inprobandsweremarkedlyhighercom- paredwithbothcontrolgroups(P=.001

Pairwise crude comparisons of lipid lev- els and lipid particle sizes among the study groups were performed by us- ing the Mann-Whitney U test because the distributions were skewed. Be- cause of strong correlations among the lipid variables, a multivariate analysis was also needed to disentangle the re- lationships between the different lipid variables and study group member- ship. We conceptualized the study groups as forming an ordered set, with probands containing the highest preva- lence, offspring an intermediate preva- lence, and controls the lowest preva- lence of longevity-promoting genes and phenotypes. Therefore, we used or- dered logistic regression to determine which lipid variables exhibited the strongest ordinal association with study group membership. Study group mem- bership (1 = control, 2 = offspring, 3=proband) was the dependent vari- able, and LDL, HDL, LDL-particle size, and HDL-particle size were the inde- pendent variables. In interpreting the results of this analysis, direct compari- son of the coefficients of the indepen- dent variables is not meaningful be- cause they are measured in different units. The corresponding z statistics are all dimensionless and directly com- mensurable, and were used as mea- sures of the ordinal association be- tween the lipid variables and study group membership. Calculations were performed by using SAS version 6.12 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata ver- sion 8.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex). Narrow sense heritability (h2) was

The LDL and HDL subclass distribu- tions and particle sizes determined by NMR are highly correlated with those measured by gradient gel electropho- resis and density gradient ultracentri- fugation.14,15 The analytical reproduc- ibility (given by the coefficient of variability) of LDL and HDL size is less than 0.5%,12 and the stability on re- peated drawing for LDL size was 0.9% and for HDL size was 1.1%.

CETP Genotyping and

Lipoprotein sizes are largely deter- mined by hepatic lipase and CETP, in addition to other possible pathways, therefore providing the rationale to examine variation in these genes. We sequenced the promoter region of hepatic lipase gene in 100 centenarians comparedwithcontrolsanddidnotfind different frequencies in known and unknown polymorphic markers in this region. We then genotyped several known CETP polymorphic markers: –631C/A(NCBIdbSNPrs1800776)and –629C/A (rs1800775) in the promoter; codon 405 isoleucine to valine (I405V) (rs5882) and D442G (rs2303790) in exons 14 and15, respectively; and G/A Amultilocuspolymerasechainreaction– based assay in the first nucleotide in intron 14 was used to genotype these polymorphisms.16 Briefly, DNA was amplifiedusingamultiplexreactioncon- tainingbiotinylatedprimerpairs.Ampli- fied fragments within each polymerase

ingly different distribution of LDL par- ticle size in offspring of probands compared with control groups. These distributions suggest that only a sub- set of offspring carry the high HDL trait, which may have been inherited in these individuals. Additionally, this distri- bution could represent a survival effect. Trends for men were similar, al- though mean HDL and LDL particles size were lower than in women (data not shown).

As in their parents, off- spring of exceptional longevity pro- bands had significantly larger sizes of their LDL and HDL particles com- pared with their age-matched controls AinP<. (P .001 for both), although the dif- ference in HDL particle size was not as high in men.

Examining the relationship tween lipoprotein particle sizes and in our sample, we found that both and HDL particle sizes are larger for spring of probands than in the group across all ages (FIGURE 3). The same relationship apparent when men and women considered separately. Lipoprotein ticle sizes were relatively constant til 80 to 85 years, after which sizes increased dramatically. This gests more survival to older ages in

The plasma HDL frequency distri- bution was approximately normal in women (FIGURE 1) and men. How- ever, offspring of probands had a skewed distribution in which 46% of the female offspring and 42% of male offspring had plasma HDL levels that were 1 SD above the mean. Similarly, we found a bimodal frequency distri- bution of HDL particle size with strik-

Direct comparison of the regres- sion coefficients is not meaningful be- cause the independent variables are measured in different units.

Because lipoprotein concentrations and size are important CVD risk factors, we next examined the relationship be- tween lipoprotein particle size, hyper- tension, and the prevalence of CVD, de- fined as having a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ische- mic attack in the combined group of our Ashkenazi offspring and control (TABLE 2). The Framingham Off- spring Study and Einstein Aging Study were not included in this analysis be- cause clinical evaluation for these CVD traits was performed differently. Sig- nificantly higher percentage of large HDL particles, HDL particle size, per- centage of large LDL, and LDL par- ticle size where observed in healthy participants compared with those with hypertension. Moreover, significantly higher percentage of large HDL par- ticles, HDL particle size, percentage of large LDL, and LDL particle size were observed in healthy participants com- pared with those with CVD. Unexpect- edly, LDL levels were lower in the hy- pertension and CVD groups, probably accounted for by use of cholesterol- lowering drugs (18% in the healthy group, 38% in the hypertension group, and 60% in the CVD group). Signifi- cantly lower levels of HDL in hyper- tension and CVD groups were ob- served compared with the healthy group, but neither very LDL nor tri- glyceride levels were significantly dif- ferent between hypertension risk groups. In total, these findings sug- gest a possible link between the size of lipoprotein particles and age-related hy- pertension and CVD.

Neither allele or genotype frequencies of the –629 C/A variant differed signifi- cantly among probands, offspring, or Ashkenazi control groups, nor was this variant associated with lipoprotein lev- els or particle sizes.

Strikingly, the frequency of homozygosity for the codon 405 va- line allele of CETP (VV genotype) was 24.8% in female and male probands compared with only 8.6% in Ash- kenazi control groups. These differ- ences were statistically significant in P<. both men and women (P .001 for both) (FIGURE 4).

44%, similar to a frequency of 39% in the much younger control group. Off- spring had a significantly lower fre- quencyofthemetabolicsyndrome(26%, P=.03vscontrol),althoughthesegroups were well matched for BMI and age. We further tested whether the participants without the metabolic syndrome have also larger lipoprotein sizes (Table 2). Indeed, larger HDL and LDL particle sizes were apparent when age-matched participants with and without the meta- bolic syndrome were compared. This effect was not noted for LDL levels, be- cause of the widespread use of statin therapy. Because reduced HDL level is one of the criteria for having the meta- bolic syndrome and is associated with HDLparticlesize,werepeatedtheanaly- sis with participants whose metabolic syndrome was redefined by 3 criteria other than plasma HDL levels. Lipopro- tein particle sizes were still signifi-

cantly larger in those without the meta- bolic syndrome. These findings suggest a lower frequency of metabolic syn- drome–related traits in participants ge- netically predisposed to longevity.

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein has been shown to modulate HDL and LDL levels and sizes.19-22 To determine if ge- netic variation in CETP might influ- ence lipoprotein particle size or lon- gevity, we analyzed several common single nucleotide polymorphisms of CETP. All of the single nucleotide poly- morphisms examined were in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium in probands, their offspring, and the Ashkenazi con- trol groups (Framingham Offspring Study samples were not genotyped). The allele frequencies of –629 C/A and

eases, including CVD, dementia, infec- tions, and cancer. The longevity phenotype is likely to be one that in- volves diverse biological processes and protects from a number of age-related diseases, and these processes may be different than suggested from studies of other species.23 This study demon- strates to our knowledge the first time that families with exceptional longev- ity have markedly larger particle sizes of HDL and LDL, which are largely in- dependent of the absolute levels of li- poproteins and apolipoproteins. This particular phenotype is associated with a lower prevalence of hypertension and CVD and the metabolic syndrome in

tween probands and control groups and also significantly higher than in con- trol groups (P=.004).

In principle, one cannot calculate the attributable risk of VV genotype for lon- gevity from a case-control study be- cause it is derived from incidence rates. However, a reasonable approximation can be calculated by using the estima- tion formula:

Does lipoprotein particle size play a direct biological role in successful ag- ing and the longevity phenotype, or are these measures simply markers of the longevity phenotype? Although our

where P is the prevalence of VV homo- zygosity in the population and OR is the odds ratio associating VV homozygos- ity with longevity. This estimation for- mula is valid so long as the outcome (longevity) is rare in the population (ap- proximately 1 of 5000-10000). In our data, the OR (combining men and women) is 3.56. We do not have a di- rect observation of population preva- lence of VV homozygosity in our data. However, it is reasonable to take the control groups as a proxy for the popu- lation as a whole because the number of people who will ultimately survive to longevity is a very small proportion of the population. Our estimate of the prevalence of VV homozygosity is 0.09, and applying the formula, population attributable risk fraction is 18.1.

We also assessed the relationship be- tween CETP I405V genotype and lipo- protein particle sizes and CETP activ- ityinthecontrol,offspring,andproband groups, respectively. The VV pheno- type was associated with significantly larger LDL and HDL particle sizes (TABLE 3). Furthermore, participants with the VV genotype had 17% lower CETP concentrations compared with those with II or IV genotype, and HDL level and CETP levels were negatively correlated (r=–0.29; P=.03; Spearman p) ). These findings suggest a survival ad- vantage for individuals with the VV genotype,perhapsmediatedthroughde- creased levels of CETP and its effects on lipoproteins and their particle sizes.

Because it has been shown that lipo- protein sizes are genetically deter- mined,33 we were interested in finding potential pathways involved in this phe- notype. The biology of rare forms of CETP deficiency may be relevant to our observation of a marked increase in the frequency of homozygosity for the com- moncodon405valineCETPalleleinour families with longevity. Although ho- mozygosity for this variant was ob- served in 24.8% of our probands, it was present at a frequency of only 8.6% in Ashkenazi Jewish control participants. Offspring of long-lived individuals also had a much higher frequency of the VV genotypecomparedwithcontrolgroups. With analyses of 30 different single nucleotide polymorphisms, it could be arguedthatourpositivefindingforI405V CETP is the result of multiple compari- sons.However,thelevelofstatisticalsig- P<. nificance of this association (P .001) maintainsstatisticalsignificanceevenaf- terrigorouscorrectionformultiplecom- parisons. Furthermore, investigation of this variant was hypothesis driven based on known pathways of lipoprotein me- tabolism. Correction for multiple com- parisons would be considered by many as overly conservative. To our knowl- edge,thereisnootherexampleofapoly- morphic allele whose frequency was demonstrated to be so dramatically in- creased in centenarians and for which there is plausible biological mechanism to explain the association. Although the effectofthevaline405alleleonthestruc- ture and function of the CETP protein has not been studied, homozygosity for the valine allele has been shown to re- sultinsignificantlydecreasedCETPcon- centrations,34-36 aswedemonstrated;and significantly decreased CETP activ- ity,37-39 as confirmed by Boekholdt and Thompson.40 Furthermore, in 2 popu- lations, each with more than 1000 par- ticipants, valine 405 homozygosity was associated with a 6.5-mg/dL or approxi- mately 13% increase41 and approxi- mately 4% increase42 in HDL choles- terol. Although this VV homozygosity ap- pears in less than 20% of the offspring,

plexity emphasizes that changes in the functionality of HDL, some through changes in mass or size, may have pleio- tropic antiaging effects.

study cannot directly answer this ques- tion, we suggest that lipoprotein con- centrations and particle sizes are ex- cellent causal biological candidates. As is the case for HDL levels, HDL and LDL particle sizes are significantly larger in women than in men, and may explain in part why women have lower CVD in- cidence rates and have higher life ex- pectancies than men. Small LDL par- ticlespenetratemorereadilyintoarterial tissue, bind more tightly to arterial pro- teoglycans, are oxidized more rapidly than larger LDL particles, and are as- sociated with endothelial dysfunc- tion, all mechanisms involved in the de- velopment of CVD.15,24 Therefore, large LDL particle size may be important in protecting the vascular bed from age- related atherosclerosis and thus pro- moting exceptional longevity. Simi- larly, small HDL particle size has been demonstrated in patients with CVD,25 and some lipid-lowering drugs may pro- tect from CVD by shifting the HDL par- ticles to larger sizes that are similar to those observed in patients without CVD.26 Increased HDL concentration and particle size are likely to underlie the beneficial effects of exercise on the cardiovascular system and other age- related phenotypes.27 However, causal- ity between HDL particle size and CVD has been debated because of its asso- ciation with small LDL particles and in- creased triglycerides.

In population studies, there is a strong inverse correlation of plasma lev- els of LDL and very LDL to HDL levels and HDL and LDL particle size.12,31 Our study shows that the levels of HDL and LDL, and their respective apolipopro- teins and particle sizes, are correlated with each other. We used ordered lo- gistic regression analysis to untangle these measures. Our analysis indi- cates that LDL and HDL particle sizes remained significant predictors of hav- ing longevity even after taking into ac- count absolute levels of lipids, lipopro- teins, and BMI. This large lipoprotein particle size phenotype is also evident in the offspring of long-lived pro- bands. We interpret these data to indi- cate that lipoprotein particle size is an independent heritable predictor of lon- gevity. Indeed, there is recent compel- ling evidence implicating LDL lipopro- tein particle size as a stronger predictor of CVD than LDL levels.31 Yet it is pos- sible that the lipoprotein levels and not the particle sizes directly may be rel- evant for their protective actions, even if they do decline with aging.

In support of causal relationship between lipoprotein sizes and age- related diseases, offspring have signifi- cantly less hypertension and CVD, and lipoprotein sizes distinguish between those with and without these condi- tions. Insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with significantly lower HDL and LDL particle sizes.32 The fre- quency of insulin resistance, which is the hallmark of the metabolic syn- drome of aging, is significantly lower in the offspring. Furthermore, the in- cidence of insulin resistance in pro- bands is much less than would be ex- pected (approximately 50% after age 70 years).18 The lipoprotein sizes re- ported in probands are significantly larger than these reported in a control group for the insulin resistance and dia- betes study,32 further supporting the clinical significance of relative small changes in their sizes and outcomes.

Until recently, HDL cholesterol was thought to exert its effects through re- verse cholesterol transport. The abil- ity of HDL to clear cholesterol from the endothelium and peripheral tissues may have systemic protective effects from li- potoxicity similar to that obtained in ca- loric-restricted rodents, whose life span is dramatically prolonged.28 In addi- tion to its role in lipid metabolism, other beneficial biological properties of HDL have been described, including anti- inflammatory, antioxidant, antiaggre- gatory, anticoagulant, and profibrino- lytic activities, which are exerted by HDL particles and other components, through their interactions with sev- eral apolipoproteins, enzymes, and even specific phospholipids.29,30 This com-

Although this VV homozygosity ap- pears in less than 20% of the offspring, more than 40% of offspring have very

spouses or neighbors of the offspring, neither of which were enriched with longevity genes, and the cases were the offspring group who were children of the probands. Therefore, differences in environment, social, and economic in- fluences are unlikely to arise. The ad- ditional use of the Framingham Off- spring Study as a second control group with similar findings further supports the validity of our findings. A final limi- tation of the case-control design, which does affect this study, is that outcome incidence rates and relative risks can- not be estimated. Although we are aware of the limitations of a case- control study, this approach in fami- lies with exceptional longevity and where genetic markers are tested may be the best possible approach.

high levels and increased size of HDL. This discrepancy may be explained by other variants in CETP or in other genes that modulate lipoprotein particle con- centrations and size. Other single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CETP genes did not differ in frequency be- tween our groups. Moreover, we ana- lyzed regulatory domains of hepatic li- pase, which also regulates lipoprotein size, and failed to note any increased fre- quency of any of the variants we found. Recently, Arai et al43 investigated more than 200 Japanese centenarians for as- sociation between a CETP TaqI poly- morphism (but not the I405V polymor- phism) as well as hepatic lipase polymorphisms, and did not demon- strate an increase in frequency in this population.BecauseCETPdeficiencyhas not been previously associated with in- creased LDL size, additional genes that modulateLDLsizeorenvironmentalfac- tors are likely to be involved in the regu- lation of LDL particle sizes and may be necessary to enhance the probability of exceptional longevity. Whether lipo- proteinparticlesizeandtheI405VCETP polymorphism are important predic- tors of longevity in other populations re- mains to be determined.

Case-control studies are subject to problems that sometimes limit their va- lidity. However, in the case of genetic studies, these limitations are fre- quently overcome. A major problem af- fecting case-control studies is biased- recall ascertainment of exposure status. When the exposure is a genotype, how- ever, this problem cannot arise. Simi- larly, the use of prevalent cases and control groups entails length-biased sampling; but with longevity as the out- come, once again the problem is nul- lified. Case-control studies cannot by themselves establish a causal relation- ship but with a genotype exposure, at least the possibility of reverse causal- ity is entirely excluded and the expo- sure is unequivocally known to pre- cede the outcome. The recruitment of cases and control groups from sepa- rate population groups is another com- mon source of bias in case-control stud- ies. In our situation, the controls were
