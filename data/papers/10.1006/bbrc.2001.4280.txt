view (1). They are the best example of successful aging, and represent a valuable model for studying the ge- netic factors impinging on survival (risk factors for cancer and other major age-related diseases) (2). In fact, some risk factors for age-related diseases are hy- porepresented in centenarians (3), whilst others are unexpectedly present in healthy centenarians at equal or even increased frequency, in comparison to controls (4–7). Nevertheless, a number of studies revealed that in centenarians important changes occur in genetic variability of loci which are not risk factors for specific diseases, but are rather responsible for modulating the individual capacity to cope with stress, such as Ty- rosine Hydroxilase and mitochondrial DNA (8, 9). In this scenario, enzymes which are involved in the me- tabolism of potentially dangerous endogenous and ex- ogenous compounds, are likely to play a major role in human longevity. A variety of polymorphisms have been reported in these genes, and have been associated with susceptibility to cancer (10) and other age-related diseases such as Parkinson disease (11). Among these candidate genes, there are Phase 1 (oxidation, activa- tion) and Phase 2 (conjugation, detoxification) drug metabolizing genes, such as cytochrome P450 genes and glutathione S-transferase enzymes (GST). Cyto- chrome P450 genes are involved in the first step of the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons con- tained in tobacco smoke, whilst GST genes are involved in the detoxification of several drugs, environmental substances, and carcinogenic compounds. In particu- lar, common polymorphisms leading to complete dele- tion of the gene cause a loss of GST functional activity. Individuals with such gene deletions exhibit decreased conjugation activity, and are consequently exposed to higher internal doses of potentially toxic intermediary

Drug metabolizing enzymes are involved in the detox- ification of several drugs, environmental substances, and carcinogenic compounds, and their polymorphisms have been associated with risk for a variety of cancer. In this paper, we compared the frequency of polymor- phisms in cytochrome P450-1A1 gene (CYP1A1), a phase 1 gene (oxidation, activation), and of two polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase enzymes (GSTM1, GSTT1), two phase 2 genes (conjugation, detoxification). Two groups were studied and compared, i.e., 94 nonagenari- ans and centenarians and 418 control subjects of younger age. A significant difference in the proportion of nonagenarians and centenarians homozygotes for a GSTT1 deletion (28%) was observed in comparison to control subjects (19%, P 5 0.03). The distribution of the other gene polymorphisms did not differ in the two groups. These findings on phase 2 drug-metabolizing en- zyme gene polymorphisms may help in disentangling gene–environmental interactions which can have a role in successful aging and longevity, as well as in cancer incidence in the oldest old. © 2001 Academic Press

metabolites from xenobiotic agents. Data on the fre- quency of polymorphisms in some phase 1 genes (CYP2E1 (12), CYP2C19 (14), CYP2D6 (13, 14)) and phase 2 genes (NAT2 (13, 14), GSTM1 (13)), as well as other polymorphisms associated with cancer suscepti- bility, i.e., p53 (15, 16), did not show any difference between centenarians and the general population. In this study, we focussed our attention on other members of phase 1 gene family (CYP1A1), and phase 2 genes (GSTT1 and GSTP1) never studied before in centenar- ians, as well as on a gene which has been studied in French centenarians with negative results (GSTM1) (13). The hypothesis was that the frequency of the least favorable polymorphisms should be lower in centenar- ians than that observed in the general population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Nonagenarians and centenarians in good health, i.e., belonging to category A and B according to Franceschi et al. (1) were identified in Northern Italy (Milan, Modena, Parma, Genoa), as part of an ongo- ing multicentric study in Italy with the aim of studying the mecha- nisms responsible for successful aging (1). A total of 94 subjects were included in the present study. The mean age of the group was 100.2 6 2.1 years (range 95–105 years; median 100 years), 22% of whom were males and 88% females. The male to female ratio was in agreement with the recent data on the nation-wide study on Italian centenarians (1). None was a current smoker. In the rest of the present paper, for simplicity, these very old people are collectively indicated as “centenarians”.

c “Null” refers to homozygotes for deletion allele, while “Present” refers to both homozygotes and heterozygotes which cannot be ex- perimentally distinguished.

Statistical Analysis

Chi-square was used to compare the frequency of each polymor- phism and of the combined genotype, in centenarians and in control subjects. Monte Carlo simulation was used (19), to take into account for cells with small numbers. Data were adjusted for sex, in order to control for a possible confounding factor, by multiple logistic regres- sion, using the SAS package version 6.12. Linear regression analysis was used to test the association between age and each genotype.

Control subjects were a sample of 418 healthy volunteers of the same ethnic group as the nonagenarians and centenarians, recruited in Northern Italy to study the geographic distribution of drug- metabolizing enzymes polymorphisms. They were recruited among blood donors (n 5 98), or health screening programs (n 5 320). All the subjects gave informed consent to participate in the study. The mean age of the control subjects was 46.0 6 11.3 years (range 4–82 years; median 47 years), 46% males and 54% females. As by study

RESULTS

The frequency of the polymorphisms analyzed in this is reported in Table 1.

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes, and polymorphisms were assessed by PCR method, as previously described (17, 18). A multiplex PCR method was used to detect the presence or absence of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in genomic DNA samples. This method uses both GST primer sets (GSTM1, 59 GAACTCCCTGAAAAGCTAAAGC 59 GTTGGGCTCAAATATACG- GTGG; and GSTT1, 59 TCCTTACTG GTCCTCACATCTC, 59 TCAC- CGGATCATGGCCAGCA) in the same PCR and includes a third primer set for albumin (59 GCCCTCTGCTAACAAGTCCTAC, 59 GC- CCTAAAAAGAAAATCGCCAATC), and uses 30 cycles with denatur- ing at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 64°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. For analysis of CYP1A1 the following primers were used: 59 TTAGGAGTCTTGTCTCATGCCT and 39 CAGTGAAGAG- GTGTAGCCGCT for analysis of the Msp1 RFLP using PCR condi- tions as previously described (17).

A significant difference in the proportion of centenar- ians homozygotes for GSTT1 deletion was observed, in comparison to younger subjects (28% vs 19%: x2 5 5 4.18; P 0.03). Linear regression analysis confirmed the independent association between age and GSTT1 5 5 deletion (F 4.61, P 0.032). When the analysis was restricted to control subjects below the age of 60 5 years (n 386), the results did not change (data not shown). The distribution of the other gene polymor- phisms did not differ in the two groups (CYP1A1*2A: x2 5 0.94, P 5 0.68; GSTM1: x2 5 0.10, P 5 0.74). When the multiloci genotypes for CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 were examined (Table 2), a statistical bor- derline difference was observed between centenarians and control subjects (x2 5 15.67; P 5 0.079). The difference was mainly due to the CYP1A1-GSTM1- GSTT1 combinations 1-0-2 and 1-2-2 (Table 2), both containing the combination of CYP1A1 heterozygotes and GSTT1 deletion genotypes (8% in centenarians vs

Nomenclature used: for CYP1A1, the term “wild type” refers to the homozygotes for the common allele (absence of the restriction site), “heterozygous” refers to the presence of the polymorphism on one allele, “homozygous” refers to the presence of the restriction site on both alleles. For GSTM1 and GSTT1, “null” refers to homozygotes for deletion allele, while “present” refers to both homozygotes and het- erozygotes (which cannot be distinguished by the experimental procedure).

increased frequency of alleles and genotypes conferring susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases and thrombo- sis, such as PAI-1 and ACE, have been reported in centenarians (4, 7, 20). In order to explain this para- dox, which emerged from the research on centenarians, we have proposed a mathematical model suggesting that the over-crossing of the mortality curves at certain ages can explain these phenomena (21, 22). This model assumes that a genetic risk factor can confer an in- creased risk to die until a certain age, above which its impact is nullified or reversed. This phenomenon may occur because those people who survived at very ad- vanced ages have been selected by mortality forces, and thus could benefit from those genetic variants which are detrimental for younger people. For exam- ple, a profile predisposing to hypercoagulability could be beneficial at very advanced ages, but could predis- pose to cardiovascular diseases in the middle aged people (4, 20). Accordingly, the lack of GSTT1 (or other phase 2 genes) could be related to deleterious effects in young age (high risk of cancer) but it could exert long term beneficial effects on survival, by avoiding the catabolism of important substances, which have che- mopreventive effect on cancer and other diseases. In- deed, a recent study, shows that among subjects con- suming a diet rich in isothiocyanates (a lung carcinogen inhibitor), those with deletion of GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 have higher levels of this compound in the urine than subjects with the wild type genotype (23). Another possibility is that the association be- tween GSTT1 locus and longevity regards indeed a proximate locus of unknown nature whose variants are in linkage disequilibrium with the one we studied. Further studies are needed to clarify this point.

1.5% in control subjects). According to the strong in- teraction between CYP1A1 and GSTT1, a significant difference in GSTT1 distribution between centenarians and control subjects occurred in CYP1A1 heterozygotes (x2 5 11.278; P 5 0.003), but not in CYP1A1 wild 5 5

The frequency of the GSTP1 polymorphism did not show any difference between centenarians and control subjects (data not shown).

In conclusion, GSTT1 can be added to the list of candidate longevity genes which have been identified so far, and it can open a new perspective on a possible “pharmacogenetics of longevity”.

DISCUSSION

In this study we confirm the lack of association be- tween GSTM1 and longevity, as previously described in a French population of centenarians (3), and we report new data for two polymorphisms in drug metab- olizing enzymes which have never been tested in cen- tenarians, namely CYP1A1 and GSTT1. We did not find any difference in the frequency of CYP1A1 in centenarians, as compared to control subjects of younger age. A significant increase in the GSTT1 ho- mozygous deletion in centenarians was observed, and this is the first report of a significant difference regard- ing drug metabolizing enzyme gene polymorphisms in centenarians. This finding is rather unexpected, as the deletion of the GST genes is considered a risk factor for cancer, causing the lack of conjugation of toxic com- pounds of environmental origin. Accordingly, a de- crease in frequency of the GSTT1 deletion in centenar- ians would be expected. However, this finding is not totally surprising and it is not the first description of an increased risk factor in centenarians. Indeed, an
