The genetic contribution to the variation in human lifespan is 25%. Despite the large number of identified disease-susceptibility loci, it is not known which loci influence population mortality. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 7729 long-lived individuals of European descent (aged over 85 years) and 16 121 younger controls (below age 65) followed by replication in an additional set of 13 060 long-lived individuals and 61 156 controls. In addition, we performed a subset analysis in cases aged over 90 years. We observed genome-wide significant association with longevity as reflected by survival to ages beyond 90 years at a novel locus rs2149954 on chromosome 5q33.3 (OR =1.10, P=1.743×10^-28). We also confirmed association of rs4420638 on chromosome19q13.32 (OR=0.72, P=3.40×10^-36), representing the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus. In a prospective meta-analysis (n=34 103), the minor allele of rs2149954 (T) on chromosome 5q33.3 associates with increased survival (HR=0.95, P=0.003). This allele has previously been reported to associate with low blood pressure in middle age. Interestingly, the minor allele (T) associates with decreased cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of blood pressure. We report on the first GWAS-identified longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3 influencing survival in the general European population. The minor allele of this locus associates with low blood pressure in middle age, although the contribution of this allele to survival may be less dependent on blood pressure. Hence, the pleiotropic mechanisms by which this intragenic variation contributes to lifespan regulation have to be elucidated.

INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, human life expectancy has increased remarkably over the last two centuries (1), although healthy life expectancy lags behind. Citizens of the European Union, for example, spend only 75-80% of their lifespan in good health (2). Families in which longevity clusters form an exception in this sense by showing beneficial or youthful profiles for many metabolic and immune-related parameters (3-7) and a low prevalence of common diseases from middle age onwards (5,8,9). Therefore, the genome of long-lived individuals is investigated to identify variants that promote healthy aging and protect against age-related disease. This is a major challenge because the genetic component of lifespan variation in the population at large has been estimated to be only 25% (10,11) and is assumed to be determined by many still uncharacterized genes (12,13). Genetic influences on human longevity are expected to reflect longevity assurance mechanisms acting across species (14), as well as more heterogeneous population-specific effects. Although numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified loci involved in common, age-related diseases (15), the corresponding susceptibility loci do not explain the genetic component of human longevity (16). GWAS for human longevity have thus far failed to identify genome-wide significant loci besides the well-known TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus (17-19).

The discovery-phase meta-analysis of cases aged 85 years (n=7729) showed genome-wide significant association with survival into old age at one locus, the previously identified TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus (17,21) (rs4420638 (G); odds ratio (OR)=0.71, P=6.14×10^-19; Table 1). No gender-dependent effects were observed in the sex-stratified analysis of the cases aged over 85 years (Supplementary Material, Table S4). The discovery-phase meta-analysis of the cases aged over 90 years (n=5406) showed a similar result, i.e. the TOMM40/APOEIn order to identify novel loci involved in lifespan regulation, a meta-analysis was conducted on GWAS data from 7729 long-lived cases (85 years) and 16,121 younger controls (<65 years) from 14 studies originating from 7 European countries (see Supplementary Material, Table S1). For each study, cases and controls were from the same country. Given the higher heritability of longevity at older ages (11,20), we performed a subset analysis in which we compared cases aged 90 years (n=5406) with 15,112 controls (<65 years) from the corresponding control cohorts. Replication was performed in 13,060 cases aged 85 years (of which 7330 were 90 years) and 61,156 controls from 6 additional studies, of which 3 originated from European countries not represented in the discovery phase meta-analysis (Supplementary Material, Table S1). Analysis of each study was performed using a logistic regression-based method, and results were adjusted for study-specific genomic inflation factors (λ) (Supplementary Material, Table S2). Meta-analysis was performed on 2,480,356 (<85 years) and 2,470,825 (<90 years) imputed SNPs using a fixed-effect approach, and results showed that nine loci had more than one SNP with P<1x10-5 and twelve loci had more than one SNP with P<1x10-4.

To determine the association of rs4420638 (TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus) and rs2149954 (chromosome 5q33.3 locus) with longitudinal survival, we performed a prospective meta-analysis of the two SNPs in 34,103 individuals aged 30-105 years from eleven different cohorts, of which 8582 had died after a mean follow-up time ranging from 2.2 to 17.4 years. Carriers of the minor allele of rs4420638 (G) showed significantly higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, P 0.019), whereas carriers of the minor allele of rs2149954 (T) demonstrated significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR 0.95, P 0.003; see Supplementary Material, Table S6). Furthermore, rs2149954 had an effect on non-CVD mortality (HR 0.86, P 0.002) (Supplementary Material, Table S7). The Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome-Wide Replication And Meta-Analysis (CARDIoGRAM) GWAS also showed a significant association of rs2149954 with a decreased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 0.96, P 0.011) (Supplementary Material, Table S8). Additionally, two SNPs on chromosome 5q33.3 in high LD with rs2149954, rs9313772 (r2=0.928) and rs11953630 (r2=0.854), have previously been reported to associate with blood pressure and hypertension (24,25). As expected, examining rs2149954 in the International Consortium for Blood Pressure GWAS (24) showed a significant association of the minor allele with lower diastolic (P 3.46x10-25) and systolic (P 6.55x10-26) blood pressure (Supplementary Material).

To gain insight into the mechanism by which the chromosome 5q33.3 locus might promote human longevity, we analyzed the cause-specific mortality of rs2149954. Carriers of the minor allele of rs2149954 have a lower mortality risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR 0.86, P 0.004), which mainly appeared to be caused by protection from stroke (HR 0.60, Table 1). Results of the discovery phase, replication phase, and joint analysis of cases aged 85-90 years are summarized in Table 1. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the meta-analysis results of the discovery-phase analysis of survival aged 90 years using the APOE gene is shown in Figure 1.Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of Variant Associations (MAGENTA) (33), as well as examination of interconnectivity of implicated genes using Gene Relationships Across Implicated Loci (GRAIL) (34) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3 and Table S11), provided no firm clues for potential pathways involved in human longevity. 

Fine mapping and functional characterization: 

The newly identified longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3 is located in an intergenic region on chromosome 5q33.3, 302 kb downstream of the EBF1 gene. To determine the functional impact of this locus, we first identified the SNPs in LD with rs2149954 (r2 > 0.8) using the 1000 Genomes CEU Phase 1 data implemented in HaploReg v2 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php) (35). In total, we identified 25 SNPs, spanning a region of 22.3 kb (Supplementary Material, Table S12).

Subsequently, we examined the potential effects of these SNPs on gene expression using several eQTL databases. None of the SNPs showed an association with gene expression in the various examined tissues, so it is still unclear in which tissue(s) the locus exerts its longevity-promoting effect. We did, however, find some promising functional implications of this locus, i.e., the presence of multiple DNase I hypersensitivity sites, transcription factor binding sites, and enhancer histone marks, by exploring ENCODE data using HaploReg v2 (35) and RegulomeDB (http://www.regulomedb.org/) (36) (Supplementary Material, Table S12).

Very recently, a large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA), RP11-524N5.1, has been annotated right on top of our locus. The poly(A) features of this lincRNA are supported by PolyA-seq reads from liver, muscle, and testis. PhastCons 44-way alignment supports conservation of the transcription start site (TSS), 3' UTR and the third, fifth and last exon of the lincRNA transcript (Fig. 5). The transcript does not align to the mouse genome, but orthologous transcripts are found in other primate genome sequences, suggesting that this is a primate-specific lincRNA.

Figure 2. Results of the discovery phase analysis. Manhattan plot presenting the 2log P-values from the discovery phase analysis of cases aged 85 years (A) and 90 years (B). The loci that showed a genome-wide significant association after the joint analysis of the discovery and replication phase (chromosome 19q13.32 and 5q33.3) are shown in red.

Despite the highly interesting association of the minor allele of rs2149954 with low blood pressure and a decreased risk for CAD, stroke, and mortality, its association with decreased all-cause mortality was not influenced by blood pressure in two studies of participants aged 75 years (PROSPER and Leiden 85-plus study Cohort II; Supplementary Material, Table S10). This may indicate that at higher ages, this locus influences longevity via pathways additional to those involved in blood pressure regulation.

DISCUSSION: 

We have performed the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis for human longevity, in which a novel locus on chromosome 5q33.3 associating with survival beyond 90 years was identified. The minor allele of rs2149954 (T) promotes human longevity by reducing the risk of mortality owing to stroke and non-cardiovascular causes. In addition, this allele has previously been associated with low blood pressure, which may explain the protection from CVD mortality risk in middle age. At ages above 80 years, however, low SBP associates with increased mortality (37, 38). Hence, the observed blood pressure-independent association of the minor allele with mortality at 75 years may be due to pleiotropic effects on other mortality-related clinical parameters. Examination of publicly available data of several large GWAS consortia for association of the locus with parameters related to glucose and fat metabolism provided as yet no clues for other potentially involved mechanisms.

Phenotypic characterization and pathway analysis: 

In an attempt to identify the underlying mechanism by which this novel longevity locus at chromosome 5q33.3 could influence human longevity, we examined rs2149954 in the published data of several large GWAS consortia for association with metabolic traits in generally middle-aged individuals. None of the investigated traits, i.e., 2 h glucose (OGTT), Hb Ac, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), b-cell activity (HOMA-B), total/HDL/LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and20q13.2 rs8126377 20 51 590 254 TSHZ2, ZNF217 G Discovery 5209 14 893 0.057 0.068 0.75 0.66 0.85 3.38 1025 Replication 7278 60 647 0.063 0.054 1.04 0.95 1.13 0.309 Joint 12,487,755,540 0.94 0.87-1.00, with a heterogeneity of only 0.117 and an EAF of the analyzed individuals pooled for the effect allele; OR represents the odds ratio for the effect allele; and the abbreviation CI refers to the confidence interval of the analysis, which is set at a confidence level of 95%. It should be noted that genotyping of this SNP with the Sequenom MassARRAY system for the replication phase failed, and that SNPs in bold overlap with Table 1.

The logio(p-value) and position on chr19 (Mb) are shown in the table above along with other relevant data on this topic. The figure below shows regional association plots for chromosome19q13.32 and chromosome5q33.3 loci based on data from cases aged over ninety years.

In Figure4, forest plots for rs4420638 and rs2149954 are represented in A and B, respectively, showing odds ratios with a confidence interval of about ninety-five percent for cohorts analyzed in both discovery and replication phases.

The newly annotated lincRNA is not yet available in the large eQTL databases, and further functional studies are required to illuminate the mechanism by which this locus influences human longevity. Rs2149954 is located in an intergenic region on chromosome 5q33.3 between CLINT1 and EBF1. The presence of several regulatory elements in this region implies that transcription factor binding and/or expression of (nearby) genes could be influenced. The currently available eQTL databases did not provide evidence for such effects, which might be due to the limited tissue diversity of the databases. The effects of the chromosome 5q33.3 locus on human longevity might be exerted through the lincRNA, which has recently been annotated.

Figure5 shows the chromosomal region around rs2149954, which contains a lincRNA (RP11-524N5.1) for which the poly(A) features are supported by PolyA-seq reads from liver, muscle, and testis.

The low contrast between cases and controls likely has reduced our probability of identifying longevity loci. There were no genome-wide significant hits for human longevity or mortality besides the well-known TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus. The FOXO3A locus showed only moderate evidence for association with survival at ninety years in the discovery phase of our GWAS.

Finally, potential confounders such as smoking behavior were not adequately measured in most elderly cohorts, but none of the SNPs previously associated with smoking behavior in cohorts from European descent showed differences between cases (over eighty-five years) and controls in the joint analysis of the discovery and replication phase.Smoking behavior. However, as the frequency of these proxy SNPs for smoking behavior is similar between cases and controls, we expect no obvious differences in smoking behavior between the groups. (10,11) and is assumed to be determined by many genes (12,13). Furthermore, the genetic heterogeneity in ageing and lifespan regulation is expected to be high because individual genes may contribute by a diversity of late-acting deleterious stochastic (germline) variation resulting in a genetic component that is hard to disentangle (13). GWAS of complex late-onset diseases, such as osteoarthritis and Alzheimer's disease, with sample sizes comparable to our current study (4345), have identified more loci compared with GWAS of longevity. This most likely reflects the greater inherent complexity of the longevity trait, with its diverse spectrum of biological pathways subject to intrinsic and extrinsic (environmental) interactions. Hence, even larger GWAS (>50,000 long-lived individuals) may be required to identify additional longevity loci, preferably in the most stringent phenotype, i.e., the oldest old. APOE/APOC1 locus, we identified a novel locus on chromosome 5q33.3 that associates with survival beyond 90 years. Although rs2149954 is associated with survival beyond 90 years at a genome-wide significant level in our study, replication in additional cohorts from European as well as non-European descent is warranted. The minor allele of the lead SNP at this locus, rs2149954, promotes human longevity in a prospective meta-analysis by lowering the risk of mortality owing to stroke and non-cardiovascular causes. The locus harbors a lincRNA and is implicated in blood pressure regulation, but the mechanism by which it influences longevity likely also involves other traits. Western populations, the human longevity trait suffers from etiological heterogeneity. Lifespan extension in past generations owing to non-genetic factors likely created phenocopies diluting the genetic component of survival to ages 85 years. The genetic contribution to survival to ages 100 years is higher but will render smaller sample sizes for GWAS. This may explain MATERIALS AND All studies were analyzed separately using CC-assoc (https://www.msbi.nl/dnn/Research/Genetics/Software/TestsforGWAS inrelatedindividuals(cc_assoc).aspx), which is based on a modified version of the score test that takes into account imputation uncertainty and familial relatedness (46). SNPs with low imputation quality (R2 < 0.40) and a MAF of <1% or <5% (if T n ≥ 200) were excluded from analysis in the discovery cases phase. Adjustment for population stratification of the discovery studies was performed by multiplying the R2-adjusted variances T of the score statistic with the genomic inflation factor (λ range Study populations The discovery analysis was performed in 7729 cases that survived to ages 85 years (of which 5406 also survived to ages 90 years) and 16,121 controls below 65 years at baseline, from 14 studies. Replication was performed in 13,060 cases that survived to ages 85 years (of which 7330 also survived to ages 90 years) and 61,156 controls below 65 years at baseline, from six additional studies. All individuals were of European descent. The details of the discovery and replication studies can be found in Supplementary Material, Tables S1 and S2. Some cohorts only provided controls (GOYA, NTR, SU.VI.MAX, TwinsUK and WTCCC2) or only cases (BELFAST, CEPH centenarian cohort, Danish longevity study I/II, Leiden 85-plus Study I/II and Newcastle 85 Study), whereas others contained both (Calabria cohort, deCODE, EGCUT, GEHA Study, German longevity study, Leiden Longevity Study, Rotterdam Study I/II and TwinGene). The names of the studies in the tables and figures are based on the names of the cohorts containing the cases. The cases and controls used for each study originated from the same country (Supplementary Material, Table S1). The only exception is BELFAST (Northern Ireland), for which we used controls from the NTR (Netherlands). A check-in the PROSPER study, which includes individuals from Northern Ireland and the Netherlands, showed that the allele frequencies in control individuals from both countries are similar for our SNPs (data not shown). All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the relevant institutional review boards. Meta-analyses For the meta-analyses, a fixed-effect approach was used. Scores and variances of the studies were combined to obtain a single meta-statistic, which was adjusted using the genomic inflation factor (λ 1.019, discovery phase only) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). For(deCODE and the Danish longevity study II). Prospective analysis of rs2149954 and rs4420638 was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age at baseline, sex, and study-specific covariates. The details about each of the analyzed cohorts are summarized in Supplementary Material, Table S5.

Pathway analysis: For the pathway analysis, we used GSEA implemented in MAGENTA (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/magenta/) (33). In short, each SNP is mapped to a gene considering a window of 110 kb upstream and 40 kb downstream around the genes. Subsequently, each gene is assigned a gene association score based on the SNP with the lowest P-value, which is mapped to that gene, and this score is adjusted for confounding factors like gene size and the amount of SNPs per kb. Genes within the HLA region were removed from analysis owing to high LD and high gene density in that region. The GSEA algorithm tests for over-representation of adjusted gene scores in a given pathway using a pre-defined score rank cutoff (in our case, the 95th and 75th percentile). The generated statistic is then compared with 10,000-1,000,000 gene sets of identical size randomly sampled from the genome to generate an empirical P-value for each pathway. In total, 3216 pathways from Gene Ontology, PANTHER, Ingenuity, KEGG, REACTOME, and BIOCARTA were tested. Pathways were considered significant if the FDR-adjusted P-value (the 95th or 75th percentile) was <0.05.
