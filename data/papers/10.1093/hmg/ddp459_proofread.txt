FOXO1A and FOXO3A are two members of the FoxO family. FOXO3A has recently been linked to human longevity in Japanese, German and Italian populations. Here we tested the genetic contribution of FOXO1A and FOXO3A to the longevity phenotype in Han Chinese population. Six tagging SNPs from FOXO1A and FOXO3A were selected and genotyped in 1817 centenarians and younger individuals. Two SNPs of FOXO1A were found to be associated with longevity in women (P = 0.01-0.005), whereas all three SNPs of FOXO3A were associated with longevity in both genders (P = 0.005-0.001). One SNP from FOXO1A was not associated with longevity. In haplotype association tests, the OR (95% CI) for haplotypes TTG and CCG of FOXO1A in association with female longevity were 0.72 (0.58-0.90) and 1.38 (1.08-1.76), P = 0.0033 and 0.0063, respectively. The haplotypes of FOXO3A were associated with longevity in men [GTC: OR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.51-0.86), P = 0.0014; CGT: OR (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.12-1.94), P = 0.0035] and in women [GTC: OR (95% CI) = 0.75 (0.60-0.94), P = 0.0094; CGT: OR (95% CI) = 1.47 (1.16-1.86), P = 0.0009]. The haplotype association tests were validated by permutation analysis.

The association of FOXO1A with female longevity was replicated in a sample of 700 centenarians and younger individuals that were geographically different from the original population.

Thus, we demonstrate that, unlike FOXO3A, FOXO1A is more closely associated with human female longevity, suggesting that the genetic contribution to longevity trait may be affected by gender.

INTRODUCTION

Human longevity is a complex trait affected by both genetic and environmental factors (1,2). How the genetic determinants contribute to longevity has provoked great interest over the past decades. A twin-based study suggested that genetic components may account for over 25% of the variation in the longevity trait (3). Later, it was found that genetic factors have increasing effects, particularly after the age of 60 (4). Although longevity may not correlate perfectly with health, centenarians have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and live significantly longer than non-centenarians. This suggests that genetic contributions to longevity are, at least in part, due to protective effects against disease. Therefore, the search for longevity-associated genes should not only lead to an understanding of the fundamental aspects of human aging but also to the identification of new targets beneficial for medical care.

On the other hand, gender effects on longevity can be modified by both genetic and environmental factors (28,29), but how genetic determinants interact with gender and play a role in longevity is not fully understood (30). Previously, it was shown that increased dFOXO, a form of FoxOs in D. melanogaster, extends female lifespanIn Table 1, the differences between the case and control groups for the listed parameters were evaluated by Student's t-test. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Single SNP association analysis was conducted on six SNPs (rs17630266, rs2755209, and rs2755213 for FOXO1A; rs2253310, rs2802292, and rs4946936 for FOXO3A) by direct sequencing in all selected individuals. No significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test was found for all six SNPs in both populations. In sex-combined centenarians and controls, except for SNP rs17630266, the minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of both rs2755209 and rs2755213 of FOXO1A were significantly lower in the centenarian group than in control. In addition to genetic and environmental factors, gender also has a strong effect on the human longevity phenotype. It is well-known that females have a longer life than males (25). A number of studies have documented that females account for a much larger percentage of the centenarian population (26). In the 1998 baseline survey of the Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS), we found that the ratio of males to females in centenarians is 1:4 (Table 1).

Table 1 presents the characteristics of populations including case (n=761) and control (n=1056) for population 1, and case (n=350) and control (n=350) for population 2. The data are presented as mean+SEM (standard error of the mean). P-values are calculated from t-test comparing case and control groups within population. Case refers to centenarians while control refers to individuals from general population. The table lists gender (m/f), age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Table 2 shows the allelic association of FOXO1A and FOXO3A with longevity (sex-combined in population 1). The table includes SNP, allele (major/minor), function, MAF (case/control), P, OR (95% CI), P bP, PW (a<0.05), and HWT. MAF refers to minor allele frequency; P refers to P-value from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test; OR (95% CI) refers to odds ratio with 95% confidence interval; P bP is corrected P by Bonferroni step-down method; PW is power to reach an alpha level of 0.05 with a given population size; NC refers to not calculated; 3'-UTR refers to 3-untranslated region.

Table 3 presents gender effects on allelic association of FOXO1A and FOXO3A with longevity trait in population. The table lists SNP, male, female, MAF (case/control), OR (95% CI), P bP, and HWT. MAF refers to minor allele frequency; OR (95% CI) refers to odds ratio with 95% confidence interval; P refers to P-value from x2 test; bP is corrected P by Bonferroni step-down method.

Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype association analysis was performed and presented in J IV 0.90. Haplotypes with a frequency of more than 5% were subjected to an association test with longevity. We tested the distributions of seven selected haplotypes, five from FOXO1A and two from FOXO3A, in female centenarians and controls. The haplotypes TTG and CCG of FOXO1A as well as GTC and CGT of FOXO3A presented significant differences in their distributions between case and control with statistical power greater than 0.96. For FOXO1A, the frequency of haplotype TTG was significantly lower in centenarians than in controls, while CCG showed the opposite. A permutation test was used to correct multiple comparisons. The permutation P-values were 0.024 and 0.046, respectively (Supplementary Material, Table S2). For FOXO3A, GTC lost its statistical difference in permutation analysis. CGT appeared more frequently in centenarians than in controls (permutation P-values less than 0.009; Supplementary Material, Table S2). 

Genotype association analysis was performed to test the inheritance models through which FOXO1A and FOXO3A are associated with longevity. The test was conducted using logistic regression with adjustment for BMI and SBP. For FOXO1A, two of its SNPs, rs2755209 and rs2755213, were associated with female longevity in a dominant and additive model (P less than 0.010.0.76 (0.62-0.92) 0.005 0.003 0.324/0.389 0.97 0.75 (0.60-0.94) 0.011 0.009 MAF, minor allele frequency; P, P-value from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test; OR (95% CI), odds ratio with 95% confidence interval; P, P-value from x2 HWT test; aP, adjusted P for BMI.

DISCUSSION Replication study Three hundred fifty female centenarians and 350 geographically matched younger female individuals were referred to as Population 2 (Table 1) and used for replicating the finding that FOXO1A is associated with female longevity. We found that the MAFs of SNPs rs2755209 and rs2755213 from FOXO1A were significantly reduced in the centenarian group compared with control (adjusted P < 0.025 and <0.009, respectively) while that of SNP rs17630266 was not distinct between the centenarian and control groups (Table 4). These results suggest that FOXO1A is associated with female longevity in Population 2.

In this study, we demonstrated that FOXO1A is strongly associated with human female longevity and validated a previous finding that FOXO3A is associated with the longevity phenotype in the Han Chinese population. The association of FOXO1A with male longevity is not statistically significant in our study. It may be possible that the small male centenarian population in this study does not allow to unveil a weak association between FOXO1A genotypes and male longevity. But it appears true that a female longevity trait is more susceptible to the genetic variations of FOXO1A.

That women live longer than men has been recognized. However, studies on identifying the genetic causes for this phenomenon are very limited and preliminary (30). Previously, Barbieri et al. (31) found that an exonic SNP replacing the amino acid Pro with Ala in peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) g-2 has different distributions between long-lived males and controls (P < 0.035), but not between female groups. Recently, it was found that an SNP (A/G)-308 in tumor necrosis factor has sex-dependent distributions, and allele A is specifically associated with male life expectancy (P < 0.019) (32). In an animal model, it has been shown that the increased expression of dFOXO is associated only with female lifespan (21). Since D. melanogaster hasBy regulating reproduction, it is uncertain whether this is sufficient to explain why FOXO1A is associated with human female longevity. In summary, this study demonstrates that FOXO1A is associated with female longevity while FOXO3A is associated with longevity in both genders. The association of both FOXO1A and FOXO3A with the human longevity trait is inherited in additive or dominant fashions. Han Chinese share the same longevity-associated haplotypes of FOXO3A with Japanese and German individuals. Although the finding that FOXO1A is not associated with male longevity has been replicated in Han Chinese and Japanese populations, the numbers of male centenarians are relatively small in both studies, so caution is needed. The association of FOXO1A and FOXO3A with human longevity needs to be validated in more ethnic groups and larger populations.

FOXO1A and FOXO3A, members of the forkhead transcription factors of the FoxO family, serve as direct downstream signaling molecules of AKT1 in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways. In vivo, FOXO1A and FOXO3A regulate the cell cycle and growth, apoptosis, DNA damage responses, and angiogenesis (33-36). Malfunctions of FOXO1A or FOXO3A are involved in various cancers, insulin resistance, altered immune responses, and organ damage (15, 22, 37-40). In the cardiovascular system, for example, FOXO1A and/or FOXO3A are important for the onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy (41, 42), cardiac hypertrophy (43, 44), and ischemic heart disease (45, 46). It is likely that FOXO1A and FOXO3A affect longevity through multiple pathways such as insulin resistance, stress responses or proneness to disease. Earlier studies have provided several lines of evidence that both FOXO1A and FOXO3A are associated with HbA1c levels and fasting plasma insulin (12, 47, 48), suggesting that their contributions to human longevity may be due to balancing insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance through insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways. The question remains why FOXO1A is more closely associated with human female longevity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study subjects: We performed the baseline survey of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) reported previously (61). In the survey, we interviewed 9093 oldest-olds aged 80-116 with a questionnaire containing 404 questions and physical tests throughout 85% of the regions of China. Among these 9093, 8441 were Han Chinese. In this study, a total of 761 centenarians (long-lived group) and 1056 unrelated younger individuals (control group) from southern China were selected and used as Population 1 for initial screening of all six SNPs. We also took 350 female centenarians and 350 younger individuals from northern China for the necessary replication of associations found in the initial screening. All participants were Han Chinese. Finger-prick blood samples from centenarians were spotted onto S&S no. 903 filter paper (Schleicher & Schuell, Germany) and stored at -48°C after the spots were completely dried. Two to three milliliters of blood were obtained from each younger individual. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their representative family members in cases of centenarians who were incapable of signing. BMI was calculated based on the formula (body weight/height2). The basic characteristics of the studied populations are presented in Table 1. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board, Institute of Molecular Medicine at Peking University. The study conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The two-tailed P-values, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals are presented for all association tests. Statistical power was calculated with the sampsi command in STATA (StataCorp LP) under a given sample size and significance level (α = 0.05).

Genotyping of SNPs: We thank all participants and their families for their commitment and enthusiastic help in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Human genomic DNA was isolated from a 5-mm diameter punch-out from each blood spot or EDTA-anticoagulated blood using the proteinase K methods described previously (62). Based on the HapMap (CHBJPT), the tagging SNPs rs17630266, rs2755209, and rs2755213 were selected for FOXO1A, and rs2253310, rs2802292, and rs4946936 for FOXO3A. DNA fragments of 200-350 bp containing SNPs were amplified by PCR from 10 ng of genomic DNA from each participant, with the primShea-Drinkwater, M., Kang, S., Joyce, E., Nicoli, J., Benson, E. et al.

Statistical methods: Allele and genotype frequencies for single SNPs were calculated and tested for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the χ2 test. Differences in allele and genotype distribution between cases (centenarians) and controls (younger population) were analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for non-genetic covariates under various genetic models that were defined as 1 (aa/Aa) versus 0 (AA) for dominant, 1 (aa) versus 0 (AA/Aa) for recessive, and 0 (AA) versus 1 (Aa) versus 2 (aa) for additive (A: major allele; a: minor allele). A Bonferroni step-down method was used for multiple comparison correction in allele association tests (63). Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype blocks (D′ > 0.90) were defined and visualized by the solid spine of LD method using Haploview 4.0 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/haploview/haploview). The haplotypes with frequency >5%.
