Genetic Analysis of TOR Complex Gene Variation With Human Longevity: A Nested Case-Control Study of American Men of Japanese Ancestry

Brian J. Morris, Timothy A. Donlon, Qimei He, John S. Grove, Kamal H. Masaki, Ayako Elliott, D. Craig Willcox, Richard Allsopp, and Bradley J. Willcox conducted a study to test the association of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms with human longevity. The study focused on capturing genetic variation across key TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2) genes MToR, RPToR, and RicToR and the important downstream effector gene RPS6Ka1. The subjects of the study were a homogeneous population of American men of Japanese ancestry who were well-characterized for aging phenotypes and had been followed for 48 years. The study used a nested case-control design involving 440 subjects aged 95 years and older and 374 controls.

The study found no association between six tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms for MToR, 61 for RPToR, seven for RicToR, or five for RPS6Ka1 with longevity. Of the 40 aging-related phenotypes studied, no significant association with genotype was found. Therefore, the common genetic variation (minor allele frequency 10%) in MToR, RPToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1 is not associated with extreme old age or aging phenotypes in this population.

Further research is needed to assess the potential genetic contribution of other mTOR pathway genes to human longevity, gene expression, upstream and downstream targets, and clinically relevant aging phenotypes.

Nutrient-sensing pathways (7,8) are pivotal to life span extension in response to caloric restriction (9,10). Despite good evidence showing that insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 and mTOR pathways are critical for life span regulation of model organisms (6,11,12), to date, attainment of extreme old age in humans has been consistently replicated only for variation in one gene in these pathways, the forkhead box O transcription factor 3 gene (FoXo3) (5,6).

Major causes of death in developed countries are influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Identification of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this complex polygenic phenotype represents a major current challenge. Because the genetic component becomes paramount for the attainment of extreme old age (13), studies of polymorphisms in genes belonging to intracellular pathways that are modulated by caloric restriction have been conducted in nonagenarian and centenarian populations (4,5). These pathways affect insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling and growth responses. The hyperfunction theory of aging postulates that in later life, the once-beneficial processes contributing to growth become deleterious by causing hypertrophic and hyperplastic pathologies (6).

mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase with crucial roles in cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, growth factors, cellular energy, and stress (6,8,13,14). Rapamycin forms a stoichiometric complex with mTOR to inhibit its kinase activity (15,16) and can thus extend mean and maximum lifespan of middle-aged male and female mice with no adverse health consequences but only benefits.

The mechanistic (formerly mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is positioned at a central hub of nutrient-sensing pathways and is pivotal to lifespan determination in model organisms. mTOR is a component of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes: TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). In mammals, two accessory proteins, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (raptor or RPTOR) and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (rictor or RICTOR), distinguish TORC1 from TORC2, respectively (19,20). mTORC1 exerts its effects on temporal control of cell growth by regulating several cellular processes, including translation, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, nutrient transport, and autophagy (14). The two TOR complexes constitute an evolutionarily conserved ancestral signaling network that responds to energy levels and sources of energy to control the fundamental process of cell growth and maintenance. In addition to its key role in aging, mTOR has been implicated in cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes (21).

The present study used cases (longevity phenotype) defined as HHP and HAAS participants who had survived beyond the upper 1% of theControls who died up to the age of 81 years (mean age at death = 78.1 ± 1.8 SD years [range: 73-81 years]), consistent with the 3.5 years longer life expectancy of Japanese American men in Hawaii (29). Analyses showed no evidence of population stratification in the dataset (5). All participants were drawn from records of study participants updated up to June 2011. Archived phenotypic data and blood samples from Examination 4 of the HHP (1991-1993), which coincided with the commencement of the HAAS, were used as the baseline exam for this nested case-control study. We had phenotype data for only 439 cases because one subject did not attend Exam 4. Participants included 3,734 men aged 71-93 years at Exam 4 (mean age: 77.9 ± 4.7 years), representing approximately 80% of the survivors from the original HHP (30). Procedures performed were in accordance with institutional guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kuakini Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants or from family representatives, if participants could not provide consent.

Here we report the results of a genetic association study of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) that provided virtually complete coverage of key mTOR complex genes MTOR, RPTOR, and RICTOR, as well as RPS6KA1, in long-lived Americans of Japanese ancestry. The study tested for association of these genetic variants with living to more than 95 years of age and with multiple aging-related parameters in these subjects.

Genotyping 
Total cellular DNA was isolated from leukocytes using the PureGene system (Gentra Systems) and quantified using PicoGreen staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). SNPs genotyped were from within the gene and from a 5-kb region of DNA flanking either end of the genes MTOR, RPTOR, RICTOR, and RPS6KA1. TagSNPs were selected using Haploview, a program that defines a haplotype based on high correlation between the first and last markers and all intermediate markers. Supplementary Figures S1-S4 show the linkage disequilibrium blocks captured by the tagSNPs used. We restricted our selection to SNPs having a minor allele frequency of 10% in the Japanese population (as indicated by the HapMap database: http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; HapMap release 27/phase II + III, Feb 2009 on NCBI B36 assembly, dbSNP b126 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). The minimal coefficient of determination (r2) value at which all alleles are to be captured was set to a threshold of .8 for the identification of all tagSNPs. Genotype data were managed through an integrated database system sample management-data processing system that has been proven to be accurate in other successful studies (5). All positive controls on each genotyping plate were evaluated for consistency. Call rates for markers exceeded 98%.

Genetic association Findings 
SNPs for MTOR, RPTOR, and RICTOR were genotyped at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center on the Illumina GoldenGate platform (high-throughput SNP genotyping on universal bead arrays (31)). SNPs for RPS6KA1 were detected by the TaqMan OpenArray System (Life Technologies). We implemented a series of quality control checks based on the Illumina metrics. For inclusion of data for a SNP, its call rate had to exceed .95 and the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium p needed to be >.01. Of the 81 tagSNPs genotyped, all met these criteria and were included. In addition, more than 96% concordance was observed for all SNPs for HapMap samples that were assayed for quality assurance.

The minor allele frequencies of each SNP tested in MTOR, RPTOR, RICTOR, and RPS6KA1 in cases and controls are presented in Tables 2-5, together with results of chi-square analyses. Differences that appeared statistically significant for two SNPs in RPTOR (rs7225574 and rs2589143) and one SNP in RICTOR (rs1239256) were lost after correction for multiple comparisons.

Phenotype-Genotype analyses 
Phenotype-genotype comparisons for each SNP with 40 different aging-related phenotypes in cases showed weak associations for 5 of 6 SNPs in MTOR, 38 of 61 in RPTOR, and 5 of 7 in RICTOR prior to correction for multiple testing (Supplementary Table S2). In all, 83 genotypic associations were observed with blood pressure (BP) and related clinicaland Exam 4 using canonical correlation. For BP, the mean of Exam 1 and Exam 2 data (substituting Exam 3 BP values if Exam 2 values were missing) was used. Variables were transformed when necessary to reduce skewness of the residuals from the regression of each phenotype on age and case-control status. The Wilks lambda test for association between the Exam 1 variables - log values of systolic and diastolic BP (log(SBP) and log(DBP)), serum cholesterol, body mass index, and log of subscapular skinfold thickness, adjusted for age at Exam 1 and case-control status was not significant (p = .29). Similarly, for the Exam 4 variables - grip strength, waist:hip ratio, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting serum glucose, log fasting insulin, log triglyceride level, and log of (101 CASI [cognitive abilities screening instrument] score), adjusted for age at Exam 4 and case-control status - Wilks test was not significant (p = .22). Although we cannot rule out associations between particular age-related phenotypes and individual SNPs, the findings suggest that overall, the actual number of associations observed did not exceed the expected numbers of associations that might be observed by chance alone.

Statistical analyses: Genotype frequencies of SNPs were evaluated for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The Pearson chi-square test was used to compare cases and controls for differences in genotype frequencies. The 95% confidence intervals for allele frequencies were calculated as described (32). For analyses of phenotypes, linear regression models were used for continuous variables (with log transformation of skewed variables) and logistic regression models were used for categorical variables to test for associations with genotypes, adjusting for case-control status and age at baseline. The analyses used the SAS statistical package.

Results: Characteristics of participants of the HHP and HAAS study population at the 1991-1993 examination when blood was drawn for genotyping in the present study (Exam 4 of the cohort). The more limited set of parameters recorded at Exam 1 (1965-1968) is also shown. Unadjusted data are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Presented are biological characteristics, general health status, disease prevalence, and functional status of long-lived cases (longevity phenotype) and average-lived controls (average phenotype). The long-lived cases were older, leaner (based on lower waist:hip ratio), had lower plasma glucose level, lower plasma insulin level, better self-rated health, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke) and cancer. The cases appeared better able to walk 0.8 km than controls, but grip strength was similar. Cognitive score was slightly higher in cases. When adjusting for age, the differences between long-lived cases became even starker.

Discussion: The present nested case-control study found no association of genetic variation in mTOR pathway genes MTOR, RPTOR, RICTOR, and RPS6KA1 with longevity (survival to age 95 years or older) in American men of Japanese ancestry.

BMI refers to body mass index, CASI to cognitive abilities screening instrument (score range: 1-100), CHD to coronary heart disease, COPD to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema), EHT to essential hypertension (moderate: systolic/diastolic BP 140-160 mmHg/90-95 mmHg or on antihypertensive medication; severe: systolic/diastolic BP >160/>95 mmHg or on antihypertensive medication), HDL to high-density lipoprotein, HOMA to homeostasis model assessment, ISH to isolated systolic hypertension (moderate: systolic BP 140-160 mmHg; severe: systolic BP >160 mmHg), and LDL to low-density lipoprotein. The percent of chi-square values that fell beyond these limits was actually less than expected: 8.6%, 1.2%, and 0%. For minor allele frequencies of 0.1-0.4 and a nominal significance level of 0.05, the study had 90% power to detect odds ratios ranging from 1.58-1.95 and 99% power to detect odds ratios of 1.83-2.36. Therefore, although almost all ancestry SNPs with at least moderate effects on longevity will create an excess of high chi-square test values, we noted a deficiency in such values (Tables 2-4). There were 81 tests for association between genetic variants (2df) and case-control status. The quantiles of chi-square for the upper 2df 10%, 5%, and 1% percentiles are 4.61, 5.99, and 9.21, respectively.

As an AI language model, I do not have enough context to know what type of data is being presented or how it should be improved. Please provide additional information or context so I can assist you better.several limitations to our study that should be noted. Firstly, we only studied men, so it is unclear whether the genotypes of the SNPs tested are associated with longevity or other aging-related phenotypes in women. Secondly, the cases and controls were from different cities, although the authors claim that population substructure differences were not detected. Thirdly, participants were genotyped at different times and centers using different Illumina platforms, which could introduce artifacts into the findings. Fourthly, there was bias in the selection of controls because only their deaths qualified them for control status, which was unavoidable. 

However, there were also advantages to our study design. The nested case-control study design allowed us to select cases and controls from an ongoing cohort study with longitudinally collected data. This eliminated recall bias because the information was collected from our subjects before case-control status was determined. Moreover, major diseases were adjudicated by a morbidity and mortality committee that used performance-based measures of physical and cognitive function to supplement self-reported information.

Although some may question the relevance of candidate gene and pathway analyses such as ours in light of advances in technologies like genome-wide association studies and next-generation sequencing, these approaches still have value. Our study involving much older (>95 years) subjects than many others may be particularly valuable because longevity genes would be more concentrated in this population. However, a major limitation is the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently high numbers of subjects older than 95 years of age to test rare variants in addition to common variants like those we tested.Several other strengths are present in our study. Firstly, the candidate genes selected for analysis were chosen a priori based on hypothesis-driven criteria. That is, studies of model organisms of aging using various methods, such as knockouts, have shown that the mTOR pathway is important for aging and longevity (46). The mTOR pathway and many of its functions appear to be evolutionarily conserved. Secondly, not only did the study involve a nested case-control design but it had a high event rate (deaths) during a long period of follow-up, which enhances statistical power. Thirdly, the HHP cohort is a highly homogeneous group of individuals and no population stratification was detected in our study participants (5).

A possible weakness was that cases and controls had an average age difference of 10.8 years, so we cannot completely exclude the possibility of confounding by birth cohort effects. There are several reasons why this is not likely: (i) There was only a 19-year difference in birth year from oldest to youngest participants; (ii) Subgroup analyses showed no differences in socioeconomic status (education and occupation) between cases and controls; and (iii) Contrary to typical cohort studies in which younger cohorts have longer survival, older participants at baseline were most likely to have lived 95 and more years. Because our study was conducted in only one population, it should be replicated in other populations. Further research should also be directed at effects of the genetic variants with aging of specific organs.

Regarding the association between the SNPs in the mTOR pathway genes examined and longevity, it remains possible that variants having a minor allele frequency less than 0.10 or variants in other genes in this pathway could have significant effect(s) on longevity or the health or rate of aging of specific organs or both. This is particularly relevant to a genetic study of the rare phenotype of attainment of extreme old age (>95 years of age in our study). As a result, it is possible that at least some of the genetic variants that contribute to this phenotype are themselves rare or were below the minor allele frequency of 10% threshold we set for selection of SNPs for testing. Further research is needed to examine the association of uncommon and rare variants of mTOR pathway genes with longevity. Indeed, disruption of mTOR signaling has been associated with sarcopenia (47), and there is evidence that rapamycin treatment can reverse age-related.

In conclusion, the present study has found no association of common genetic variation in mTOR, RPTOR, RICTOR, and RPS6KA1 with living to age 95 or older in American men of Japanese ancestry. Further studies of these and other TOR pathway genes in both sexes and in other populations may be warranted.
