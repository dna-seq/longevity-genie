and are regarded as susceptibility factors for age-related diseases. Furthermore, the CYP2C-encoding genes are known to be highly polymorphic, with a number of variants leading to changes in enzyme activity. These observations prompted us to investigate whether allelic variation in the CYP2C-encoding genes was associated with human longevity. In a compre- hensive haplotype tagging approach, we genotyped 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the CYP2C gene family (CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19) in our extensive collection of 1,384 long-lived individuals (cente- narians and nonagenarians) and 945 younger controls. None of the tested single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a significant association with the longevity phenotype at the allele, genotype, or haplotype level. These results suggest that there is no notable influence of sequence variation in the CYP2C genes on longevity in the examined German population.

the leading cause of death worldwide (12–14). Furthermore, CYP enzymes, particularly the CYP2C isoenzyme subfam- ily, are involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (15). Already more than 50 years ago, the accumula- tion of ROS was suggested to cause changes in physical or cognitive functions with ageing (16). To date, findings in the area of longevity research support a role of ROS and oxidative damage in age-related cellular decline ((17) and reviewed in (18)) and the development of age-related diseases (19).

rial trait to which various genetic and environmental factors are likely to contribute. About 30% of the varia- tion in adult life span is attributable to genetic parameters that show their strongest effect later in life (>60 years of age) (1–6). Epidemiological studies have revealed that people who survive to an exceptional old age (ie, ≥95 years) have often avoided or survived age-associated dis- eases. Hence, these long-lived individuals (LLI) show a favorable course of the ageing process and offer the unique opportunity to explore the genetic basis of the “healthy ageing” phenotype (7,8). It has been suggested that the genetic composition of the LLI differs from that of average-lived individuals in the following regards: (i) LLI are enriched for advantageous variants in so-called “longevity-enabling genes” and/or (ii) their genetic con- stitution shows a depletion of risk alleles for age-related diseases (9,10).

In humans, the CYP2 enzyme subfamily C consists of four genes (CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19) that are located next to each other on chromosome 10q (Figure 1). These enzymes are mainly expressed in human liver (20) but are also expressed in various other tissues, including the cardiovascular system, where they are in- volved in the modulation of vascular homeostasis by me- tabolizing endogenous regulators of vascular tone (21). Consequently, CYP2C inhibition has been reported to reduce ischemia–reperfusion injury in myocardial tissue (22– 24). Furthermore, the CYP2C-encoding genes are also known to be highly polymorphic. Some of these variants

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are monooxygenases that are commonly known as important drug-metabolizing enzymes (11). They are also regarded as susceptibility fac- tors for age-related cardiovascular diseases that represent

lead to a markedly reduced or no enzyme activity, whereas other alleles induce an increased activity or ex- pression. In the context of drug metabolism, the variants CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853) and 2C9*3 (rs1057910) associ- ated with reduced enzyme activity are both known to be of particular clinical relevance. Recently, the U.S. federal drug agency (Food and Drug Administration) has encouraged prospective CYP2C9 genotyping as a clinical tool to allow for individualized dose adjustment of the oral anticoagulant warfarin that is metabolized by CYP2C9 (25).

Methods

Participants

The LLI sample comprised 1,384 unrelated German study participants of exceptional age (age range: 95–109 years, mean: 98.8 years), including 616 centenarians (mean age: 101.3 years). The gender ratio was 73% females versus 27% males. The 945 German control participants were be- tween 60 and 75 years of age (mean age: 66.9 years) and matched the LLI by ancestry, gender, and geographical ori- gin within the country. A detailed description of the samples and the recruitment procedure is given elsewhere (26). All participants gave informed written consent prior to partici- pation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel.

As CYP2C enzymes also play an important role in the generation of ROS and are regarded as susceptibility factors for age-related diseases (15), they appear to be attractive candidates to be studied in the context of human longevity. Here, we performed a comprehensive fine mapping of the four CYP2C genes by testing altogether 56 single nucleo- tide polymorphisms (SNPs) in our extensive collection of

significant association, even without consideration of multiple testing (data not shown).

SNP Genotyping

DNA samples from LLI and control participants were an- alyzed for 56 SNPs in the CYP2C gene region (Figure 1, Table 1) by using the SNPlex Genotyping System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (27). The complete marker set consists of (i) a maximally informative panel of SNPs, selected through a haplotype tagging approach (based on the HapMap genotypes of Europeans with the pairwise tag- ging option; pairwise r2 ≥ .8; p > .001) to ensure that HWE most of the allelic variation of the genomic regions was cap- tured and the common haplotypes (≥2%) were represented; (ii) potentially functional SNPs that are located in exons, exon–intron boundaries, promoter regions, and 5′ and 3′ un- translated regions; and (iii) polymorphisms that have already been proven to be functionally relevant in the con- text of CYP2C enzyme activity (28–30). Of the 56 analyzed markers, 14 are located in the CYP2C8 gene, 20 SNPs in CYP2C9, 10 SNPs in CYP2C18, and 12 SNPS in CYP2C19 (Figure 1, Table 1).

The 56 SNPs form three haplotype blocks (Figure 1). Block 1 comprises 20 markers, Block 2 comprises 19 mark- ers, and Block 3 comprises 11 markers (Figure 1), which define eight common haplotypes (each present at a frequency of at least 2% in the population) for each block. None of the observed haplotypes differed significantly in frequency between cases and controls (data not shown).

Discussion

Cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially the CYP2C iso- forms, are involved in the generation of ROS (15). They are expressed in tissues of the cardiovascular system and are considered susceptibility factors for age-related diseases (15). Furthermore, the CYP2C-encoding genes are known to be highly polymorphic, with a number of variants leading to changes in enzyme activity.

These observations prompted us to investigate whether allelic variation in the CYP2C-encoding genes was associ- ated with human longevity. Altogether, we genotyped 56 markers in our extensive DNA collection of more than 2,300 LLI and controls. None of the tested SNPs or haplo- types showed a statistically significant association with lon- gevity, neither in the whole sample nor in the centenarian subset.

Statistical Analysis

were performed with c2 statistics and the appropriate degrees of freedom using the open-source analysis toolset PLINK v.1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/). p values smaller than .05 were considered nominally statistically significant, and Bonferroni correction for 56 tests was applied to the single-point results: Of the 56 tested markers, 28 were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (pairwise r2 > .8; calculated with the Haploview tagger pairwise option) so that the number of markers considered for the Bonferroni correction could be reduced to 28. As two case–control analyses (whole sample and centenarians) were performed, altogether 56 tests need to be taken into account. The software programme Haploview version 4.1 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/) was used to assess all polymorphisms for significant deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), to calculate linkage disequilibrium (r2) between each marker pair, and to conduct haplotype association analyses in blocks (31).

Candidate gene association studies have emerged as powerful tools in longevity research (32–47). So far, two longevity relevant genes (APOE and FOXO3A) have been confirmed in many different populations (32,35–37,39,48– 55). Because APOE and FOXO3A have been identified by candidate gene association studies, it seems that this method is still relevant for human longevity research, even in the era of genome-wide association studies. Although genome- wide association studies offer the advantage of detecting new longevity genes without a priori hypothesis, the power of hypothesis-driven candidate approaches is much higher than that of genome-wide association studies where millions of SNPs are tested, and multiple comparisons have to be taken into consideration as an essential part of determining statistical significance (56). Hence, so far it has been difficult to detect new longevity variants by genome-wide studies, and apart from the APOE locus, none of the reported genome-wide association studies signals achieved con- ventional levels of statistical significance (51,57,58). Altogether, candidate gene association studies still play an important role for the identification of longevity loci.

Results

The whole sample of 1,384 German LLI, a subset of 616 centenarians, and a control group of 945 younger individuals were subjected to a gender-matched case–control analysis of 56 SNPs located in the CYP2C genes (CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19). All SNPs were found to be in HWE (p > .001). Only one nominally significant association signal (rs11188059; p = .04) was observed in the analysis CCA of the centenarian sample (Table 1) that did not pass correc- tion for multiple testing (Bonferroni-adjusted p = 1, as- CCA suming 56 tests; see “Participants and Methods” and “Statistical Analysis”). In the entire longevity sample (1,384 LLI and 945 controls), none of the tested SNPs showed a

With the applied approach, we are likely to have captured all common variation present in the analyzed samples for the CYP2C gene region. Acknowledging that the selected markers might be insufficient to tag the genetic variation comprehensively, we cannot rule out the presence of rare polymorphisms that could influence longevity. However, with the consideration of haplotype differences, if present,

the effect of rare variants should be statistically detectable as these effects ought to be carried by one of the common background haplotypes (59). Furthermore, common variants can act as significant modifiers of the effects of rare variants (60). Thus, rare variants that are functionally relevant are often identified by common variant associations (61–64). Altogether, it seems unlikely that we have missed such rare variant effects in our comprehensive approach. The possi- bility that the negative association finding is due to popula- tion stratification in our samples is also rather improbable because the validity and efficacy of our large and well-char- acterized study population for genetic longevity research have already been shown with the identification and valida- tion of previous association findings (26,32–34). Overall, our results suggest that there is no noteworthy influence of sequence variation in the CYP2C genes on human longevity in Germans.
