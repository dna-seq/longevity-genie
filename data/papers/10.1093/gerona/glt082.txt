Evidence from model organisms suggests that the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway has an important, evolutionarily con- served influence over rate of aging and thus longevity. In humans, the FOXO3 gene is the only widely replicated insulin/ IGF-1 signaling pathway gene associated with longevity across multiple populations. Therefore, we conducted a nested case–control study of other insulin/IGF-1 signaling genes and longevity, utilizing a large, homogeneous, long-lived popu- lation of American men of Japanese ancestry, well characterized for aging phenotypes. Genotyping was performed of single nucleotide polymorphisms, tagging most of the genetic variation across several genes in the insulin/IGF-1 signal- ing pathway or related gene networks that may be influenced by FOXO3, namely, ATF4, CBL, CDKN2, EXO1, and JUN. Two initial, marginal associations with longevity did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons, nor were they correlated with aging-related phenotypes.

H ErITABILITy of extreme longevity is estimated as 0.33 and 0.48 in male and female centenarians (1). Although centenarians are enriched for longevity single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) (2), few have been identi- fied (3,4), possibly because of small effect sizes (5).

and uncoupling protein 3 and decreases phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (12), and its neuronal expression affects Drosophila life span (13); (iii) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B , which encodes INK4A and ArF, and whose genetic locus is asso- ciated with type 2 diabetes (14–16); (iv) the DNA repair enzyme exonuclease 1 (17); (v) V-Jun avian sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homolog (Jun), a transcription factor which, in a complex with Fos (to form the activator protein-1 com- plex), affects cell growth and tumorigenesis (18).

The insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway is an example of an evolutionarily conserved biological pathway that affects aging (6,7). In humans a finding of association of genetic variation in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway gene FOXO3A with extreme old age in our cohort of American men of Japanese ancestry (8) has now been replicated con- sistently in other populations for both sexes.

Methods

Here we report our findings from an exploratory study of SNPs in other evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF-1 sign- aling pathway genes chosen on the basis of model organism data and human studies, namely, those encoding (i) activat- ing transcription factor 4, which activates stress-resistance genes (9), transcription of the asparagine synthase gene (ASNS) in response to nutrient stress (10), and suppresses the cell senescence/life span determining components INK4A/ ArF (locus CDKN2A) (11); (ii) Casitas B-cell lymphoma protein, which regulates whole-body energy expenditure and insulin action by suppression of the insulin receptor

Study Population

The study used a nested case–control design and participants drawn from the HHP/HAAS population described previously (8). These were American men of Japanese ancestry recruited in Oahu in 1965–1968 at ages 45–68 years and followed with regular examinations and blood work until the present, or death. “Cases” (longevity phenotype) were defined as HHP/HAAS participants who had survived to beyond the upper 1% of the 1910 U.S. birth cohort–specific survival (minimum 95 years

of age [19]; n = 213 as of August 2007, 176 died [age of death = 97.5 ± 2.1 SD; range 95–106 years] and 37 were still alive [mean age = 98.7 ± 2.1 SD; range 97–106 years]). Controls consisted of 402 individuals from the HHP/HAAS cohort who had died near the mean for the 1910 U.S. birth cohort–specific survival for middle-aged men (77 years). To achieve a case:control ratio of approximately 1:2, we sampled the HHP/HAAS study population for controls who died up to the age of 81 years (mean age at death = 78.5 ± 1.8 SD years; range 73–81 years), consistent with the 3.5 years longer life expectancy of American men of Japanese ancestry in Hawaii (20).

Statistical Analyses

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Differences between cases and controls were evaluated by the Pearson χ2 test. The minimal detectable difference in allele frequency between cases and controls depends on the MAF among controls. For a nominal significance level of p = .05, a MAF for con- trols of 0.10 or 0.20 would require a MAF among cases of 0.155 and 0.271, respectively. Bonferroni adjustment for 15 tests requires p to be .05/15 (ie, .0033) for significance. For control MAF of 0.10 and 0.20, the minimal detectable dif- ference in MAF for cases would then be 0.176 and 0.296, respectively.

Procedures performed were in accord with institutional guidelines and were approved by the Institutional review Board of Kuakini Medical Center. Written informed con- sent was obtained from all study participants or from family representatives if participants could not provide consent.

For strength of association, odds ratios were estimated using logistic regression models from SAS (22). Linear regression models were used for continuous variables, and logistic regression models were used for categorical variables in testing for associations between genotype and aging phe- notypes, adjusting for case–control status and age at baseline.

Genotyping

For reasons of power, we included only common SNPs, that is, those having a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than or equal to 10% in the Japanese population as indicated by the JSNP database (http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) and with reference to the dbSNP/HapMap database (HapMap release 23a/phase II March 2008 on National Center for Biotechnology Information B36 assembly, dbSNP b126—http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). These included tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) plus 10 kb of 5′- and of 3′-flanking DNA for ATF1, CBL, and JUN (Table 1). The minimal coefficient of determination (r2) value at which all alleles are to be captured was set to a threshold of 0.8 for the identification of all tagSNPs. In the case of EXO1, we genotyped only a single functional SNP in the promoter, this being the only SNP associated with longevity of seven tested (21). For CDKN2B we chose a SNP implicated in β-cell function (14).

Results

Characteristics of Participants

population at the 1991–1993 examination are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The long-lived cases were older; had lower waist:hip ratio, plasma glucose, plasma insulin, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), and grip strength; had nonsignificantly lower plasma triglycerides; were bet- ter able to walk 0.8 km; had better self-rated health; and had lower prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular disease (cor- onary heart disease, stroke, and hypertension). The higher systolic blood pressure of cases reflects the rise in isolated systolic hypertension with age. There was no difference in cognitive abilities screening instrument score between cases and controls.

tem (Gentra Systems, Inc.) and quantified using PicoGreen staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). SNPs were genotyped using allelic discrimination assays. TaqMan rea- gents (purchased from Life Technologies; formerly Applied Biosystems, Inc) were used for PCr amplification under standard conditions with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymer- ase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). PCr products were detected by TaqMan assay, using a 6-FAM-labeled fluorescence reso- nance energy transfer probe for one allele and a VIC-labeled probe for the other allele, with minor groove binding quench- ers to enhance assay signal. PCr products were measured using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System.

Pathway Analysis

http://gncpro.sabiosciences.com/gncpro/gncpro.php), we were able to confirm functional connections (as defined by links to peer-reviewed publications) between proteins of all of the genes chosen (eg, upregulation, downregulation, coexpression, chemical modification, physical interaction, predicted protein interaction, predicted transcription fac- tor regulation, or other relation; Supplementary Figure 1). The analysis also provided potential candidates for future genetic studies.

Genotype data were managed through an integrated database system sample management–data processing system of proven accuracy (8). All positive controls on each genotyping plate were evaluated for consistency. Call rates for markers exceeded 98%.

Genetic Association Findings

As shown in Table 1, only SNP rs6589722 in CBL was significant (p = .015), with SNP rs17356414 in JUN being marginal (p = .082).

One-way ANOVA detected no relationship between factors associated with insulin sensitivity, a potential intermediate phenotype of longevity, and genotype. For nonnormally distributed variables, we used log transforma- tion to approximate a normal distribution. There was no association between other phenotypes and any of the SNPs in Table 1 (Supplementary Table 2). Nor was there a rela- tionship between any of the genotypes and maximum age attained in either the case or the control groups (data not shown).

variants not present in other populations, may exist that could be associated with longevity.

For the two SNPs with marginal association with lon- gevity before Bonferroni correction, no significant associa- tion was found with a range of aging-related phenotypes, common diseases or a combined phenotype representing “healthy aging.”

A limitation of our cohort was that it only included male participants. Thus, the SNPs tested could be associated with longevity or other aging-related phenotypes in female par- ticipants, as shown for the SNP in EXO1 in female, but not male, German centenarians (21). The longevity-associated allele in the EXO1 promoter, by elevating EXO1 expression, could theoretically have an effect on longevity.

Discussion

To date findings on genetic variants conferring an increase in human life span are limited (23). This reflects, in part, the difficulty of obtaining cohorts of suitable study participants who have attained extreme old age. Therefore, given suffi- cient power, any data, whether positive or negative, may be instructive in deciphering the molecular genetic etiology of human longevity. In the present nested case–control study, after correction for multiple comparisons, none of the SNPs tested were significantly associated with living to the age of 95 years or more. Due to limited resources, not all SNPs that have been discovered in each gene were tested. rather, we tested “tagging SNPs” identified by the HapMap database or, in the case of EXO1, a single functional variant, among seven of potential functional relevance to longevity (21). Thus the SNPs we selected provided maximal coverage of genetic variability across all but EXO1, taking advantage of linkage disequilibrium. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that one or more polymorphism not in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs tested, or population-specific

A major advantage of this study is that it employed a nested case–control design. This type of study design selects cases and controls from an ongoing cohort study that involves lon- gitudinally collected data. Consequently, several phenotypes of interest, such as disease prevalence, health status, and functional status, could be obtained by direct clinical exami- nation when the participants were younger, thereby elimi- nating recall bias. recall bias can decrease the reliability of findings from studies of the very old. In this study, major diseases were adjudicated by a morbidity and mortality com- mittee that used performance-based measures of physical and cognitive function to supplement self-reported information.

There are several other strengths to our study. First, the candidate genes selected for analysis were chosen a priori based on hypothesis-driven criteria. Second, not only did the study involve a nested case–control design but it had a high event rate (deaths) during a long period of follow- up. Third, the HHP/HAAS cohort is a highly homogeneous

group of individuals, and no population stratification was detected in our study participants.

Since the cases and controls had an average age differ- ence of 11 years, we cannot completely exclude the possi- bility that differences in birth cohorts were a confounding factor. This seems unlikely since there was only a 19-year difference in birth years from oldest to youngest, and suba- nalyses revealed there were no differences in education and occupation between cases and controls (data not shown). Moreover, those participants who were older at baseline were more likely to have lived to 95 years, whereas most cohort effects show health advantages for younger cohorts. In conclusion, this study has found no association of

genetic variation in ATF4, CBL, CDKN2, EXO1, and JUN with longevity in American men of Japanese ancestry study participants. Studies of these genes in other populations may be of merit.
