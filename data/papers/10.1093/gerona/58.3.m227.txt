Background. Genetic polymorphisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) have been reported to be associated with human longevity and dementia in the elderly. However, whether such putative longevity genes exert the same effects on different ethnic groups living in different environments is not well known.

Methods. We investigated the distributions of the ACE and APOE genotypes and their relations with dementia status in Korean centenarians by cross-sectional study. A total of 103 centenarians (13 men and 90 women, mean age 102.4 6 2.6 years) were included in this study. The allele frequencies of the genes were compared with those of two control groups: 7232 apparently healthy adults (4100 men and 3132 women) of mean age 48.5 6 9.6 years for the ACE genotyping, and 6435 adults (5008 men and 1427 women) of mean age 50.7 6 7.9 years for the APOE genotyping. The dementia status of the centenarians was assessed by clinical psychologist using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score.

Results. The frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the ACE and APOE genes of the centenarians were not significantly different from those of the control groups. There was a lack of association between presence of the D allele on the ACE gene and dementia status. However, the frequency of the e4 allele of the APOE gene was significantly higher in centenarians with dementia than in centenarians without definitive dementia (9.1% versus 1.5%, p , .05).

Conclusions. These results suggest that neither the ACE nor the APOE gene is significantly associated with longevity in the Korean population, but that the APOE e4 allele is still related with dementia even at age 100 and older.

for cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction (11,12), left ventricular hypertrophy (13), and coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus (14). In addition, the D allele was reported to be more frequent among Alzheimer’s disease subjects than in controls (15). It seems paradoxical that such an allele with adverse effects on major diseases is also related to survival to extreme old age.

associated diseases and attained the extreme limit of human life, are the best subjects for the genetic study of longevity. Although twin studies have suggested that the heritability of life span would be no more than 30% (1,2), genetic factors seem to play an important role in exceptional longevity (3). When the survival of siblings of centenarians was compared with the survival of siblings of a control group who were from a similar birth cohort, the relative risk of survival to older age steadily increased with age for siblings of the centenarians (4).

The e4 allele of the APOE gene is known to be associated with a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease (16). And it is also related with coronary artery disease through lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis (17,18). Previous studies demonstrated the decrease of the e4 allele frequency and the increase of the e2 allele frequency in centenarians (6,8). However, most of the studies in search of the association between genetic polymorphisms and longevity have been conducted in Caucasian populations. It is not known whether the APOE polymorphisms influence longevity differently in Korean compared with Caucasian populations (6,8,19,20). Compared with Caucasian populations, Asians are reported to carry lower frequencies of the APOE e4 allele (21,22). Given the differential environment exposures experienced by Korean centenarians, potential gene–envi- ronmental interactions would also be expected to differ from Western Caucasians.

Recently, significant genetic associations with human longevity have been found at the HLA [human leukocyte antigen] (5), ACE [angiotensin-converting enzyme] (6,7), APOE [apolipoprotein E] (6,8), and APOB [apolipoprotein B] loci (9). Among them, the association between ACE gene polymorphism and longevity is rather controversial. Sha¨chter and colleagues (6) first reported that the frequency of the D allele of the ACE gene was higher in French cen- tenarians than in the control group. However, this finding was not confirmed in a later, larger, French centenarian cohort study (10). In Asian populations, the association was only found in a certain ethnic group in China (7). Mean- while, the D allele has been associated with increased risk

Although the genetic polymorphism of the APOE has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive function in elderly people, very few studies have been per- formed in subjects aged 100 and older. In a study of 47 Japanese centenarians, no significant difference was found in the frequency of the e4 allele between Alzheimer’s dis- ease and nondemented centenarians (22).

examinations, and laboratory tests. General physical exam- ination was performed by a doctor specializing in geriatric medicine, and cognitive function was assessed by a clinical psychologist. Fasting venous blood was obtained from each subject and collected into tubes containing ethylenediamine- tetraacetic acid [EDTA]. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The APOE genotyping was done with an INNO-LiPA Apo E Kit (Innogenetics N.V., Belgium) following the manufacturer’s instruction. The ACE gene polymorphism was identified as previously described (23) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with primers flanking the polymorphic region. PCR products of the two alleles of 490 and 190 bp were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The number of alleles was estimated by a gene-counting method.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the dis- tributions of the ACE and APOE gene polymorphisms in Korean centenarians and to evaluate the association of these genes with dementia in such extreme old age.

Subjects

A total of 103 centenarians (13 men and 90 women) were included in this study. They ranged in age from 100 to 115 years. The mean age 6 standard deviation (SD) was 102.4 6 2.6 years. The Korean Centenarian Study was begun in December 1999. Persons born in 1900 or earlier were identified from the national registry of centenarians of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Fifty-eight centenarians were living in the Seoul metropolitan area and 11, 22, and 12 centenarians were recruited from Kyungsang, Chunra, and Cheju provinces, respectively. Our medical team obtained consent from each subject or close relatives and visited their homes. The ACE and APOE genotype of the control group was drawn from the data of individuals who visited the Health Promotion Center at Samsung Medical Center for periodic health examination. The control population for the ACE genotyping was 7232 apparently healthy adults, of mean age 48.5 6 9.6 years and ranged from age 20 to 85 years. There were 4100 men (mean age 48.6 6 9.6 years, range 23–81 years) and 3132 women (mean age 48.3 6 9.7 years, range 20–85 years). The control population for the APOE genotyping was 6435 apparently healthy adults, of mean age 50.7 6 7.9 years and age range from 30 to 79 years. There were 5008 men (mean age 50.6 6 7.9 years, age range 30–79 years) and 1427 women (mean age 51.1 6 8.1 years, age range 30–78 years).

Dementia status was appropriately assessed in 89 cen- tenarians (men 11, women 78) with the following Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores (24): 0, no dementia; 0.5, dementia suspected; 1, mild dementia; 2, moderate dementia; and 3, severe dementia. Subjects were divided into two groups according to their dementia status. A CDR score of 0 or 0.5 was considered to indicate the absence of defini- tive dementia, while a score of 1, 2, or 3, the presence of dementia (25).

To compare the difference in frequency between the groups, the chi-square test was performed. A p value of less than .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. All results are expressed as mean 6 SD. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS (Statistical Application System, Version 6.10; SAS, Inc., Cary, NC).

Notes: Dementia status was assessed with clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores: 0, no dementia; .5, dementia suspected; 1, mild dementia; 2, moderate dementia; and 3, severe dementia. Subjects were divided into two groups ac- cording to their dementia status. A CDR score of 0 or .5 indicated the ab- sence of definitive dementia, while a score of 1, 2, or 3 indicated the presence of dementia.

were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no sig- nificant difference between the two groups in the overall distribution of the genotypes and alleles for the ACE gene. The frequencies of the e2 allele of the APOE gene in the centenarians and the control group were 6.3% and 6.4%, respectively. The frequencies of the e4 allele were 6.8% and 9.2%, respectively, which were not significantly different. Figure 1 presents the distribution of three alleles of the APOE gene according to the decade of subject age from the combined population of the control group and centenarians. Although it was not statistically significant, the frequency of the e4 allele slightly decreased after the eighth decade and tended to be lower in the centenarians. The e2 allele apparently did not indicate any age-dependent change in their proportion.

dementia status was not determined by standardized Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) or National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) criteria, but only by CDR scores. CDR, an instrument to assess the severity of dementia symptoms, is not an especially sensitive measure of cognitive function, particularly in very old and functionally dependent persons. However, there are few reports on the results of cognitive function tests in centenarians, so standardized protocols or normative data are not available for this specific group. As conventional cognitive assessment is often complicated by sensory impairment and medical illness (26), a simple CDR score might be useful in this setting to evaluate the dementia status in frail centenarians.

Although French and Chinese centenarian studies have presented an association between the ACE gene and longevity, the association has not been found in our Korean centenarians. The distribution of ACE genotypes in Korean people is different from that in the Western population (12,27), but similar to that in the Chinese and Japanese (7,28). Thus the discrepancy could not be explained merely by the difference of the allele proportions between ethnic groups.

The prevalence of dementia in centenarian subjects was 61.8% (55/89) by CDR criteria (a CDR score of 1, 2, or 3 indicating the presence of dementia). Table 3 shows the number and dementia status of the subjects according to the CDR score. The allele frequencies of the ACE and APOE genes were compared between centenarians without de- finitive dementia and those with dementia (Tables 4 and 5). The frequency of the D allele of the ACE gene in the centenarians with dementia was not significantly different from that in the centenarians without definitive dementia (37.3 % versus 45.6 %, p . .05). The frequency of the e4 allele of APOE was significantly higher in centenarians with dementia than in those without definitive dementia (9.1% versus 1.5%, p , .05). However, it is a potential limitation of the analysis that this comparison was based on a single centenarian subject with APOE e4 and without definitive dementia.

Farrer and colleagues (15) reported that the D allele was more frequent among Alzheimer’s disease subjects aged 66 to 70 than in controls. However, in a Japanese study, the frequency of II genotypes of ACE was 1.4 times higher in Alzheimer’s disease subjects than in controls, while that of DD genotypes was only 0.4 times as high (29). In our study, there was no significant association between ACE poly- morphism and dementia status in Korean centenarians. It seems that the ACE gene confers such weak effects on the cardiovascular system, cognitive function, or longevity that they are easily offset by other factors. Therefore, the genetic effects of ACE seem to be revealed only in a very homo- geneous group with the same genetic and environmental factors. Although we could not find a significant associa- tion between ACE polymorphism and the dementia status of centenarians, the possibility of a type II error, i.e., the existing association was not found because of insufficient

D ISCUSSION

This is the first report on Korean centenarians with regard to genetic polymorphisms and dementia. The subjects were recruited nationwide from various urban and rural areas. As expected in such a survey on the very old, there is a potential for selection bias, as healthier subjects are more likely to participate in the study. Another limitation may be that

power, remains. Further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm our results.

Many studies have documented the association of APOE polymorphisms with blood lipid levels and with the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. It was reported that the frequency of the e4 allele of APOE decreases with advancing age (19,30) and that of the e2 allele contrarily increases in the elderly and centenarians (6,20). The elimination of the e4 allele at an earlier age and its decreased frequency in old people can be explained by the fact that the e4 allele is associated with coronary heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease (31,32). Nevertheless a significant change of allele frequency with advancing age was not confirmed in this study of a Korean population. One reason may be that Koreans have lower frequencies of e2 and e4 alleles than Western people (18,33). Another explanation might be the smaller proportion of coronary heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease as causes of mortality in Korean elderly. Whereas coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death (usually more than 20%) after middle age in Western countries, in Korea it causes only 4.5% of deaths (34), partly because of lower fat intake and a lower level of serum cholesterol. Malignancies and cerebrovascular accidents contribute more to mortality in Korea. If the e4 allele increases the risk of mortality in association with hypercho- lesterolemia and coronary heart disease, the adverse impact of the allele would be much less significant in a population with low serum cholesterol and less coronary heart disease.

still exerts an unfavorable effect on cognitive function in extremely old age. Since cognitive dysfunction is very closely related with activities of daily living, especially in the oldest old, it may be possible that the e4 allele is a risk factor for general functional decline at the final stage of human life.

In this study, although we could not define Alzheimer’s disease in our demented subjects, the majority of them is expected to be included within the category of Alzheimer’s disease. Asada and colleagues (22) found that 75.8% (25/33) of demented centenarians were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The distribution of APOE alleles in Korean late-onset Alzheimer’s disease patients (mean age of onset 73.1 6 5.8 years) was previously reported. The frequencies of the e2, e3, and e4 alleles were 2.8%, 63.5%, and 33.7%, respectively (35). Compared with the 33.7% frequency of the e4 allele in elderly Alzheimer’s disease cases, the absolute percentage of the e4 allele (9.1%) in demented centenarians is very small. This finding supports the contention of Asada and colleagues (22) that the fre- quency of the e4 allele in Alzheimer’s disease subjects de- creases with age.

onset Alzheimer’s disease, the prevalence of which increases markedly in the very old. Therefore, the influence of the e4 allele on Alzheimer’s disease might increase with advancing age. Furthermore, APOE alleles have a significant impact on the age of onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, it is plausible that for the population with a relatively short life span, the e4 allele could have a reduced chance to lead to Alzheimer’s disease and hence contribute less to this disease mortality. The average life expectancy for the Korean popu- lation was 62 in 1971, 66 in 1981, and 71 in 1991; about 5–10 years shorter than that for developed countries.

Although the overall distribution of the APOE allele in Korean centenarians was not statistically different from that in the control population, it was noticed that the frequency of the e4 allele gradually decreased after the eighth decade and tended to be lower in the centenarians. However, the e2 allele did not show any age-dependent change in its proportion (Figure 1). This finding suggests that the e4 allele may have a noticeable effect on survival disadvantage, as previously reported from Western countries. Therefore, the important determinant for longevity of Korean people may be the absence of the e4 allele rather than the presence of the e2 allele. This hypothesis is concordant with a previous report by Gerdes and colleagues (32).

We found that the frequency of the e4 allele was signi- ficantly higher in demented centenarians than in nonde- mented centenarians. This finding suggests that the e4 allele

In summary, the present Korean centenarian study pro- duced rather different results about the effect of ACE and APOE polymorphisms on human longevity and dementia. It is not surprising that Asian people with different genetic and environmental backgrounds show different results from Westerners in research on multifactorial phenomena. Our data disproved the association of the D allele of the ACE gene with longevity and dementia. One possible explanation may be that the effect of the allele is sufficiently mild as to be buffered by environmental and other genetic factors. Nevertheless the limitation of the study due to small sample size needs to be overcome in future research for a definitive conclusion to be made. The genetic polymorphism of APOE was not significantly different between the centenarians and control population. However, e4 allele frequency showed a tendency to decrease at extremely old age. It was found that the unfavorable effect of the e4 allele on dementia status is still remarkable among centenarians.
