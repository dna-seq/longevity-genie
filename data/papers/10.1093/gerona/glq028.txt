Background. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may yield insights into longevity.

Methods. We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS in Caucasians from four prospective cohort studies: the Age, Gene/ Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study participating in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Con- sortium. Longevity was defined as survival to age 90 years or older (n = 1,836); the comparison group comprised cohort members who died between the ages of 55 and 80 years (n = 1,955). In a second discovery stage, additional genotyping was conducted in the Leiden Longevity Study cohort and the Danish 1905 cohort.

Results. There were 273 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with p < .0001, but none reached the prespecified significance level of 5 × 10−8. Of the most significant SNPs, 24 were independent signals, and 16 of these SNPs were successfully genotyped in the second discovery stage, with one association for rs9664222, reaching 6.77 × 10−7 for the combined meta-analysis of CHARGE and the stage 2 cohorts. The SNP lies in a region near MINPP1 (chro- mosome 10), a well-conserved gene involved in regulation of cellular proliferation. The minor allele was associated with lower odds of survival past age 90 (odds ratio = 0.82). Associations of interest in a homologue of the longevity assurance gene (LASS3) and PAPPA2 were not strengthened in the second stage.

Conclusion. Survival studies of larger size or more extreme or specific phenotypes may support or refine these initial

Two previous studies have used whole-genome screening to identify genetic variants associated with longevity (20,21). In a linkage analysis, the earliest report (20) identi- fied a locus on chromosome 4 that has not been replicated. A recent report from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (22) identified modest associations between longevity (or age at death) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near important candidate genes, including FOXO1A, GAPDH, KL, LEPR, PON1, PSEN1, SOD2, and WRN, but none of the associations achieved conventional levels of sta- tistical significance; the sample size was modest, and the genotyping platform did not cover the genome well by cur- rent standards. The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has successfully led to the discovery of novel genetic variants that have strong evidence for replica- tion and that are outside of traditional candidate gene re- gions for several common diseases (23–29). The detection of novel genetic variants associated with longevity holds the promise to provide important insights to biologic pathways in the aging process and thus the potential to develop inno- vative strategies to promote a long and healthy life.

wide are an unprecedented phenomenon with significant health and social impact. Although environmental factors have led to an increase in life span, there is ample evidence that genetic factors are involved in extreme longevity both in humans (1–7) and in other organisms (8). The protective genetic factors that lead to longevity are likely to involve fundamental processes of aging that may be different from those associated with early mortality or premature onset of age-related diseases in younger individuals. The mecha- nisms of aging in humans are far from understood, but avail- able evidence suggests that several pathways—inflammation, oxidative stress and stress responses, cellular senescence, DNA damage and repair, and the growth hormone or insulin- like growth factor and insulin (GH, IGF, INS) axis—may play key roles (9–12). Model organisms suggest that inhibit- ing the GH, IGF, or INS axis, which is involved in regulat- ing cell proliferation, cell death, wound repair, and metabolism, may promote longevity by reducing oxidative stress and slowing the rate of cell replication and the accu- mulation of somatic-cell DNA mutations (13). There is also evidence for other important pathways such as the heat- shock proteins and heat-shock factors that are highly con- served across species and play a role in prolongevity transcription pathways. Clinical and epidemiological inves- tigations, including candidate gene studies, have suggested that inflammation pathways may affect life span and risk of age-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors (14–19). A combination of multiple genetic variants may be required for an individual to achieve excep-

We conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS findings for lon- gevity within an international consortium of four longitudi- nal community-based cohort studies that followed adults over many years. Longevity was defined as survival to age 90 years or older, and a comparison group was drawn from each cohort. Furthermore, we identified two independent cohorts of long-lived individuals, the Leiden Longevity Study cohort and the Danish 1905 cohort, to evaluate initial findings for the strongest allelic associations for longevity in a second discovery stage.

Longevity and Comparison Group Definitions

Methods

In the present study, achievement of longevity was de- fined as reaching age 90 years or older, regardless of whether the participants were still living or had since died. Geno- typed participants from these studies who died between the ages of 55 and 80 years were used as the comparison group. The comparison group was limited to deceased participants to ensure that no one in the comparison group could subse- quently achieve longevity. The minimum age at death was set to match the minimum age at enrollment in the RS to promote age comparability of the comparison group across the four cohorts. The maximal age at death in the compari- son group was set arbitrarily at age 80 years to include the majority of deaths, to maximize the overlap between birth cohorts, and to exclude those persons who survived far be- yond average life expectancy for their respective birth co- hort, that is persons who nearly reached longevity. Because of the timing of recruitment, DNA collection, and death, there was only partial overlap of the birth cohorts included in the comparison groups and the group of persons achiev- ing longevity. Only Caucasian participants were included. Across the four studies, there were 1,836 persons who achieved longevity (144 from AGES-Reykjavik, 557 from CHS, 362 from FHS, and 773 from the RS), and the com- parison group had 1,955 participants (122, 544, 355, and 934 participants from the AGES-Reykjavik, CHS, FHS, and RS, respectively). To facilitate comparison of results across studies, we imputed to 2.5 million SNPs using the HapMap Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain European Ancestry–genotyped samples as a reference. The effective sample size for all but one of the top SNPs was more than 80% of the full sample size of 3,791, indicating that the SNPs that were not directly genotyped were imputed well in most studies.

The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium was convened to pro- mote the discovery of new genomic loci involved in multiple complex traits in population-based follow-up studies using genome-wide association analysis (30). This meta-analysis used data from the CHARGE Consortium, which includes the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AG- ES-Reykjavik) (31), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (32), FHS (33–36), and the Rotterdam Study (RS) (37).

The AGES-Reykjavik was funded by the National Insti- tute on Aging (NIA) and was designed to examine genetic susceptibility and environmental interactions as risk factors for disease and disability in old age. Detailed phenotyping of the cardiovascular, neurocognitive, musculoskeletal, and body composition and metabolism was conducted in 5,764 men and women enrolled in 2002–2006 who were sampled from the 11,549 survivors of the AGES-Reykjavik of 30,000 men and women sampled from the 1907–1935 birth cohort (31). The CHS is a National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) contract-funded cohort study designed to evaluate risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in older adults (32). Participants (n = 5,201) were recruited in 1989–1990, with an additional 687 minorities recruited in 1992–1993. The FHS is an NHLBI contract-funded co- hort study initiated in 1948 to study determinants of CVD and other major illnesses. The original cohort comprised 5,209 men and women aged 28–62 years at enrollment who have undergone routine biennial examinations (33,34). In 1971, 5,124 offspring of the original cohort participants and offspring spouses, aged 5–70 years, were enrolled into the Framingham Offspring Study. Offspring participants have been examined approximately every 4–8 years (35,36). In the 1990s, DNA was obtained for genetic studies from sur- viving original cohort and offspring participants. The RS was planned and designed in the early 1990s as a longitudi- nal study investigating the incidence and progression of dis- eases in the elderly participants. From 1991 to 1995, all inhabitants of Ommoord, a district of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, who were aged 55 years or older, were invited to participate in this study (38). Of 10,275 eligible individu- als, 7,983 agreed to participate (78%). The participants in the CHARGE studies are Caucasian by self-report. In each CHARGE study, population structure was assessed using principal components analysis, and outliers were removed. Any remaining within-study structure was adjusted for us- ing appropriate methods (39). The details of each participat- ing cohort study’s genotyping platform, imputation algorithm, and quality control procedures used by each study are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Each study was approved by the respective Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided consent.

Second Discovery Stage Genotyping

Among the top 24 independent regions with the strongest associations for longevity in the four-study meta-analysis (p < 10−4), we selected the 22 SNPs that had been tested in all four CHARGE cohorts in two additional Caucasian cohorts: the Leiden Longevity Study cohort and the Danish 1905 cohort. We excluded the two SNPs that could not be geno- typed or imputed in all four CHARGE cohorts. Of the 22 SNPs selected for genotyping, 2 could not be genotyped and 4 did not pass quality control procedures; thus, 16 SNPs were analyzed in the second stage.

In the “Leiden Longevity Study” (7,40), a total of 950 long-lived proband siblings (mean age 94 years, range 89– 104 years), 1,750 offspring (mean age 61 years, range 39– 81 years), and 758 partners of offspring (mean age 60 years, range 36–79 years) were included. The additional genotyp- ing of selected SNPs was undertaken in all 950 long-lived probands, and these were compared with the 744 partners of their offspring and an additional 680 blood bank donors

(60% men, mean age 31 years, range 18–40 years). All long-lived individuals and the comparison groups were from the Leiden area in the Netherlands and of European ancestry.

were meta-analyzed. The study-specific inflation factors (l ) were computed using the set of chi-square statistics GC used for the meta-analysis for each study. The inflation fac- tor is computed as the median of all chi-square statistics divided by the expected median of the statistics (approxi- mately 0.456) for a chi-square distribution with 1 df. We calculated a meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) for each SNP using a fixed-effects model that combined logistic regres- sion parameters and standard errors across the studies using inverse variance weights. The meta-analysis OR represents the increase in log-odds of surviving to age 90 years or older versus dying between ages 55 and 80 years for each addi- tional copy of the minor allele of the SNP. SNP associations were considered to be significant on a genome-wide level at p < 5 × 10−8. The 16 SNPs in the second discovery phase effort were analyzed in the two study samples using an ad- ditive model. The results were added to the previous meta- analysis using a fixed-effects model as described earlier. Finally, using the top 24 results, we conducted a pathway analysis with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).

Participants in the “Danish 1905 Cohort Survey” are from the Danish 1905 birth cohort ascertained in 1998 when they were aged 92–93 years (41). Of the 3,600 participants alive from that cohort, 2,262 participants enrolled in the study. Participants underwent a home-based interview on health and lifestyle parameters, physical and cognitive tests, and collection of biologic material. The current genetic study comprises a total of 1,644 participants from this survey, mean age 93 years (range 92–93 years), 28% men. A com- parison group included 2,007 Caucasians who were twins (one twin per pair) collected from all over Denmark, with a mean age of 57 years (range 46–68 years), 45% men.

Second Discovery Stage Genotyping Methods

an iPLEX genotyping assay developed for use with the MassARRAY platform (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, CA) (42). The iPLEX genotyping assay is based on mass spec- trometry and enables genotyping of 25–36 custom SNPs on a sample in a single reaction. For the purposes of quality control, the system first automatically calls the genotypes and then generates cluster plots for all SNPs that are in- spected individually by experienced technicians who check whether the plots show clear separation of the genotype clusters. There were two SNPs that did not pass quality con- trol and two SNPs where no heterozygotes could not be de- tected; thus, lack of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was the quality control. Negative controls were included in the genotyping procedure (8 per 384-well plate), and impor- tantly, 4% of samples were genotyped twice to confirm re- producibility (reproducibility was ≥99.7%).

Results

Table 1 provides the characteristics of the persons achiev- ing longevity and the comparison group in each of the four CHARGE discovery cohorts at the time of DNA collection. In line with the design of the study, persons achieving lon- gevity were 10–20 years older than participants in the com- parison group at baseline and were more likely to be women. Between 45% and 83% of those achieving longevity were still alive at the time that longevity status was ascertained. Among those who had died, the distributions of causes of death differed between those achieving longevity and the comparison group. Whereas 6%–12% of those achieving longevity died of cancer, more than 30% of the comparison group had death attributed to cancer. The prevalence of dia- betes and a history of ever smoking were higher in the com- parison group than in persons achieving longevity. The baseline prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factor lev- els showed substantial overlap between the two groups.

Statistical Analysis

Using logistic regression, each imputed and observed HapMap SNP was tested for association with the longevity outcome using an additive genetic model adjusting for sex. The mean dosage of one of the alleles (a value between 0 and 2) was the predictor for imputed SNPs. The CHS addi- tionally adjusted for field study site in the regression model, and the FHS used generalized estimating equations to ac- count for familial correlations. We used the ratio of observed to expected variance in the imputed SNP genotype counts as a quality control metric for imputed SNPs (43). This ra- tio, multiplied by the sample size, is an estimate of the ef- fective sample size. In the imputation software MaCH, this ratio is called r2 as it is an estimate of the allelic correlation between the imputed genotypes and the true genotypes for the SNP. A total of 2,287,520 SNPs that had average minor allele frequency greater than 0.01 and were genotyped or imputed in all studies with variance ratio greater than 0.1

The genomic control inflation factor lambda (l ) for GC each cohort was less than 1.05 (45). After meta-analysis, overall inflation of the meta-analysis p values was minor (l = 1.034; Figure 1). None of the SNP–longevity asso- GC ciations achieved the prespecified level of genome-wide significance of p < 5 × 10−8 (Figures 1 and 2). There were 273 SNP associations with meta-analysis p < 10−4, and of these, 7 SNP associations had p < 10−5 (Supplementary Table 2). Under the null hypothesis that there are no asso- ciations in the genome, we would expect 0.0001 × ~2.3 mil- lion = ~230 hits. Table 2 shows the top 24 independent SNPs associated with longevity along with the number of supporting SNPs (additional SNPs with linkage disequilib- rium r2 > .80 and p < 10−4). Thus, for example, there were

Discussion

The CHARGE Consortium collaboration allowed us to conduct a meta-analysis of GWAS for longevity in a sample of long-lived individuals and a corresponding comparison group derived from the same longitudinal community-based cohort studies. Although none of the SNP associations for longevity in the first discovery phase achieved prespecified level of genome-wide significance, a polymorphism associ- ated with the MINPP1 genes was among the strongest as- sociations observed in our sample, with effect sizes that were similar within the four cohorts. The finding related to the MINPP1 gene was strengthened after including two ad- ditional cohorts in a second discovery phase but did not reach genome-wide significance. Among the top 10 associa- tions in the initial meta-analysis, additional SNP associa- tions of potential interest in longevity include SNPs in or near LASS3, ACCN1, IL20RB, and PAPPA2. These SNPs

This SNP, rs9664222, is ~25 kb from the MINPP1 gene (Figure 4). In the CHARGE analysis, the minor allele was associated with a lower odds of survival past age 90 (OR = 0.77). The Leiden study yielded a similar effect estimate (OR = 0.76, p = .0014), whereas the Danish study showed a nonsignificant trend in the same direction

the likelihood that longevity is a complex process, in that there were no variants with large effects, supporting the hypothesis that there may be many genes with small effects that contribute to longevity.

are near genes that have not previously been reported to be associated with longevity in human populations but are in- teresting because these genes are conserved in basic bio- logic pathways.

The MINPP1 gene codes multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatases, which are compartmentalized to the endo- plasmic reticulum lumen. MINPP1-deficient mice have no obvious defects, though targeted deletion in vitro is associ- ated with slowed cellular proliferation (46). There is no evi- dence that this SNP is functional; furthermore, its distance from the gene shows that it is not in strong linkage disequi- librium with SNPs in MINPP1 (47). However, it is well known that important regulatory elements are found outside of genes. This SNP is within 50 kb of two copy number variants. The finding of an SNP near a gene regulating pro- liferation is intriguing because of the higher rate of cancer death in the comparison group.

The strengths of this study include the community-based prospective design and the long-term follow-up of these co- horts. In all cases, vital status was confirmed using death certificates and hospital records. Another strength was our ability to use controls that were equally well characterized and were drawn from within the same cohorts. The number of long-lived individuals reported here is very large relative to other studies in the literature, allowing greater ability to identify SNPs with small effects. The cohorts were rela- tively homogeneous with respect to ancestry, limited to Caucasians of European decent. Our top associations were homogeneous across cohorts. Screening for latent popula- tion substructure also supported ethnic homogeneity. Thus, the findings reported are less likely to be due to population stratification.

The initial finding in the LASS3 gene region was of inter- est because of the historical association of its homologue with longevity in yeast (46). The LASS gene family contains a group of highly conserved genes that are found in all eu- karyotic species. LASS isoforms are mammalian homo- logues of the yeast longevity assurance gene 1, which encodes a protein that regulates life span (48). The strongest association was noted for rs8029244; this SNP is in the in- tronic enhancer region of the LASS3 gene. LASS3 is a mem- ber of the ceramide synthase family, which is important in sphingolipid metabolism, cell differentiation, cell cycling, and apoptosis (46). LASS3 may be involved in sphingolipid synthesis or its regulation (49).

There are important aspects of the study that need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. The differences in causes of death in the longevous individuals versus the comparison groups are expected as death from cancer tends to occur earlier in life than death from heart disease or de- mentia. Many of the long-lived people are still alive and we do not yet know what their ultimate cause of death will be, but it is likely that cancer will be underrepresented among persons achieving longevity. Power remains a limitation. Thus, future GWAS aiming to identify variants for this phe- notype will have to consider small effect sizes and target a sample size larger than our nearly 2,000 long-lived persons. DNA collection in cohort studies is a recent enough phe- nomenon that relatively few cohort members who had DNA collected have had the opportunity to survive to age 90 years. Continuous study of these and other similarly designed cohorts will allow us to extend this study to larger numbers and to older ages.

IL20RB, interleukin 20 receptor beta IL-20, plays a role in skin inflammation and the development of hematopoi- etic cells (50) and is of interest because of the strong asso- ciations of inflammation with the aging process (51). IL-20 is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent inflammatory, angio- genic, and chemoattractive characteristics and is involved in inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, atherosclero- sis, and rheumatoid arthritis (50). The ACCN1 gene en- codes amiloride-sensitive sodium channels with two hydrophobic transmembrane regions and a large extracel- lular loop, which has many cysteine residues with con- served spacing (52,53). The member encoded by this gene may play a role in neurotransmission. ACCN1 was found to be associated with multiple sclerosis (54). Pregnancy-asso- ciated plasma protein A2 (PAPPA2) is a metalloproteinase regulating local insulin-like growth factor pathway action (55). Genetic deletion extends life span in the mouse by 30%–40% (56) and is characterized by delay in thymic in- volution (57) and low rates of tumor incidence (56). Al- though the associations reported here did not reach the a priori specified level of significance, the findings are im- portant to report so that they can be replicated in studies without whole-genome genotyping and compared with fu- ture studies, such as in centenarian studies and family stud- ies of longevity. Effect size estimates noted here support

for birth cohort, but the overlap between birth year of the comparison group and of the long-lived participants was limited. Further follow-up of these cohorts is needed to in- crease our ability to examine potential birth cohort effects. The study design of the cohorts examined in the second stage was different from the initial four-study CHARGE meta-analysis in that the comparison groups were derived from younger participants, living and deceased, who were not from the same cohort as the individuals achieving lon- gevity. Certainly, there are important environmental factors that would be necessary for the fulfillment of the genetic potential for longevity. Heterogeneity in environmental ex- posures and gene–environment interactions require further study. Finally, these results cannot be extended to popula- tions of other ancestry.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis of GWAS data for longevity from four large cohorts and two additional

cohorts has implicated several genes involved in conserved basic mechanisms of cellular function. Analysis of more extreme survival phenotypes such as centenarians, addi- tional follow-up to increase sample size in these cohorts for this phenotype, or evaluation of more specific phenotypes such as disease-free survival may support and refine these initial findings.
