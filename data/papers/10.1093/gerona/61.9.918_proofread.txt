Introduction:
The article aims to investigate the association between sex and age with Apolipoprotein E (apoE) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) genotypes in healthy aging and longevity among a population-based sample of individuals living in Southern Italy.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 1710 individuals were included in the study, 1344 were healthy Caucasians, and 64 were centenarians. The ACE genotypes were identified using previously described methods. The observed genotype frequencies were compared with Hardy-Weinberg frequencies using Arlequin Software. Relative allele frequencies were estimated by the gene counting method, and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) expressing variances of the estimated allele frequencies were also calculated.

Results:
Compared to participants younger than 60 years, a significantly higher frequency of the apoE/e2 was observed in men aged 60-90 years (p<.001) and in centenarians (p<.001). Logistic regression analysis confirmed this outcome in both participants aged 60-90 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.897; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.227-2.931) and centenarians (OR 3.263; 95% CI, 1.860-5.722). A further significant association of ACE/D allele and age was observed in centenarians (OR 2.135; 95% CI, 1.253-3.636). No relationship between apoE and ACE polymorphism was found.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the findings suggest a role of sex in the association of apoE and ACE gene polymorphisms with healthy aging and longevity.Other chronic neurological diseases or psychiatric syndromes with cognitive impairment (16), and (c) no cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy, or end-stage renal disease, and no severe functional limitations. We considered genotypes according to the presence of at least one allele. For the ApoE polymorphism, we reported e2 (e2/) and e4 (e4/) carriers. e2 carriers were defined as those participants showing at least one e2 allele, that is, having an e2/e2, an e2/e3, or an e2/e4 genotype. Similarly, e4 carriers were defined as those participants showing at least one e4 allele, that is, having an e4/e2, an e4/e3, or an e4/e4 genotype. For ACE polymorphism, we reported D (D/) and I (I/) carriers. D carriers were defined as those participants showing at least one D allele, that is, having a D/D or a D/I genotype. Similarly, I carriers were those participants showing at least one I allele, that is, having an I/I or an I/D genotype.

ApoE and ACE Genotyping

Genomic DNA was manually purified from 4 mL of frozen blood samples by organic protein extraction and ethanol precipitation according to standard methods (17). The ApoE and ACE genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and agarose gel electrophoresis as follows.

Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test were used to compare genotype and estimated allele frequencies. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to verify the associations between ApoE and ACE alleles with age and sex, as well as to verify interactions between ApoE and ACE alleles. All statistical analyses were made with SPSS statistical software (version 10.1.3; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A value of p < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Briefly, the two transitions C3937 ! T (Arg112 ! Cys) and C4075 ! T (Arg158 ! Cys) resulting in the ApoE polymorphism, that is, the two single nucleotide polymorphisms rs429358 and rs7412, abolished two HhaI restriction sites (GCGC!GTGC), corresponding to codons 112 and 158 of the protein. We used the forward primer described by Houlston and colleagues (18) (TCC AAG GAG CTG CAG GCG GCG CA) and a reverse primer modified from Emi and colleagues (19) (CCC TCG CGG GCC CCG GCC TGG TAC AC). Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). A total of 100 ng of genomic DNA was amplified on an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Amplification conditions were 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles at 96°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds. Reaction buffer included 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Platinum Taq; Invitrogen Corporation), 10 pmol of each primer, 100 μM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 1 mM MgCl2.

RESULTS

The overall study population of 1344 participants was divided into four groups according to age, as follows: Group 1 (n = 292, 21.73%), participants aged ≤30 years (range from 22 to 30 years of age, mean age 27.29 ± 2.10 years); Group 2 (n = 629, 46.80%), participants aged from 31 to 44 years (mean age 36.76 ± 3.94 years); Group 3 (n = 270, 20.09%), participants aged from 45 to 59 years (mean age 50.44 ± 4.17 years); and Group 4 (n = 153, 11.38%), participants aged from 60 to 90 years (mean age 70.71 ± 7.51 years). This distribution reflected that of the healthy population living in the Apulia region as reported by the ISTAT (Istituto Italiano di Statistica) Report 2002 (25).

Centenarians (p = .792). However, after dividing the participants according to sex, a significant difference in e2 frequency was found in men aged ≥60 years compared to men less than 60 years of age, that is, Group 4 versus Groups 1–3 (22.89% vs. 9.63%, p < .001), Group 4 versus Group 3 (22.89(Table 1), a significantly higher frequency of the e2 allele was found in Group 4, which included participants aged from 60 to 90 years, compared to participants younger than 60 years in Groups 1, 2, and 3 (19.61% vs. 10.41%, p < .001). This finding was mainly due to a higher prevalence of the e2 allele in Group 4 than in Group 3 (19.61% vs. 9.26%, p < .002) and Group 2 (19.61% vs. 9.38%, p < .001). No significant difference in the frequency of the e2 allele was found between Group 4 and centenarians (19.61% vs. 29.69%, p = .105). None of the centenarians showed genotypes e2/e2, e2/e4, or e4/e4. In a linear model, no association was found between apoE genotypes and age. The ACE genotype frequencies of the total participant group of 1344 did not significantly differ from the expected Hardy-Weinberg frequencies (p = .299): estimated allele frequencies were I = 0.349 (95% CI, 0.331-0.367) and D = 0.651 (95% CI, 0.633-0.669). Similarly, ACE genotype frequencies in centenarians did not differ significantly from the expected Hardy-Weinberg frequencies (p = .999): expected allele frequencies were I = 0.313 and D = 0.688.

In Table 3, no significant differences were observed in the frequency of D participants in the oldest age group compared to participants less than 60 years of age, that is, Groups 1-3 (88.89% vs. 86.99%, p = .507), Group 3 (88.89% vs. 87.41%, p = .653), and Group 2 (88.89% vs. 86.96%, p = .521). Furthermore, no difference was found in the frequency of D participants in the oldest age group compared to centenarians (88.89% vs. 90.63%, p = .705). In a linear model, no association was found between ACE alleles and age.

DISCUSSION:

This study investigated the role of sex in apoE and ACE polymorphism and their association with healthy aging and longevity in two genetically homogeneous groups of Caucasians who lived in southern Italy, that is, a cohort of healthy participants and a group of centenarians. We found a significantly higher prevalence of the e2 allele in participants older than 60 years and in centenarians than in younger participants. These findings suggest a role of the e2 allele in healthy aging and longevity, and confirm previous studies reporting a significant increase in the e2 allele frequency with advancing age, including centenarians.

In a sex-genotype analysis, no significant differences were found in the total participant group or in centenarians. As expected, after dividing participants according to sex, no differences in the distribution of ACE alleles among the age groups were found. Logistic regression analysis (Table 4) confirmed the lack of a significant association between the D allele and age. After adjustment for sex, however, a significant association between the D allele and age was observed in the oldest age group (crude OR = 1.177; 95% CI, 0.693-2.001; sex-adjusted OR = 0.453; 95% CI, 0.453-0.897) and centenarians (crude OR = 1.419; 95% CI, 0.603-3.338; sex-adjusted OR = 2.135; 95% CI, 2.135-3.636).

An association of the e2 allele with aging may be explained by two hypotheses. First, the progressively increased frequency of the e2 allele with aging may have been a consequence of the disappearance in our selected healthy participants of the e4 allele, which is reported to be linked to a higher risk of age-related diseases and mortality. Notably, heterosis was observed when ACE genotypes were classified according to sex. In fact, a significant association of both I and D alleles was shown in Group 1-3 (sex-adjusted OR values = 1.581; 95% CI, 1.211-2.064 and 1.357; 95% CI, 1.048-1.759, respectively, for I and D alleles), Group 2 (sex-adjusted OR values = 0.753; 95% CI, 0.600-0.945 and 0.775; 95% CI, 0.628-0I.D.

OR - odds ratio; CI - confidence interval. Indeed, e4 has been defined as a frailty allele (30). The second hypothesis suggests that e2 could be a longevity-promoting allele, functioning independently from other ApoE alleles. This hypothesis is supported by our findings showing that the frequency of e3 did not change with advancing age, as would be expected if the e2 increase was due to e4 disappearance in the oldest age group. Indeed, an unchanged e3 allele frequency across age has been reported to be an important prerequisite in carrying out genetic association studies on aging (31). Considering a sample of healthy individuals, we greatly reduced the number of these variables. Alleles with age, were observed in Groups 1, 2, and 4. Heterosis occurs when heterozygotes show either a greater or lesser association with a phenotypic trait than do homozygotes or the wild type. Until now, this genetic phenomenon has not been described in ACE polymorphism and may proveAround the world, there have been several studies conducted on the relationship between genetics and aging. One such study was done by Louhija et al. (1995) which found that the apolipoprotein E phenotype is relatively lost in centenarians. Other studies have also found a decreased frequency of the apolipoprotein E epsilon allele from Northern to Southern Europe in Alzheimer's disease patients and centenarians (Panza et al., 1998), but some studies have shown no association between longevity and common variations in genes associated with cardiovascular risk (Bladbjerg et al., 1999). 

There has also been research on the interaction between different genetic mutations. For example, Isbir et al. (2004) found an interaction between apolipoprotein E and angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype in Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, Agerholm-Larsen et al. (2000) conducted a study on ACE gene polymorphism and ischemic heart disease, finding different allele frequencies between the North and South of Europe. 

Furthermore, there have been studies on risk factors for vascular dementia and cognitive decline in aging individuals. Solfrizzi et al. (2006) found that a high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids can protect against age-related cognitive decline, while Skoog (1998) reviewed various risk factors for vascular dementia. The Mini-Mental State examination is a practical method for grading cognitive state in patients (Folstein et al., 1975). 

In terms of methodology, there are various techniques for genotyping and analyzing genetic polymorphisms, including polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (Houlston et al., 1989), genotyping by one-stage PCR (Wenham et al., 1991), and sequence analysis (Emi et al., 1988). 

Overall, these studies provide insight into the complex relationship between genetics and aging.
