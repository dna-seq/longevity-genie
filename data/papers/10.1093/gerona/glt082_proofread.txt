Evidence from model organisms suggests that the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway has an important and evolutionarily conserved influence over the rate of aging and longevity. In humans, the FOXO3 gene is the only widely replicated insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway gene associated with longevity across multiple populations. Therefore, we conducted a nested case-control study of other insulin/IGF-1 signaling genes and longevity using a large homogeneous long-lived population of American men of Japanese ancestry well-characterized for aging phenotypes. Genotyping was performed for single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging most of the genetic variation across several genes in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway or related gene networks that may be influenced by FOXO3, namely, ATF4, CBL, CDKN2, EXO1, and JUN. Two initial marginal associations with longevity did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons, nor were they correlated with aging-related phenotypes.

Heritability of extreme longevity is estimated as 0.33 and 0.48 in male and female centenarians (1). Although centenarians are enriched for longevity single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (2), few have been identified (3,4), possibly because of small effect sizes (5). 

The insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway is an example of an evolutionarily conserved biological pathway that affects aging (6,7). In humans, a finding of association of genetic variation in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway gene FOXO3A with extreme old age in our cohort of American men of Japanese ancestry (8) has now been consistently replicated in other populations for both sexes.

Methods

Here we report our findings from an exploratory study of SNPs in other evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway genes chosen on the basis of model organism data and human studies, namely, those encoding (i) activating transcription factor 4, which activates stress-resistance genes (9), transcription of the asparagine synthase gene (ASNS) in response to nutrient stress (10), and suppresses the cell senescence/lifespan determining components INK4A/ArF (locus CDKN2A) (11); (ii) Casitas B-cell lymphoma protein, which regulates whole-body energy expenditure and insulin action by suppression of the insulin receptor system. Study Population

The study used a nested case-control design and participants drawn from the HHP/HAAS population described previously (8). These were American men of Japanese ancestry recruited in Oahu in 1965-1968 at ages 45-68 years and followed with regular examinations and blood work until the present, or death. Cases (longevity phenotype) were defined as HHP/HAAS participants who had survived to beyond the upper 1% of the 1910 U.S. birth cohort-specific survival (minimum 95 years of age [19]; n = 213 as of August 2007, 176 died [age of death = 97.5 ± 2.1 SD; range 95-106 years] and 37 were still alive [mean age = 98.7 ± 2.1 SD; range 97-106 years]). Controls consisted of 402 individuals from the HHP/HAAS cohort who had died near the mean for the 1910 U.S. birth cohort-specific survival for middle-aged men (77 years). To achieve a case:control ratio of approximately 1:2, we sampled the HHP/HAAS study populationNucleotide Total Number of Minor Allele Frequency of Cases/ Polymorphism ID Alleles Case/Controls Controls; n (%; 95% CI) 2 p-Value

One-way ANOVA did not detect any relationship between factors associated with insulin sensitivity, a potential intermediate phenotype of longevity, and genotype. For non-normally distributed variables, we used log transformation to approximate a normal distribution.

There was no association between other phenotypes and any of the SNPs in Table 1 (Supplementary Table 2). Nor was there a relationship between any of the genotypes and maximum age attained in either the case or the control groups (data not shown).

Variants not present in other populations may exist that could be associated with longevity.

For the two SNPs with marginal association with longevity before Bonferroni correction, no significant association was found with a range of aging-related phenotypes, common diseases, or a combined phenotype representing healthy aging.

A limitation of our cohort was that it only included male participants. Thus, the SNPs tested could be associated with longevity or other aging-related phenotypes in female participants, as shown for the SNP in EXO1 in female but not male German centenarians (21). The longevity-associated allele in the EXO1 promoter, by elevating EXO1 expression, could theoretically have an effect on longevity.

Discussion

To date, findings on genetic variants conferring an increase in human lifespan are limited (23). This reflects, in part, the difficulty of obtaining cohorts of suitable study participants who have attained extreme old age. Therefore, given sufficient power, any data, whether positive or negative, may be instructive in deciphering the molecular genetic etiology of human longevity.
