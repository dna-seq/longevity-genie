The association of TP53 P72R (rs1042522) with longevity remains uncertain and varies with ethnicity. Here, we its association with longevity in a cross-sectional population of Central Italy (18–106 years, n = 1,072), by ing demographic information and frequency data to account for the different survival rates between sexes through application of a genetic-demographic approach. rs1042522 affects females longevity, showing significant in Comparison 2 (Age Class 3 [>91 years] vs Age Class 2 [73–91 years]) under both additive (odds ratio [oR] p = .006) and dominant (oR 0.513; p = .006) models. The TP53*P72 allele is significantly underrepresented in Age 3 only in women (oR 0.575; p = .008). The genetic-demographic approach demonstrated that the frequency of TP53*P72 carriers underwent a significant reduction after 82 years (oR 0.586; p = .002). The same analyses gave significant results in men. The discrepancies among the results obtained on rs1042522 for longevity could result from pleiotropic effects of p53 and the potential ethnic variation of its functional variants.

ing apoptosis and suppressing cellular transformation and has a lower transcriptional activity toward a subset of p53 target genes involved in apoptosis and DNA repair com- pared with the TP53*R72 allele (5). Thus, in light of the striking impact of rs1042522 on p53 function, several studies have been undertaken to address its role in longev- ity with inconsistent results. No significant differences in rs1042522 distribution were detected in various age classes of Italian centenarians (6,7) and in the Ashkenazi popula- tion (8), as well. However, studies of Swedish and Dutch long-lived people, which included follow-up, revealed that the P72* allele was associated with an enhanced capacity to survive (9,10). Intriguingly, rs1042522 frequencies cor- relate with latitude but are similar in ethnic groups dwelling in the same geographical regions. This finding led to the hypothesis that they may be involved in climatic adaptation (11) and provide a potential explanation for the association

locus 17p13.1, OMIM*191170) is the main determi- nant of cellular stress responses and regulates target genes inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and/or metabolic changes. Mutation of TP53 is one of the most frequent oncogenic events in human cancer. Moreover, TP53 has been involved in organismal aging (1,2). Gain-of-function TP53 mutations have been linked not only to a reduced frequency of tumors but also to accel- erated aging and premature death in mice (3). This evidence supports the view that TP53 could be considered a gene that affects human longevity.

A functional nonsynonymous single nucleotide poly- morphism located in exon 4 of the TP53 gene (rs1042522), leading to a P72R substitution, has been extensively stud- ied in reference to several diseases, from cancer to schizo- phrenia (4). Marked functional differences exist between the two forms of the p53 protein (4); it has been reported

5ʹ–TGCTCTTTTCACCCATCTAC–3ʹ and 5ʹ–CGTGCAA GTCACAGACTT–3ʹ (Sigma-Aldrich, MO). An initial denaturation at 95°C for 9 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 61°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, with a final extension at 72°C for 4 minutes. PCR prod- ucts (301 bp) were digested at 60°C for 3 hours with BstUI (NEB). Restriction fragments were visualized on 2% aga- rose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and genotypes were assigned as previously reported (13). Each sample was genotyped in duplicate with a positive control. DNA sequencing was performed on 40 random samples showing 100% concordance with PCR–RFLP method.

between the polymorphism and longevity being found only in populations living in northern geographic areas.

studies in genetic epidemiology and the marked differences of genotype frequency distribution among ethnic groups, we attempt to replicate previous findings by testing the association of rs1042522 with longevity in a healthy population of Central Italy through a cross-sectional study, by applying a genetic-demographic (GD) approach that takes into account the demographic information and different survival rates between sexes for modeling the survival of specific allele carriers in the population.

Methods

Demographics

GD approach

Peripheral blood was obtained from 1,072 (569 women and 503 men) unrelated individuals, 18- to 106-years old, recruited from the same geographical area of Central Italy (Marche region), on the eastern side of the Apennines. The whole population studied is composed of Caucasian individuals. The same donors provided information con- cerning their health condition so as to ascertain that no pathological condition existed (eg, cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension, obesity, and chronic inflammatory diseases). Participant’s age is self-reported and is corrobo- rated with official documentation. Almost all participants were recruited in blood donor centers and through family physicians. The population under study was divided into three sex-specific age classes: for men (women), the first class consists of individuals younger than 66 years (<73- years old), the second class of individuals aged 66 to 88 years (73- to 91-years old), and the third class of individuals older than 88 years (>91-years old). These gender-specific age classes were defined according to demographic informa- tion and accounted for the different survival rates of men and women in the Italian population (12). Briefly, the age classes ranging from 18 to 106 years were obtained on the basis of a synthetic survival curve constructed using historic mortality data taken from the Italian population from 1890 onward (computed using death counts per calendar year and per year of birth as reported for the Italian population in the Human Mortality Database, available online at www. mortality.org [12]). The study protocol was approved by the Joint Ethical Committee (JEC) University of Camerino– Azienda ASUR Marche ZT-10 Camerino, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in its revised edition and with international and local regulatory requirements.

The survival function of participants was determined by applying a GD approach. The method allows the estima- tion of a survival function for candidate alleles and geno- types in cross-sectional samples of unrelated individuals (14). A detailed description of the analytical procedure is reported elsewhere (15). Briefly, in order to take into account the changes in mortality experienced by all the cohorts considered in the study, a synthetic survival func- tion of the general population was constructed. Then, the marginal survival functions Sa(x) and Sb(x) of carri- ers and noncarriers, respectively, of the TP53*P72 allele were determined according to the following relationship: Ss(x) = PSa(x) + (1 − P)Sb(x), where Ss(x) is the survival function of the whole Italian population (synthetic curve) and P(1 − P) is the initial frequency of carriers (noncarriers) in the population. Because this frequency should be that before survival selection begins to operate consistently, the sample of 18- to 35-year-old participants, in reproductive age, was used for estimating the parameter P. Statistical significance of the differences between the survival curves of carriers/noncarriers/general population was obtained by a random permutation procedure, by applying 1,000 rep- licates. Demographic data on the Italian population were downloaded by the website www.mortality.org. The Matlab 6.1 package was used for GD analyses.

Statistical analysis

Allele and genotype frequency were calculated by geno- type counting method. Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium was assessed by comparing the genotype frequencies with the expected values using a contingency table χ2 statistics. Genotype association was tested under additive, dominant, and recessive models. Cochran–Armitage test of trend was employed for the additive model. Pearson’s χ2 or Fisher’s Exact test (when expected is <5) were used to evaluate the dominant model, the recessive model, and the allelic association. The strength of association was expressed as odds ratios (oR) with 95% confidence intervals (ci).

Genomic DNA extraction was carried out from periph- eral blood through standardized salting-out method and DNA was stored at −

°C until gene analysis.

Genomic DNA extraction was carried out from periph- eral blood through standardized salting-out method and DNA was stored at −20°C until gene analysis.

For rs1042522 genotyping, PCR was performed using PCR Master Mix (2×; Fermentas), with a primer set,

difference between the frequencies is statistically signifi- cant (oR 0.586; 95% ci 0.420–0.817; p = .002).

The TP53*P72 was considered the “risk allele” because of the previous associations found between *P72 allele and enhanced survival in Dutch and Swedish long-lived people

In men, the difference between the survival functions of carriers (SA(x)), noncarriers (SB(x)), and the male popula- tion (S(x)) is not even significant (p = .930), but in this case, no crossing of the survival curves was observed, suggesting no association of this polymorphism with survival in the male sample.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Two-tailed probability values of less than .05 were regarded as statistically significant. Bonferroni’s correction for multiple testing was not performed, since we are assessing specific questions on a gene previously tested for association with human longevity, and we are not searching for associations without a priori hypotheses (16).

Discussion

During the last 20 years, the rs1042522 has been extensively studied and numerous findings have been proven to be effective and relevant for some pathogenetic mechanisms underlying common phenotypes and life- threatening diseases. However, its role in aging and longevity still raises several questions and conflicting results. Here, we provide novel evidence for rs1042522 in longevity; in the Central Italy population, we studied, that the TP53*P72 allele influences negatively female life expectancy. We did not detect any association of rs1042522 with longevity in men, a finding consistent with previous studies conducted in Italian (cross-sectional study) and Ashkenazi (case– control) populations (7,8). In contrast to our results, the follow-up study on the cohort of 9,219 participants aged 20–95 years from the Danish general population by Ørsted and colleagues (9) demonstrated an increased frequency of P*/P* homozygotes and the TP53*P72 allele with increasing age toward 90 years. A similar result was obtained in the prospective Leiden 85-plus follow-up study that reported a 1.41-fold increase in survival of carriers of the P*/P* genotype compared with R*/R* carriers (p = .032 [10]). However, contrary to the study of Ørsted and colleagues (9), no survival benefit was noticed for the R*/P* genotype, survival being 0.95-fold lower (p = .550 [10]). Both the longitudinal studies (9,10) used gender- adjusted hazard ratios, whereas the Italian cross-sectional study (7) was conducted on the whole population enrolled without stratifying by gender.

Results

The allele and genotype frequency distributions of the rs1042522 were compared among the age classes, men and women separately (Table 1). No significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium expectation was detected among the gender-specific age classes. The genotype dis- tribution and the allele frequency in Age Class 1 (women + men) are comparable to that previously reported for Italian population (p > .205 [6]). Therefore, the sample can be con- sidered a representative sample of the continental Italian population. The rs1042522 affects female longevity, show- ing significant associations in Comparison 2 (Age Class 3 vs Age Class 2) under both additive (common oR 0.574; p = .006] and dominant (oR 0.513; 95% ci 0.317–0.830; p = .006) genetic models (Table 1). The P72* allele is sig- nificantly underrepresented in Age Class 3 only in women (Comparison 2: allele, oR 0.575; 95% ci 0.381–0.866; p = .008).

As the GD method requires the assumption of domi- nance of an allele upon the other, a P72* > R72* dominant relationship was assumed. Figure 1 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the survival functions of TP53*P72 carriers (P*/P* plus P*/R* participants (blue curve) and of R*/R* participants (red curve), compared with the general Italian population (green curve). Panel A shows the female population, whereas panel B shows the male one.

It has been suggested that the different rs1042522 fre- quencies between young and long-living people observed in different populations can be explained by hypothesizing that TP53 genotypes may differently predispose to diverse age- related diseases. Thus, the genotype frequencies observed in centenarians (or long-living people) could be the result of a population-specific balancing between opposite ten- dencies toward an increased or decreased risk of different life-threatening diseases (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc.). Furthermore, the presence of different study designs (from case–control to prospective follow-up) is remark- able. Therefore, when interpreting the results obtained to date, one must take into account the advantages and pitfalls of each methodological approach used. It is also notewor- thy that rs1042522 heterozygotes show opposite mortality risk in the two prospective follow-up studies conducted in Dutch and in Danish populations (9,10).

In women, the survival curve of P72* carriers shows a prevalent best survival chance along the most part of life, respect the survival of noncarriers. The difference between survival curves is not significant, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the survival functions of carriers (SA(x)), noncarriers (SB(x)), and the female population (S(x)), are equal (p = .115). However, around 85 years of age, in women, we observe a crossing of the survival curves, suggesting that carrying the allele P72* is disadvan- tageous after this age.

The analysis of the differences between the survival esti- mations age by age showed that the age of intersection is x = 82 years. Indeed, the frequency of allele P72* carriers is 53% in the age class 18–82 years (154 carriers and 133 noncarriers), whereas it is reduced to 40% in the age class 83–106 years (114 carriers and 168 noncarriers), and the

Maximum likelihood estimates of the survival functions of P72* carriers (P*/P* plus P*/R*) participants (Sa(x); blue curve) and R*/R* homozygotes (Sb(x); red curve) aged between 18 and 106 years. The synthetic survival function of the Italian population (Ss(x); green curve), is reported for reference. (A) Women, (difference between survival curves, p = .115). (B) Men (difference between survival curves, p = .930).

meta-analysis also showed that female patients with liver cancer had a significantly lower frequency of R*/R* and a higher frequency of P* allele carriers than females without cancer (22). The same analysis yielded no significant result in males (22). Gender-specific differences were also found in colon cancer, where the P72* carriers compared with R*/R* were associated with an increased risk of proximal colon cancers in women though not with distal colon, whereas among men, the same genotypes were associated with an increased risk of distal colon cancers, but not proximal colon cancers (23). Moreover, it has been reported that breast cancer patients with P*/P* genotype have a poorer survival (24,25).

using a cross-sectional approach on a healthy population divided into three sex-specific age classes according to demographic information and accounting for the differ- ent survival rates of men and women. We also applied the GD approach to our data, thus providing a novel view of the effect of rs1042522 on human longevity. By monitor- ing the survival function of each genotype at different ages, the GD approach allows to identify the alleles/genotypes that are favorable or unfavorable to longevity without intro- ducing arbitrary age classes, taking into account also the cohort effects in mortality changes (15). Moreover, the GD approach allows to determine the age where a certain geno- type affects survival chance, also revealing sex-specific allelic effects and possibly pleiotropic effect of an allele during the individual life (15).

A very important element contributing to the gender- specific association detected here is the estrogen hormone. A strong relationship of estrogen signaling and estrogen receptor with p53 has been documented, where ERα and p53 physically interact, leading to inhibition of p53 func- tion in cell culture and xenograft models (26). Thus, it is conceivable that in women, the inhibition of p53 function can be stronger than in men, especially in TP53*P allele carriers, leading to a significant impairment of apoptotic mechanisms. This event may be associated to an increased risk of cancer, immune senescence, and autoimmunity (27). In this context, it is remarkable that women display an increased risk for autoimmune diseases compared with men (28).

Several suggestions can be made about the gender- specific association of TP53*P72 allele with life expec- tancy. First, we have to take into account the difference between the two polymorphic p53 variants: the P72 is weaker than the R72 variant in inducing apoptosis and sup- pressing cellular transformation but appears to be better at initiating senescence and cell cycle arrest (17,18).

specific effect of p53 on life span (19); the consequences of modulating p53 were found to be also tissue and stage specific (19). Indeed, ubiquitous overexpression of p53 in adults shortens life span in females but slightly increases life span in males (20), whereas neuronal expression of the same construct extends life span in females and decreases life span in males (21). Overexpressing p53 in larval stages, on the other hand, is sufficient to extend adult life span in both sexes, but in a dose-dependent manner, where strong expression is deleterious for life span, whereas moderate- to-weak overexpression increases life span (20). A recent

Extensive research over the past two decades has placed p53 at the hub of a very complex network of signaling path- ways that integrate a variety of intracellular and extracel- lular inputs. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that the opposing effects of various components of the p53 signal- ing network must be carefully balanced to correctly regulate p53 function and induce the appropriate cellular response (29,30). Under normal conditions, p53 is expressed at a

low level and has a short half-life. When cells are exposed to a stressful environment, p53 is activated, resulting in transcriptional regulation of many target genes, including the MDM2 gene. A reduced MDM2-mediated degradation of p53–R72 variant compared with p53–P72 variant was recently reported (31). Notably, a single nucleotide poly- morphism in the MDM2 promoter (SNP309), leading to elevated MDM2 expression and attenuated efficiency of the p53 pathway, is regulated by estrogen signaling (32–34). Interestingly, SNP309 (G/G) seems to have a more signifi- cant effect on accelerating tumor formation in a gender-spe- cific (women) and hormonal-dependent manner (35–37). Also, recent results suggest the possibility that SNP309 G allele may contribute to gender-specific tumorigenesis through further elevating the MDM2 levels and disrupting the p53–MDM2 oscillation (38). Indeed, a gender-specific gene–gene interaction between the two polymorphisms was found in nonoropharyngeal cancer, where the youngest age at onset was observed in female patients with the combined MDM2 SNP309 G/G and TP53 codon 72 P*/P* genotypes (39). In breast cancer, homozygous carriers of the G-allele in MDM2 had worse survival only within the group of TP53*P72 carriers (25).

In conclusion, the discrepancies among the results obtained on rs1042522 for longevity in different popula- tions could result from the pleiotropic effects of p53 and the potential ethnic variation of its functional variants. The gen- der-specific association of rs1042522 with life expectancy clearly claims for future investigations. Manipulating p53 expression in mouse models in p53 dose–specific, mouse tissue–specific, developmental stage–specific, and sex-spe- cific manners may further shed light on the role of p53 in aging and longevity in mammals (5). Thus, only a wider analysis of genetic and environmental factors influencing p53 pathway could definitively address the role of p53 pro- tein in human longevity.
