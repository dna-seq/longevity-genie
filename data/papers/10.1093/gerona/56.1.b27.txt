Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is the major component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. One of six identified polymorphisms in the apoC-III 59-untranslated region (T-455C) is located within a functional insulin-response element. In a group of 137 elderly individuals (70–106 years old), the allele distribution was analyzed using re- striction fragment length polymorphisms. Statistical analysis of allele frequencies was performed on subgroups selected by age and in elderly patients with arterial hypertension or ischemic heart disease. A greater frequency of the apoC-III 2455C allele was demonstrated with aging (p , .005). No statistically significant difference in al- lele distributions was detected between healthy subjects and groups of elderly patients of the same age with either ischemic heart disease or arterial hypertension. The increased incidence of the C allele with advanced age indi- cates that this variant promoter is associated with longevity. The greater incidence of this allele is detectable only in adults older than 80 years of age.

H UMAN apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is a major component of very low-density lipoproteins and plasma chylomicrons and a minor component of high den- sity lipoproteins (HDLs). It plays an important role in mod- ulating the hydrolysis of triglycerides and cholesterol through inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (1–4); therefore, the plasma levels of triglycerides correlate directly with the quantity of apoC-III (4,5). Six polymorphisms have been identified in the promoter region of the apoC-III gene at po- sitions -935, -641, -630, -625, -482 and -455 (6,7). The pro- moter region containing these polymorphic sites is essential for maximal expression of apoC-III in cultured cells (8). The most proximal polymorphism, T-455C, is located within a 10-base-pair (bp) region whose sequence is similar to that of the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) insulin/phorbol ester response element (9). This region al- lows insulin to influence the metabolism of apoC-III through the regulation of the gene’s transcriptional activity (10). Interestingly, the apoC-III variant (-455C) allele in- creases the sequence identity of the -454 to -462 element to the corresponding area in the PEPCK gene. A functional in- sulin-response element (IRE) in the human apoC-III pro- moter (C3IRE) has been mapped to the -490 to -449 region (11,12). This 42 nucleotide region contains two sequence variants at -455 and -482 positions, which strongly affect apoC-III gene expression following insulin treatment (12). It has been shown that a single bp change of T-455C par- tially inhibits the ability of the variant apoC-III promoter to respond to insulin in vitro (12). The location of this poly- morphism in the IRE and its ability to influence the expres- sion of apoC-III suggest a link between two major compo-

nents of syndrome X: abnormal glucose metabolism and hypertriglyceridemia (13,14). Elevated plasma levels of in- sulin are highly associated with increased blood pressure through activation of sympathoadrenal system, and a strong correlation between these two indices occurs in states of in- sulin resistance (15–17). Thus, hypertension, as a constitu- ent part of syndrome X, could result from an altered re- sponse of the apoC-III promoter to insulin.

Among the polymorphisms in the apoC-III promoter re- gion, the T-455C polymorphism has been studied in several populations (Table 1). Although no statistically significant differences were detected in the distribution of T/C alleles in a group of white Americans (18) and among Italian chil- dren (7), the increased incidence of the C allele was, how- ever, associated with elevated triglycerides and depressed HDL cholesterol, as well as higher total cholesterol to HDL ratio and apolipoprotein B (apoB) to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) ratio in a group of young Sandy Lake Canadian In- dians (19). Moreover, among two recent studies, both per- formed on Dutch populations, one failed to associate the IRE polymorphisms with any changes in plasma lipid traits (20), although another confirmed previous findings, demon- strating an association of the -455C allele with family dys- betalipoprotinaemia and hypertriglyceridemia (21).

The picture is intensely complicated by the linkage dise- quilibrium of the studied T-455C polymorphism with other polymorphisms of the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV complex. The 9 apoC-III 3 -untranslated region SstI polymorphism, which is generally believed to play an important role in the devel- opment of endogenous hypertriglyceridemia (6,7,12,18), excluding some ethnic and age groups (22–24), is not oblig-

atorily associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) (21,23, 25). This increases a potential role of other contributing polymorphisms. Multiple haplotypes, including the poly- morphic sites of the cluster, have been reported to influence the plasma levels of lipids and triglycerides (6,12,22). How- ever, all studies that included IRE T-455C polymorphism analysis, had subjects with different forms of hyperlipi- demia and hypertriglyceridemia (7,18–21). No studies have analyzed this polymorphism in an aging population.

Whole venous blood was collected in ethylenediamine- tetraacetic acid, sample tubes, and genomic DNA was ex- tracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by a phenol-chlo- roform method (26) with minor modifications.

Two oligonucleotide primers were designed for amplifi- cation of the DNA region containing the T-455C polymor- 9 phism: reverse primer 5 -ATC TCA GCC TTT CAC ACT 9 9 GGA ATT T-3 (-351– -327) and forward primer 5 -GTC 9 TTC TGT GCC TTT ACT CCA AAG A-3 (-480– -456). 9 The forward primer contained, as the 3 -penultimate nucle- otide, a G rather than the native C residue. Thus, elongation fi of this primer led to site-directed mutagenesis (C G in the coding strand at position -457) and formation of a MboI site fi for the -455T (CATC GATC) allele, but not for the -455C fi (CACC GACC) allele (Figure 1).

The main purpose of our study was to determine whether the apoC-III T-455C polymorphism is important for sur- vival and which allele is associated with longevity. To study this question, we examined the distribution of the T-455C apoC-III polymorphism in a population-based sample of 137 elderly individuals (70–106 years old) with subgroups se- lected by age. A group of 110 healthy schoolchildren served as a control population to determine the initial distribution of the alleles.

m Amplification of 1 g of genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using 25 pmol of for- ward primer and 50 pmol of reverse primer with 0.8 unit of Taq polymerase (Institute of Genetics, Moscow, Russia) in m a total reaction volume of 30 l (20 mmol/l Tris HCl, pH 8.8; 10 mmol/l (NH ) SO ; 2.3 mmol/l MgCl ; and 50 4 2 4 2 m mol/l each deoxynucleoside triphosphate). Cycling condi- 8 tions were as follows: the initial cycle of 1 minute at 95 C, 1 8 8 minute at 52 C, 1 minute at 72 C; 29 cycles for 1 minute at 938 C, 1 minute at 568 C, 1 minute at 728 C; and a final exten- sion at 728 C for 5 minutes. A hot start was used to avoid nonspecific amplification. Nine m l of the PCR reaction products were diluted to 10 m l by the recommended restric- tion buffer containing 0.5 unit of MboI (MBI, Fermentas, Lithuania) and digested at 378 C overnight. Restriction prod- ucts were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Possible patterns were 154 bp (C in -455 position) and 131 bp 1 23 bp fragments (T in the -455 position; Figure 1C). P values were determined using the x2 test and two-tailed Fisher ex- act test to compare frequencies in different groups.

The T-455C apoC-III polymorphism, located within the functional IRE, demonstrates a greater frequency of the C-allele proportion with aging. However, we failed to find any statistically significant differences in the distribution of T and C alleles between age-dependent groups of patients with IHD and arterial hypertension (AH) and healthy con- trol groups of the same age.

M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS

A group of 147 elderly individuals (70–106 years old; mean age, 84.6 years) was selected from patients of the City Geriatric Center and the St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregu- lation and Gerontology in St. Petersburg, Russia. In this group, ten pairs of elderly siblings were present (20 subjects from 10 different families; mean age, 91.3 years); only the oldest individual from each family was analyzed. Together with individuals without elderly siblings, the study com- prised 137 subjects with a mean age of 84.4 years. Subjects were divided into several age-differentiated subgroups: group 1 (43 subjects, 70–79 years old; mean age, 74.4 years), group 2 (52 subjects, 80–89 years old; mean age, 84.4 years), and group 3 (42 subjects, 90–106 years old; mean age, 94.5 years). Information about AH and IHD was obtained based on long-standing clinical observations. The control group included 110 schoolchildren aged 6 to 17 years old (group 4; mean age, 11.0 years) from three sec- ondary schools in St. Petersburg. The ethnic composition in both the elderly and control groups was controlled via the analysis of last names and was found to be identical, with a major preponderance of Russian names and a minor presence

R D ESULTS AND ISCUSSION

We analyzed DNA samples from the following groups of St. Petersburg citizens: group 1 (43 subjects, 70–79 years old), group 2 (52 subjects, 80–89 years old), group 3 (42 subjects, 90–106 years old), and group 4 (110 subjects, 6–17 years old). The frequencies of T and C alleles in the control group (group 4) were 0.550 and 0.450, respectively. This distribution is comparable with 0.700/0.300 in a healthy adult white American population (18), and 0.690/0.310 (21) . or 0.655/0.345 (20) in healthy Dutch populations (p .05

for each group). Interestingly, the observed distribution of alleles in young (6–17 years) St. Petersburg citizens closely matched those in the group of Italian schoolchildren (11–13 years; 0.596/0.404) (7) and young (9–17 years) Canadian Indians (0.556/0.444) (19), suggesting that the initial allele distribution is similar in different populations (Table 1).

0.619, respectively, suggesting that a gradual loss of the T-allele proportion, with a relative accumulation of the , , C-allele proportion occurs with age (p .05 and p .02, , 1 respectively, and p .002 for pooled groups 2 3 vs group 4). The reliability of subject group size was confirmed with a two-proportions power analysis. A greater incidence of the C allele occurs around the age of 80 to 89 years and con- tinues with further aging (Figure 2). These results indicate that the variant (-455C) allele of the apoC-III T-455C poly- morphism is associated with longevity, and the factors in- volved relate to the elderly age.

The frequencies of T and C alleles in the total pool of 137 elderly individuals were 0.453 and 0.547, respectively (Ta- ble 2), indicating that, in an elderly Russian population, al- lele C prevails over T when compared with the distribution , of alleles at a young age (p .005). In group 1, allele C was found at a frequency of 0.465, which is quite close to its ini- tial presence in population (0.450). However, in groups 2 and 3, allele C was found with frequencies of 0.558 and

To investigate the possible pathways of the -455C al- lele’s relative accumulation, the statistical analysis of the allele distribution was performed on groups of patients

with AH and IHD. No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated between the group of AH patients and healthy controls of the same age. Although not statisti- cally significant, a higher C-allele proportion was observed among AH patients in group 2 over their healthy counter- parts compared with the increase of the C-allele proportion among healthy subjects over AH patients in group 3 (Table 3). Analysis of the distribution of the T and C alleles in groups of subjects with or without IHD also failed to asso- ciate the variant allele with disease. In contrast to the allele distribution in AH, the C-allele proportion was increased in subjects without IHD in group 2 and in IHD patients in group 3 (Table 4). The distribution of alleles also showed no statistically significant difference when comparing a group of healthy individuals with the groups of AH pa- 1 tients, IHD patients, and AH IHD patients of the same . age (p .05 for each group, data not shown). A two-pro- portions power analysis comparing the groups of individu- als with or without AH or IHD in the same age groups demonstrated that the size of each group must be 2000 to 4800 subjects to make indicated differences in -455C-allele proportions statistically significant.

This finding does not support earlier reports of the variant promoter being involved in the development of hypertri- glyceridemia (19,21) and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (21). Recently, it has been shown that at least in some sub- jects, the -455C allele can lead to a significant extension of the apoC-III abundance in vivo (27). The proposed mecha- nism involves partial inhibition of IRE response to insulin in subjects carrying the -455C allele of the apoC-III pro- moter (12), resulting in an increase of the plasma choles- terol and triglyceride levels and leading to atherosclerosis and further development of IHD. In contrast, a protective role of the haplotype containing the C allele of the -455 po- sition, unlike the T allele, has been reported with respect to the development of hypertriglyceridemia (18). Taken to- gether, it is unclear if any of the alleles is principally in- volved in the development of IHD or reflects solely ethnic or population differences.

longevity suggests involvement of other pathways, which may be important for survival. As our data suggest, the time when the C allele exhibits its protective properties lies in the age range of group 2 subjects (80–89 years old). In subse- quent years, it continues to work, as the C-allele proportion increases considerably in group 3 subjects (90–106 years old). Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in elderly individuals, but IHD and AH are not associated with increased incidence of the variant allele of the T-455C poly- morphism. Cancer, the second leading cause of death in de- veloped countries with long life spans, has a controversial relationship with the levels of serum cholesterol and triglyc- erides. At least for two tumor localizations, breast and col- orectal cancer, the level of cholesterol has an inverted corre- lation with the rate of malignancy. At the same time, the level of triglycerides is a positive risk factor for other tumor localizations (28,29). Thus, the possible influence of the C allele on the development of certain localizations of cancer and subsequent changes in the rate of survival cannot be ex- cluded. Other potential pathways involved are insulin resis- tance and AH counteractions. Insulin, together with phorbol esters, can inhibit the transcription of the PEPCK gene, thus decrease gluconeogenesis (9,30), and simultaneously directly repress the apoC-III promoter through its own PEPCK-like insulin/phorbol ester-response element (10). Complications of insulin-resistance and developing diabetes mellitus are known to considerably contribute to total mortality. Possible involvement of linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphic sites of the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV complex in the cumulation of the variant (-455C) allele must be also acknowledged, de-

The -455C allele of the apoC-III polymorphism does not seem to affect the predisposition to IHD in this population.

spite the controversial findings on the effect of haplotypes, including -455 apoC-III polymorphism (7,18–21). World trends in older population mortality reductions may further contribute to the age-specific differences in studied gene al- lele proportions and genotypes observed, as mortality pat- terns could differ for the carriers of different alleles, but this factor equally inclines genetic aspects of all cross-sectional gerontological studies (31,32).

the close distribution of allele frequencies in the group and those of subjects aged 70 to 79 years old youngest group of elderly subjects studied) make the tution of cross-sectionally–studied groups reliable.

Geriatric populations allow assessment of polymorphic sites for longevity and survival. Control groups consisting of children provide valuable information regarding the orig- inal distribution of alleles of interest in a particular popula- tion. The use of young and older age groups in our study gave us the ability to detect the effect of relative accumula- tion with age of the apoC-III gene T-455C polymorphism C allele. Although we show that in this population none of the polymorphism alleles is associated with IHD or AH, the question of the possible mechanisms involved is still open and should stimulate further investigations.

St. Petersburg has one of the most advanced systems of geriatric help in Russia, which, together with the size of its population, made our study possible. However, the longitu- dinal cohort studies covering these wide age ranges are quite hard to perform. We have to admit that the initial fre- quencies of respective alleles and genotypes could differ slightly in the elderly and children’s groups, as there is no way to ensure genetic solidarity of these groups when tak- ing into account the losses the St. Petersburg population suf- fered during the Siege of 1941 to 1944 and the resulting changes in population structure. However, the fact that St. Petersburg was repopulated almost exclusively by the evac- uated dwellers and members of their families, the ethnic likeness of both the control and subject groups studied, and

The proposed method of -455 apoC-III polymorphism identification based on the mismatch PCR-mediated site- directed mutagenesis and restriction fragment length poly- morphism seems to be time- and cost-reducing compared with other nonradioactive methods, such as allele-specific amplification and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridiza- tion, described previously (33).
