TP53*P72 allele negatively affects female life expectancy in a population of Central Italy according to a cross-sectional study and genetic-demographic analysis. The study aimed to investigate the association of TP53 P72R (rs1042522) with longevity in a population of Central Italy (18106 years, n = 1,072) by considering demographic information and frequency data to account for different survival rates between sexes through applying a genetic-demographic approach. The results showed that rs1042522 affects female longevity, being significant in Comparison 2 (Age Class 3 [>91 years] vs Age Class 2 [73-91 years]) under both additive (odds ratio [oR] p = .006) and dominant (oR 0.513; p = .006) models. The TP53*P72 allele is significantly underrepresented in Age 3 only in women (oR 0.575; p = .008). The genetic-demographic approach demonstrated that the frequency of TP53*P72 carriers underwent a significant reduction after 82 years (oR 0.586; p = .002). The same analyses gave significant results in men. The study suggests that the discrepancies among the results obtained on rs1042522 for longevity could result from pleiotropic effects of p53 and the potential ethnic variation of its functional variants.The frequencies are statistically significant (OR 0.586; 95% CI 0.420-0.817; p = .002). The TP53*P72 allele was considered the risk allele due to previous associations found between the *P72 allele and enhanced survival in Dutch and Swedish long-lived people. In men, there is no significant difference between the survival functions of carriers (SA(x)), noncarriers (SB(x)), and the male population (S(x)) (p = .930), but in this case, no crossing of the survival curves was observed, suggesting no association of this polymorphism with survival in the male sample. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Two-tailed probability values of less than .05 were regarded as statistically significant. Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing was not performed since we are assessing specific questions on a gene previously tested for association with human longevity, and we are not searching for associations without a priori hypotheses (16).

During the last 20 years, rs1042522 has been extensively studied, and numerous findings have been proven effective and relevant for some pathogenic mechanisms underlying common phenotypes and life-threatening diseases. However, its role in aging and longevity still raises several questions and conflicting results. Here, we provide novel evidence for rs1042522 in longevity; in the Central Italy population we studied, the TP53*P72 allele influences negatively female life expectancy. We did not detect any association of rs1042522 with longevity in men, a finding consistent with previous studies conducted in Italian (cross-sectional study) and Ashkenazi (case-control) populations (7,8). In contrast to our results, the follow-up study on the cohort of 9,219 participants aged 20-95 years from the Danish general population by Ørsted and colleagues (9) demonstrated an increased frequency of P*/P* homozygotes and the TP53*P72 allele with increasing age toward 90 years. A similar result was obtained in the prospective Leiden 85-plus follow-up study that reported a 1.41-fold increase in survival of carriers of the P*/P* genotype compared with R*/R* carriers (p = .032 [10]). However, contrary to the study of Ørsted and colleagues (9), no survival benefit was noticed for the R*/P* genotype, survival being 0.95-fold lower (p = .550 [10]). Both longitudinal studies (9,10) used gender-adjusted hazard ratios, whereas the Italian cross-sectional study (7) was conducted on the whole population enrolled without stratifying by gender.

Results: The allele and genotype frequency distributions of rs1042522 were compared among the age classes, men and women separately (Table 1). No significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium expectation was detected among the gender-specific age classes. The genotype distribution and allele frequency in Age Class 1 (women + men) are comparable to that previously reported for the Italian population (p > .205 [6]). Therefore, the sample can be considered a representative sample of the continental Italian population. Rs1042522 affects female longevity, showing significant associations in Comparison 2 (Age Class 3 vs Age Class 2) under both additive (common OR 0.574; p = .006) and dominant (OR 0.513; 95% CI 0.317-0.830; p = .006) genetic models (Table 1). The P72* allele is significantly underrepresented in Age Class 3 only in women (Comparison 2: allele, OR 0.575; 95% CI 0.381-0.866; p = .008).

As the GD method requires the assumption of dominance of one allele over the other, a P72* > R72* dominant relationship was assumed. Figure 1 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the survival functions of TP53*P72 carriers (P*/P* plus P*/R*) participants (blue curve) and R*/R* participants (red curve), compared with the general Italian population (green curve). Panel A shows the female population, whereas panel B shows the male one.

It has been suggested that the different rs1042522 frequencies between young and long-living people observed in different populations can be explained by hypothesizing that TP53 genotypes may differently predispose to diverse age-related diseases. Thus, the genotype frequencies observed in centenarians (or long-living people) could be the result of a population-specific balancing between opposite tendencies toward an increased or decreased risk of different life-threatening diseases (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc.). Furthermore, the presence of different study designs (from case-control to prospective follow-up) is remarkable. Therefore, when interpreting the results obtained to date, one must take into account the advantages and pitfallsThe GD approach allows identification of favorable or unfavorable alleles/genotypes for longevity at different ages, without introducing arbitrary age classes. It also takes into account cohort effects in mortality changes (15). The approach determines the age at which a genotype affects survival chance, revealing sex-specific allelic effects and possibly pleiotropic effects of an allele during an individual's life (15).

A significant element contributing to the gender-specific association detected here is the estrogen hormone. A strong relationship between estrogen signaling and the estrogen receptor with p53 has been documented, where ER and p53 physically interact, leading to inhibition of p53 function in cell culture and xenograft models (26). Thus, it is conceivable that in women, the inhibition of p53 function can be stronger than in men, especially in TP53*P allele carriers, leading to a significant impairment of apoptotic mechanisms. This event may be associated with an increased risk of cancer, immune senescence, and autoimmunity (27). In this context, it is remarkable that women display an increased risk for autoimmune diseases compared to men (28).

Several suggestions can be made about the gender-specific association of TP53*P72 allele with life expectancy. First, we have to take into account the difference between the two polymorphic p53 variants: the P72 is weaker than the R72 variant in inducing apoptosis and suppressing cellular transformation but appears to be better at initiating senescence and cell cycle arrest (17,18). There is a specific effect of p53 on lifespan (19); modulating p53 has tissue- and stage-specific consequences (19). Ubiquitous overexpression of p53 in adults shortens lifespan in females but slightly increases lifespan in males (20), whereas neuronal expression of the same construct extends lifespan in females and decreases lifespan in males (21). Overexpressing p53 in larval stages is sufficient to extend adult lifespan in both sexes but in a dose-dependent manner, where strong expression is deleterious for lifespan, whereas moderate-to-weak overexpression increases lifespan (20). 

Extensive research over the past two decades has placed p53 at the hub of a very complex network of signaling pathways that integrate a variety of intracellular and extracellular inputs. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that the opposing effects of various components of the p53 signaling network must be carefully balanced to correctly regulate p53 function and induce the appropriate cellular response (29,30). Under normal conditions, p53 is expressed at a low level and has a short half-life. When cells are exposed to a stressful environment, p53 is activated, resulting in transcriptional regulation of many target genes, including the MDM2 gene. A reduced MDM2-mediated degradation of p53R72 variant compared with p53P72 variant was recently reported (31). Notably, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the MDM2 promoter (SNP309), leading to elevated MDM2 expression and attenuated efficiency of the p53 pathway, is regulated by estrogen signaling (32-34). Interestingly, SNP309 (G/G) seems to have a more significant effect on accelerating tumor formation in a gender-specific (women) and hormonal-dependent manner (35-37). Also, recent results suggest the possibility that SNP309 G allele may contribute to gender-specific tumorigenesis through further elevating the MDM2 levels and disrupting the p53MDM2 oscillation (38). Indeed, a gender-specific gene-gene interaction between the two polymorphisms was found in nonoropharyngeal cancer, where the youngest age at onset was observed in female patients with the combined MDM2 SNP309 G/G and TP53 codon 72 P*/P* genotypes (39). In breast cancer, homozygous carriers of the G-allele in MDM2 had worse survival only within the group of TP53*P72 carriers (25).

In conclusion, the discrepancies among the results obtained on rs1042522 for longevity in different populations could result from the pleiotropic effects of p53 and the potential ethnic variation of its functional variants. The gender-specific association of rs1042522 with life expectancy clearly claims for future investigations. Manipulating p53 expression in mouse models in p53 dose-specific, mouse tissue-specific, developmental stages specific, and sex-specific manners may further shed light on the role of p53 in aging and longevity in mammals (5). Thus, only a wider analysis of genetic and environmental factors influencing the p53 pathway could definitively address the role of p53 protein in human longevity.
