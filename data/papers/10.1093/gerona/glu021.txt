The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is crucial for life span determination in model organisms. The aim of the present study was to test tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms that captured most of the genetic varia- tion across key TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2) genes MToR, RPToR, and RicToR and the important downstream effector gene RPS6Ka1 for association with human longevity (defined as attainment of at least 95 years of age) as well as health span phenotypes. Subjects comprised a homogeneous population of American men of Japanese ancestry, well characterized for aging phenotypes and who have been followed for 48 years. The study used a nested case–control design involving 440 subjects aged 95 years and older and 374 controls. It found no association of 6 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms for MToR, 61 for RPToR, 7 for RicToR, or 5 for RPS6Ka1 with longevity. Of 40 aging-related phenotypes, no significant association with genotype was seen. Thus common genetic variation (minor allele frequency ≥10%) in MToR, RPToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1 is not associated with extreme old age or aging phe- notypes in this population. Further research is needed to assess the potential genetic contribution of other mTOR pathway genes to human longevity, gene expression, upstream and downstream targets, and clinically relevant aging phenotypes.

nutrient-sensing pathways (7,8) and is pivotal to life span extension in response to caloric restriction (9,10). Despite good evidence showing that insulin/insulin-like growth fac- tor-1 and mTOR pathways are critical for life span regula- tion of model organisms (6,11,12), to date, attainment of extreme old age in humans has been consistently replicated only for variation in one gene in these pathways, the fork- head box O transcription factor 3 gene (FoXo3) (5,6).

major causes of death in developed countries. The rate of aging is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Identification of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this complex polygenic phenotype represents a major cur- rent challenge. Because the genetic component becomes paramount for the attainment of extreme old age (1–3) and caloric restriction is the most effective means of extending life span in diverse species (4), studies of polymorphisms in genes belonging to intracellular pathways that are modu- lated by caloric restriction have been conducted in nonage- narian and centenarian populations (4,5). These pathways affect insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling and growth responses. The hyperfunction theory of aging postu- lates that in later life, the once-beneficial processes contrib- uting to growth become deleterious by causing hypertrophic and hyperplastic pathologies (6).

mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase with crucial roles in cell growth and metabolism in response to nutri- ents, growth factors, cellular energy, and stress (6,8,13,14). Rapamycin forms a stoichiometric complex with mTOR to inhibit its kinase activity (15,16) and can thus extend mean and maximum life span of middle-aged male and female mice, with no adverse health consequences, only benefits

The mechanistic (formerly “mammalian”) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is positioned at a central hub of

mTOR is a component of two structurally and func- tionally distinct multiprotein complexes—TOR complex

1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). In mammals, two accessory proteins—regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (raptor or RPTOR) and rapamycin-insensitive com- panion of mTOR (rictor or RICTOR)—distinguish TORC1 from TORC2, respectively (19,20). mTORC1 exerts its effects on temporal control of cell growth by regulating sev- eral cellular processes, including translation, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, nutrient transport, and autophagy (14). The two TOR complexes constitute an evolutionar- ily conserved ancestral signaling network that responds to energy levels and sources of energy in order to control the fundamental process of cell growth and maintenance. In addition to its key role in aging, mTOR has been implicated in cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes (21).

the present study. “Cases” (longevity phenotype) were defined as HHP and HAAS participants who had survived to beyond the upper 1% of the 1910 U.S. birth cohort– specific survival (minimum 95 years of age; n = 440 as of June 2011, 296 having died [age of death = 97.0 ± 2.2 SD; range: 95–106 years]) (28) and 144 still being alive (mean age = 96.3 ± 1.6 SD; range: 95–106 years). Controls consisted of 374 individuals from the HHP and HAAS cohort who had died near the mean for the 1910 U.S. birth cohort–specific survival for middle-aged men (77 years of age). To achieve a case:control ratio of approximately 1:1, the HHP and HAAS study population was sampled for controls who died up to the age of 81 years (mean age at death = 78.1 ± 1.8 SD years [range: 73–81 years]), consistent with the 3.5 years longer life expectancy of Japanese American men in Hawaii (29). Analyses showed no evidence of population stratification in the data set (5). All participants were drawn from records of study participants updated up to June 2011. Archived pheno- typic data and blood samples from Examination 4 of the HHP (1991–1993), which coincided with the commence- ment of the HAAS, were used as the baseline exam for this nested case–control study. We had phenotype data for only 439 cases because one subject did not attend Exam 4. Participants included 3,734 men aged 71–93 years at Exam 4 (mean age: 77.9 ± 4.7 years), representing approx- imately 80% of the survivors from the original HHP (30). Procedures performed were in accordance with institu-

FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), which then binds to and inhibits TORC1 in its complex with raptor (16,22). In contrast, rapamycin does not bind to TORC2. Binding of raptor to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 stimulates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (23) and riboso- mal protein S6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 1 (RPS6KA1). RPS6KA1 is a downstream effector of nutrient-responsive mTOR signaling. It regulates multiple transcription factors, increases cell growth—in part by increasing mTOR signal- ing—and links nutrient availability to aging in organisms as diverse as yeast and mice (24). Rapamycin reduces mTOR- mediated phosphorylation of RPS6KA1 (16), so increas- ing life span and resistance to age-related pathologies, as well as producing gene expression patterns similar to those seen in caloric restriction or pharmacological activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved regulator of the metabolic response to caloric restriction (25).

tional guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kuakini Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants or from family representatives, if participants could not provide consent.

Here we report the results of a genetic association study of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) that provided virtually complete coverage of key mTOR complex genes MToR, RPToR, and RicToR, as well as RPS6Ka1, in long-lived Americans of Japanese ancestry. The study tested for association of these genetic variants with living to more than 95 years of age and with multiple aging-related parameters in these subjects.

Genotyping

Total cellular DNA was isolated from leukocytes using the PureGene system (Gentra Systems) and quantified using PicoGreen staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). SNPs genotyped were from within the gene and from a 5- kb region of DNA flanking either end of the genes MToR, RPToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1. TagSNPs were selected using Haploview, a program that defines a haplotype based on high correlation between the first and last markers and all intermediate markers. Supplementary Figures S1–S4 show the linkage disequilibrium blocks captured by the tagSNPs used. We restricted our selection to SNPs having a minor allele frequency of ≥10% in the Japanese popula- tion (as indicated by the HapMap database: http://hapmap. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; HapMap release 27/phase II + III, Feb 2009 on NCBI B36 assembly, dbSNP b126 – http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). The minimal coefficient of determination (r2) value at which all alleles are to be captured was set to a threshold of .8 for the identification of all tagSNPs. Genotype data were managed through an

Methods

Study Population

We used American men of Japanese ancestry drawn from the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) and Honolulu- Asia Aging Study (HAAS; HHP and HAAS) population. Recruitment, design, and procedures have been outlined in detail elsewhere (26,27). Briefly, recruitment of subjects aged 45–68 years (mean age: 54 years) began on Oahu in 1965–1968. These men have been followed with 12 regular examinations and blood work until the present, or death. A nested case–control design was utilized for

integrated database system sample management-data pro- cessing system that has been proven to be accurate in other successful studies (5). All positive controls on each geno- typing plate were evaluated for consistency. Call rates for markers exceeded 98%.

Genetic association Findings

SNPs for MToR, RPToR, and RicToR were genotyped at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center on the Illumina GoldenGate platform (high-throughput SNP genotyp- ing on universal bead arrays (31)). SNPs for RPS6Ka1 were detected by the TaqMan OpenArray System (Life Technologies). We implemented a series of quality control checks based on the Illumina metrics. For inclusion of data for a SNP, its call rate had to exceed .95 and the Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium p needed to be >.01. Of the 81 tag- SNPs genotyped, all met these criteria and were included. In addition, more than 96% concordance was observed for all SNPs for HapMap samples that were assayed for quality assurance.

The minor allele frequencies of each SNP tested in MToR, RPToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1 in cases and controls are presented in Tables 2–5, together with results of chi-square analyses. Differences that appeared statisti- cally significant for two SNPs in RPToR (rs7225574 and rs2589143) and one SNP in RicToR (rs1239256) were lost after correction for multiple comparisons.

Phenotype–Genotype analyses

Phenotype–genotype comparisons for each SNP with 40 different aging-related phenotypes in cases showed weak associations for 5 of 6 SNPs in MToR, 38 of 61 in RPToR, and 5 of 7 in RicToR prior to correction for multiple test- ing (Supplementary Table S2). In all, 83 genotypic associa- tions were observed with blood pressure (BP) and related clinical phenotypes in the case of 23 of the RPToR SNPs. To complement the case–control analysis, multivariate tests for association of quantitative phenotypes with SNP allele counts (0, 1, and 2) were conducted for phenotypes deter- mined at Exam 1 and Exam 4 using canonical correlation. For BP, the mean of Exam 1 and Exam 2 data (substituting Exam 3 BP values if Exam 2 values were missing) were used. Variables were transformed when necessary to reduce skewness of the residuals from the regression of each phe- notype on age and case–control status. Wilk’s lambda test for association between the Exam 1 variables—log values of systolic and diastolic BP (log(SBP) and log(DBP)), serum cholesterol, body mass index, and log of subscap- ular skinfold thickness, adjusted for age at Exam 1—and case–control status was not significant (p = .29). Similarly, for the Exam 4 variables—grip strength, waist:hip ratio, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting serum glucose, log fasting insulin, log triglyceride level, and log of (101 − CASI [cognitive abilities screening instrument] score), adjusted for age at Exam 4 and case–control status—Wilk’s test was not significant (p = .22). Although we cannot rule out associations between particular age-related phenotypes and individual SNPs, the findings suggest that, overall, the actual number of associations observed did not exceed the expected numbers of associations that might be observed by chance alone.

Statistical analyses

Genotype frequencies of SNPs were evaluated for devia- tion from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The Pearson chi- square test was used to compare cases and controls for difference in genotype frequencies. The 95% confidence intervals for allele frequencies were calculated as described (32). For analyses of phenotypes, linear regression models were used for continuous variables (with log transforma- tion of skewed variables) and logistic regression models were used for categorical variables, to test for associations with genotypes, adjusting for case–control status and age at baseline. The analyses used the SAS statistical package

The more limited set of parameters recorded at Exam 1 (1965–1968) are also shown. Unadjusted data are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Presented are biological characteristics, general health status, disease prevalence, and functional status of long-lived “cases” (longevity phenotype) and average-lived “controls” (average phenotype). The long-lived cases were older, leaner (based on lower waist:hip ratio), had lower plasma glucose level, lower plasma insulin level, better self-rated health, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke) and cancer. The cases appeared better able to walk 0.8 km than controls, but grip strength was similar. Cognitive score was slightly higher in cases. When adjusting for age, the differences between long-lived cases became even starker,

Discussion

The present nested case–control study found no associa- tion of genetic variation in mTOR pathway genes MToR, RPToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1 with longevity (survival to age 95 years or older) in American men of Japanese

notes: The Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) has had 12 full exam cycles since study onset in 1965. Shown are phenotypic variables for long-lived cases and average-lived controls at two exam cycles: HHP Exam 4 (1991–1993), the baseline exam for the present study (ie, when blood was collected for genetic studies and participants were elderly (mean age 76 years; range: 71–93) and Exam 1 (1965–68), when study participants were middle-aged (mean age 54 years; range 45–68). Cases consisted of all Kuakini HHP and Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS) participants (both living and dead) for which DNA had been collected at Exam 4 and who achieved longevity (age ≥95 years) by June 2011, the follow-up period for this nested case–control study.

common genetic variation in these genes in the etiology of achieving extreme old age, at least in the specific population tested. The population used for the present study has proven capable of detecting genetic association with extreme old age in the case of FOXO3 (5), thereby demonstrating it has the capacity to detect an association should one exist, at least for common variants (minor allele frequency ≥10%) as used in the present study. Nevertheless, the possibility

SNPs with odds ratios of 2.0 and greater are expected to be significant at the .05 level in our study, there were actually slightly fewer significant results than expected if genetic variants had no effect.

Because the tagging SNPs we selected provided mal coverage of genetic variability across each gene 5 kb of 5′ and 5 kb of 3′ DNA, taking advantage of disequilibrium, our data appear to exclude a major effect

remains for the existence of one or more polymorphisms not in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs tested or of population-specific variants that could be associated with longevity not present in the current population.

pathway between their long-lived subjects and controls (38). Although there was no difference in expression of the longevity-associated gene FoXo3, nor of MToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1, they did find significantly lower expression of RPToR in both long-lived cases and their offspring. Six other genes also exhibited either higher or lower expres- sion in the long-lived group of subjects. Although it might be possible that some of the expression differences could be caused by polymorphisms in, say, the promoter of these seven genes, they could instead be downstream conse- quences of genetic or other influences on transcription or posttranscriptional mechanisms of the seven genes.

dated for genetic variants and human longevity (34–36). The two genes that have received widespread replication are aPoe and FoXo3, each having been associated with human longevity in more than 10 independent populations and under different study conditions (37). Several other genes have had several replications, and a limited number of others have had one to two replications (37). This paucity of data reflects, in part, the difficulty of obtaining robust populations of suitable study participants who have attained extreme old age and the complexity of human longevity as a phenotype. Therefore, any data, whether positive or nega- tive, is instructive in deciphering the molecular genetic eti- ology of human longevity.

ciated with human longevity, we hypothesized that there may be association with aging-related phenotypes. After correction for multiple testing, no significant association was, however, found between the various genotypes and 40 aging-related biologic, clinical, and functional phenotypes.

The only other comprehensive genetic study of MToR, RPToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1 in human longev- ity involved a population of 417 elderly subjects in the Netherlands (38). Genotype data for SNPs in these genes failed to find any association with longevity. However, this study cannot be directly compared with ours for the fol- lowing reasons: (i) The tagSNPs selected did not provide complete coverage of every gene. (ii) Both the cases (aged >89 years) and controls (aged 55–60 years) were much younger. The relative “youth” of their elderly cohort may explain why no association of variation in FoXo3 was found with longevity in this cohort (38,39), whereas in our cohort, with participants aged older than 95 years (5), a highly significant association was found. The latter finding has been replicated consistently in geographically diverse populations of long-lived cases (generally nonagenarian and centenarians) worldwide (37). The inability to detect an association may be due to the fact that some longevity-asso- ciated alleles become markedly more enriched as the age of longevity cases becomes greater. Although the difference between age 89 years and age 95 years may seem small, only 32% of typical 89-year-old people achieve the age of 95 years and thus the latter age is a much more extreme phe- notype (40). This has important consequences for studies of human longevity. For example, the minor allele frequency of the longevity-associated allele of FoXo3 increases by 42% from the octogenarian years to nonagenarian years (5). Allele frequency is a major determinant of statistical power in genetic studies. Thus, the Dutch cohort likely has signifi- cantly less power to detect genetic variants responsible for extreme old age than the current study. (iii) Cases and con- trols were from different cities, although the authors claim population substructure differences were not detected. (iv) Participants were genotyped at different times at differ- ent centers using different Illumina platforms (38,39,41), which could introduce artifacts into the findings. (v) The

comment. Because we only studied men, it remains to be seen whether genotypes of any of the SNPs tested could be associated with longevity or other aging-related pheno- types in women. In addition, baseline examination findings suggested that the longevity case participants were healthier than controls despite the fact that cases were on average 10.8 years older. The cases possessed significantly better biological and physiological risk factor profiles, less age- related disease, and better physical and cognitive function (Table 1). This lends additional credence to the concept of a “healthy aging” phenotype, whereby certain individuals are somehow able to delay or avoid major clinical disease and disability until late in life.

Our long-lived cases also had metabolic profiles that sug- gested higher insulin sensitivity at younger ages, namely lower waist:hip ratio, lower glucose levels, lower insulin levels, and lower homeostasis model assessment values. This profile clearly has at least some genetic basis because protective variants in FoXo3 were associated with pheno- types that reflect insulin sensitivity in previous work (5,42). Although there was bias in the selection of controls because only their deaths qualified them for control status, this was unavoidable.

An important advantage of the present study is the nested case–control study design, which selects cases and controls from an ongoing cohort study, with longitudinally col- lected data. This has advantages relative to a regular case– control study in that several phenotypes of interest, such as biological and physiological phenotypes, disease preva- lence, and functional status, were obtained by direct clini- cal examination when the participants were younger. This eliminated recall bias, namely, the differential accuracy of recall between cases and controls, because the information was collected from our subjects before case–control status was determined. In contrast, findings from studies of excep- tional survivors, such as centenarians, in which evidence for

heart dysfunction (48). Furthermore, gene expression analysis in calorically restricted mice indicates a potential neuroprotective role for the mTOR signaling pathway (49). Moreover, as mentioned earlier, there are significant differ- ences in the expression of mTOR pathway genes in older ages (38).

(43–45), could have suffered from recall bias; older partici- pants may not have recalled their past medical history pre- cisely, nor their functional status when they were younger, or may have learnt of their condition before self-reporting their exposure history to researchers. In the present study, major diseases were, moreover, adjudicated by a morbid- ity and mortality committee that used performance-based measures of physical and cognitive function to supplement self-reported information.

ies, genome-wide expression studies, and next-generation sequencing, one might question the relevance of candidate gene and pathway analyses such as that adopted in the pre- sent study. Although some headway has been made using data from published genome-wide association studies for 125 diseases and risk factors relevant to mortality in order to obtain a genetic score for time to death (50), finding actual genetic variants would require very large numbers of sub- jects of extreme old age in order for such studies to be suf- ficiently powered to generate a result that is significant at the genome-wide level. Although that particular study confirmed that longevity is a complex and highly polygenic trait, it also suggested that it is not easily explainable by common genetic variants related to diseases and physiological traits. In the largest genome-wide linkage analysis for human longevity, involving 2,118 white nonagenarian sibling pairs in 15 study centers of 11 European countries, 4 regions with significant logarithm of the odds of linkage (Lod) scores were identified (2). Fine mapping and a fixed-effect meta-analysis approach showed that aPoeε4 and aPoeε2 alleles at the ToMM40, aPoe, and aPoc1 locus explained the linkage at 19q13.3– q13.32, confirming the role of APOE as a longevity gene. The authors concluded that linkage results for the other three loci were not explained by common variants, suggesting that rare variants play an important role in longevity. Thus, although case–control studies, such as ours involving much older (>95 years) subjects than these, would seem to have value because longevity genes would be more concentrated in the extremely old, a major limitation is the difficulty of studies such as ours in obtaining sufficiently high numbers of subjects older than 95 years of age to test polymorphisms other than common variants, such as those we tested.

There are several other strengths to our study. First, the candidate genes selected for analysis were chosen a priori based on hypothesis-driven criteria. That is, studies of model organisms of aging using various methods, such as knockouts, have shown that the mTOR pathway is impor- tant for aging and longevity (46). The mTOR pathway and many of its functions appear to be evolutionarily conserved. Second, not only did the study involve a nested case–con- trol design, but it had a high event rate (deaths) during a long period of follow-up, which enhances statistical power. Third, the HHP cohort is a highly homogeneous group of individuals and no population stratification was detected in our study participants (5).

A possible weakness was that cases and controls had an average age difference of 10.8 years, so we cannot com- pletely exclude the possibility of confounding by birth cohort effects. There are several reasons why this is not likely: (i) There was only a 19-year difference in birth year from oldest to youngest participants; (ii) Subgroup analy- ses showed no differences in socioeconomic status (educa- tion and occupation) between cases and controls; and (iii) Contrary to typical cohort studies in which younger cohorts have longer survival, older participants at baseline were the most likely to have lived 95 and more years. Because our study was conducted in only one population, it should be replicated in other populations. Further research should also be directed at effects of the genetic variants with aging of specific organs.

tion between the SNPs in the mTOR pathway genes exam- ined and longevity, it remains possible that variants having a minor allele frequency less than 0.10 or variants in other genes in this pathway could have significant effect(s) on longevity or the health or rate of aging of specific organs or both. This is particularly relevant to a genetic study of the rare phenotype of attainment of extreme old age (>95 years of age in our study). As a result it is possible that at least some of the genetic variants that contribute to this pheno- type are themselves rare or were below the minor allele frequency of 10% threshold we set for selection of SNPs for testing. Further research is needed to examine the asso- ciation of uncommon and rare variants of mTOR pathway genes with longevity. Indeed, disruption of mTOR signal- ing has been associated with sarcopenia (47), and there is evidence that rapamycin treatment can reverse age-related

In conclusion, the present study has found no association of common genetic variation in MToR, RPToR, RicToR, and RPS6Ka1 with living to age 95 or older in American men of Japanese ancestry. Further studies of these and other TOR pathway genes in both sexes and in other populations may be warranted.
