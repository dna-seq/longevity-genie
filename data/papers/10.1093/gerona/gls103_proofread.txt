The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2866164 in the MTP gene has been associated with human longevity but has not been validated by subsequent longevity studies. Using our population of Ashkenazi Jews we find that the MTP CC genotype is significantly overrepresented in centenarians and their offspring compared with controls (p < .05). However when we examined the MTP CC genotype frequency pattern with aging we observed a monotonic decline between ages 55-85 years followed by a dramatic enrichment after age 90 years forming a U-shape pattern (p < .05). Furthermore, the MTP CC genotype was buffered by three validated longevity genotypes (p < .05). This buffering effect was found to confer an enrichment of the MTP CC genotype in centenarians, whereas their absence in CC controls resulted in poorer survivorship (p < .05). Thus, we conclude that MTP CC is a buffered-deleterious genotype and that assessing genotype frequency across aging is essential for discerning longevity from buffered-deleterious genotypes.

Failed to detect any association between MTP and longevity (8-12) and have led several to conclude that the findings of Geesaman and colleagues (6) were confounded by population stratification in control participants. A lipid transfer protein found in the liver and intestine is necessary for the proper assembly of apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons (1). Gene association studies have linked haplotypes and SNPs in the MTP gene with several diseases and risk factors including fatty liver disease (2), atherosclerotic risk factors (3), type 2 diabetes (4), and blood pressure (5). In light of its pleiotropic effects and harmful associations with many diseases, it was not surprising that MTP also surfaced as one of the first genes linked to exceptional human longevity (6).

Because most humans die between ages 60 and 100 years, with fewer survivors populating each successive decade, one may assume that a monotonic trend (increase or decrease) in genotype prevalence with age suffices to discern potential beneficial longevity genes from deleterious genes. In the absence of other diseases, such a trend could provide a unique opportunity for genetic analysis of longevity. Indeed, a monotonic increase in genotype frequency with aging suggests that it may confer a survival advantage, as we and others have shown for four genotypes: CETP (VV) [rs5882] (13), APOC3 (CC) [rs2542052] (14), AdipoQ (del/del APM1 +2019) [rs56354395] (15), and most recently, FOXO3a (16, 17). Conversely, it is expected that higher prevalence of harmful genotypes in a cohort will result in increasing rates of mortality in that cohort, leading to a monotonic decline in deleterious genotype frequency over time. However, it has been observed that centenarian populations are carriers of some variants of deleterious genes, even at levels comparable to or greater than younger control groups (18, 19).

Using sibpair analysis on centenarians and their siblings, Puca and colleagues (7) performed the first genomic screening for exceptional human longevity and reported linkage with a region on chromosome 4. Fine mapping of the candidateMedian age was 97 years for 64 men and offspring (n=145 total, 80 women, median age=69 years and 65 men, median age=68 years) and 288 Ashkenazi Jews (167 women, median age=74 years and 121 men, median age=75 years) who were not related to the earlier participants but from the same geographic area. The study population was identified from the Longevity Genes Study at Albert Einstein College of Medicine as described elsewhere (13,14), and the Einstein Aging Study, a community-based longitudinal study designed to identify predictive factors for cognitive decline and dementia (20,21). Participants were recruited through publicity and stated age was verified by checking birth certificates or U.S. passports in all participants. Medical history, demographic characteristics, and clinical data were obtained uniformly using a structured U-Shape Trend Analysis by means of a log-rank test. Wilcoxon statistics were calculated to test homogeneity between groups, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis. The average time of follow-up for participants was 8.5 ± 0.3 and 8.7 ± 0.3 years for the buffered and unbuffered groups, respectively. Approximately 70% of the buffered groups and 64% of the unbuffered groups were still alive at the time of the analysis. In order to determine whether the MTPCC SNP is a buffered-deleterious genotype, we utilized the Buffering Mechanisms in Aging approach, whose statistical considerations are described in detail elsewhere (18). Briefly, controls and probands were grouped together, and a generalized linear model was used to fit the pattern of CC genotype prevalence with age. We confirmed the existence of a significant U-shape pattern with age using a binomial model incorporating both linear and quadratic terms for age and testing for the significant quadratic component using the equation: P(Y=1) = b + b age + b age^2, where Y = 1 was indicative of an individual having the MTPCC genotype. Maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficients b, b, and b were then obtained by the Fisher's scoring method, and the significance of the quadratic term (i.e., U-shape trend) was confirmed using the likelihood ratio test prior to performing interaction analysis on the MTPCC genotype.

Results:
Participant characteristics for aging cohorts from http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/ at Ondokuz Mayis University on November 9, 2014 offspring and Ashkenazi controls are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences observed between offspring and controls for glucose, insulin, apolipoproteins, LDL-C, or LDL particle size. Offspring did have greater levels of TG (p<.001) and tended to have elevated chylomicrons (p=.06), VLDL-TG (p=.06), and total cholesterol (p=.09), as compared with controls. However, offspring also had greater total unadjusted HDL-C (p<.01) and smaller HDL particle size (p<.001), though HDL-C was no longer significant after adjusting for several covariates.

Buffering Analysis:
Upon confirmation of a significant U-shape trend for the CC genotype in controls and probands, we then combined all offspring and control participants (excluding probands) harboring the CC genotype and subgrouped them by presence or absence of one or more longevity genotypes, including CETP (homozygosity for the 405 V allele, VV) [rs5882] (13), APOC3 (homozygosity for the 641 C allele, CC) [rs2542052] (14), and ADIPOQ(del/del APM1+2019) [rs56354395] (15). We next performed logistic regression to test the interaction between the trend of the MTPCC genotype across age with or without the presence of favorable longevity genotypes. Because we did not detect any additive effect of harboring more than one favorable genotype, any carrier of one or more of the three longevity genotypes were combined as a single group. To test the significance of interaction effects between age and genotype, the model testing for main effect only and the model testing for the interaction effects were compared using the log-likelihood ratio test.

MTP Genotype and Allele Frequency in Centenarians, Offspring, and Controls:
The prevalence of the MTP rs2866164 SNP and genotype frequency among centenarians, offspring, and controls are presented in Figure 1A and B, respectively. As compared with Ashkenazi controls, the CC genotype was more prevalent in both centenarians and their offspring (p<.05, Figure 1A), but no significant differences were observed in CG or GG genotype prevalence among groups. When assessing allele frequency in all three groups,Life but was followed by a marked enrichment to near 60% by 90 years of age (Figure 3B), as predicted by the buffering hypothesis (18). Discussion: Here, we show that the prevalence of the MTP CC genotype is enriched in centenarians and their offspring, as compared with Ashkenazi Jew controls. Paradoxically, this genotype was associated with an unfavorable lipid profile, including greater concentrations of TG, VLDL, and chylomicrons, all known risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This paradox between phenotype and genotype is explained by the fact that the MTP CC genotype demonstrated a monotonic decline with aging until ~80 years of age, followed by a marked increase in centenarians, forming a U-shape pattern with aging. Offspring and individuals belonging to the control group with the MTP CC genotype across ages were then categorized by presence or absence of one or more known longevity genotypes {CETP (VV) [rs5882] (13), APOC3 (CC) [rs2542052] (14), and AdipoQ (del/del APM1+2019) [rs56354395] (15)}. Absence of these genotypes resulted in a monotonic decline in CC prevalence to near 0% by 90 years, whereas a sharp rise in prevalence was observed in those harboring longevity genotypes beyond 80 years old. Finally, we show that control and offspring without any of the three favorable longevity genotype variants but possessing MTP CC genotype and Survivorship in Ashkenazi Offspring and Controls Kaplan Meier curves comparing survivorship between MTP genotypes are presented in Figure 4A and B. As compared with Ashkenazi offspring and controls with either CG/GG genotypes, those with the CC genotype demonstrated significantly worse survival (p < .05, Figure 4A). Table 2.

HDL = high-density lipoprotein; LDL = low-density lipoprotein; VLDL = very low-density lipoproteins. p Values between CC carriers and CG/GG carriers adjusted for age and sex (glucose [mg/dL], insulin [mg/dL],We conclude that the CC genotype is not a longevity gene, despite its relative enrichment in Ashkenazi probands. Contrary to prior observations, the pattern of genotype frequency during aging shows that CC genotype prevalence begins to decrease at ages where the mortality rate is expected to increase (Figure 3A). However, individuals approaching exceptional old age show a marked enrichment in the CC genotype. This is not because this genotype suddenly becomes beneficial, but rather due to the buffering effect of longevity genotypes, which are also becoming enriched (Figure 3B). 

For example, comparing only case-control analysis between 60-year-old individuals and centenarians in our study, which are on opposite ends of the U-shape, would show that gene variants involved in lipoprotein metabolism play an important role in healthy aging and longevity. 

In summary, we show that enrichment of the MTP CC genotype in centenarians and their offspring, relative to controls, is misleading unless the pattern in genotype frequency during aging is observed. The CC genotype demonstrates all the hallmarks of a buffered-deleterious genotype. We also demonstrate that a functional consequence of the CC genotype in controls without longevity genes includes poorer survivorship. Finally, this study is a vital proof of concept for the importance of populating the age axis as well as accounting for buffering mechanisms when attempting to discern longevity genotypes from deleterious genotypes.
