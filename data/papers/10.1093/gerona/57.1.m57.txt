Background. Longevity can be regarded as a multifactorial trait that results from an interaction between environ- mental factors and sets of epistatic alleles that have pleiotropic age-dependent effects. The Hotan district in the Xin Jiang Uighur Autonomous region of China is relatively isolated and is well known for an ethnic group that displays marked longevity.

Methods. We performed a correlation study between the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) gene and longevity by comparing distributions of the polymorphism between three different ethnic groups in this region. We obtained data from 424 subjects comprising 227 Uighur individuals, 108 Kazakh indi- viduals, and 89 Han individuals. All subjects in the latter two groups ranged in age from 65 to 70 years, whereas the Ui- ghur subjects actually comprised two different age groups: those ranging in age from 59 to 70 years (Uighur older group in Hotan [UOH]) and those ranging in age from 90 to 113 years (Uighur longevity group in Hotan [ULH]). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells. Polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify the I/D polymorphic region of the ACE gene.

Results. Frequencies of the insertion (I) and deletion (D) alleles were 0.596 (243/408) and 0.404 (165/408) in the Ui- ghur group, 0.606 (130/216) and 0.394 (85/216) in the Kazakh group, and 0.657 (117/178) and 0.343 (61/178) in the Han group. The overall distributions of alleles in these three groups did not differ significantly ((cid:2)2  4.6, p   .33). Within the Uighur group, frequency of the D allele was significantly higher in the ULH group (0.448) than in the UOH group (0.355) (p  .04).

Conclusions. This association reflects a genetic influence on differential survival and may point to pleiotropic age- dependent effects on longevity. Our data may help elucidate the relationship between natural longevity and race differ- ence among individuals in the Xin Jiang Uighur Autonomous region of China.

ACE occurs in intron 16 (9). The insertion (I) allele con- tains a 287 bp Alu repeat sequence, whereas the deletion (D) allele lacks the Alu sequence. The D allele of the ACE gene has been associated with myocardial infarction (MI) (10–12), cardiomyopathy (13,14), left ventricular hypertro- phy (15), and coronary risk in noninsulin-dependent dia- betic patients (16). In some studies, elevated ACE levels were associated with the D allele (11,17,18). Although as- sociations between ACE polymorphism and cardiovascular diseases have been elucidated in many studies, they are neither strong nor consistent in all populations. Also, the allelic frequencies of the ACE gene vary between racial and ethnic groups. More surprising is the increased fre- quency of the ACE/D allele found in association with lon- gevity (19). In this study, we made a correlation between the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and longevity by comparing distributions of the polymorphism between three ethnic groups, one of which is characterized by lon- gevity, as well as that in control subjects.

mous region of China is a relatively isolated area and is well known for an ethnic group that displays marked lon- gevity, a group known as the Uighur (1–3). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), one of the constituents of the renin-angiotensin system, has attracted attention in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular dis- ease is a multifactorial disease in which genetic and envi- ronmental factors play important roles. These factors may differ according to race or ethnic group. A number of stud- ies have suggested various risk factors in association with cardiovascular diseases (4). Because it modulates the pro- duction of angiotensin II and the catabolism of bradykinin, ACE is implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease. Plasma ACE levels are variable between individu- als (5,6). Furthermore, levels of plasma ACE are consid- ered to be under genetic control. The gene encoding human ACE has been cloned and assigned to chromosome 17q23 (7,8). The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism at the

Materials

We obtained data from 424 individuals comprising three races. Subjects were recruited from the Hotan (south Xin Jiang) and Balkun (north Xin Jiang) districts by random se- lection of resident cards (in a local government office). A total of 227 Uighur individuals and 38 Han individuals were recruited from Hotan. The Uighur subjects ranged in age from 59 to 113 years, and the Han subjects ranged in age from 65 to 70 years. One hundred eight Kazakh individuals and 51 Han individuals were recruited from Balkun. Both the Kazakh subjects and the Han subjects ranged in age from 65 to 70 years. The Hotan Uighur subjects were di- vided into two groups, those aged 59 to 70 and those aged 90 and older. Those aged 90 and older were termed the Ui- ghur longevity group, and those aged 59 to 70 were used as a control group (Table 1). All subjects underwent a general physical examination. Blood samples were collected to con- firm general health and to prepare DNA.

DNA Analysis

We extracted genomic DNA from citrated whole-blood pe- ripheral white blood cells by a modification of previously de- scribed methods (20). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the I/D polymorphic region of the ACE gene as previously described (21). The sense primer was 5’- CTGCAGACCACTCCCATCCTTTCT-3, and the antisense primer was 5’-GATGTGGCCATCACATTCGTCAGAT-3’. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: initial dena-  nice4° turation at 94 C for 3 minutes followed by 30 cycles at 94 C vi3°C AE2°C for 30 seconds, 63 C for 1 minute, 72 C for 1 minute, and a ~ aN2°C final extension at 72 C for 10 minutes. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel (Fig- ure 1). Allele frequencies for each group were calculated by chi-square analysis on contingency tables.

((cid:2)2   4.05, p  .04) (Table 3). These results are similar to those previously reported (D allele more frequent in cente- narian than in control: p WEr<. .01) (16).

D ISCUSSION

The genotypes and I/D allele polymorphism of the ACE gene have been reported at different frequencies in different races. The I allele of the ACE gene has a reported frequency of approximately 0.47 in Caucasians (22,23). Barley and col- leagues (23) reported a considerably higher I allele frequency of 0.91 in Polynesian (Samoan) and 0.85 in South American native (Yanomami) populations. The frequency of the I allele in healthy Korean subjects (0.58) was very similar to that in healthy Japanese subjects (0.59) (18,24) and fell between the frequencies reported for Caucasians, Samoans, and Ya- nomami. In our study, there were no marked differences in ge- notype or allele frequencies between the three racial groups, and the frequency of the I allele (0.645) was closer to that of the Koreans and Japanese than that of the Caucasians, Samo- ans, or Yanomami. It is possible, though only speculative, that this may reflect a similarity among Asians in general.

R ESULTS

The frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the I/D poly- morphism of the ACE gene in the three races are shown in Table 2. There were no significant differences between the groups in the overall distribution of genotypes ((cid:2)2  4.6, p   .33) and alleles ((cid:2)2   1.3, p aaa. .51). Frequencies of the I and D alleles were 0.645 (156/242) and 0.355 (86/242), re- spectively, in the control group and 0.552 (117/212) and 0.448 (95/212), respectively, in the Uighur longevity group

The differences in the ACE polymorphism between pop- ulations may be due to differences in genetic background

arising from genetic drift and a founder effect or from a se- lection process. The D allele has been associated with pre- mature coronary artery disease, cardiac hypertrophy, rela- tively rapid progression of chronic renal disease, stroke, and coronary restenosis after stent placement. The association between MI and ACE polymorphism among westerners might be a consequence of linkage disequilibrium between neutral mutations and a significant cardiovascular allele of the ACE gene. Nevertheless, not all investigators have found an increased risk associated with the D allele (25). In fact, the D allele occurred more frequently in a group of 100-year-old individuals than would otherwise be expected. How are these divergent findings, a “bad” and “good” effect of a single mutation, to be reconciled? One possibility may be related to differing genetic methodologies, unrealistic as- sumptions, and divergent populations. For instance, the Ca- nadian Inuit population, an endogenous native people, has a much lower rate of heart disease than do non-native popula- tions. Hegele and colleagues tested the possibility of a genetic basis for this by examining five different gene polymorphisms previously associated with the risk of car- diovascular disease, namely ACE, angiotensinogen, intesti- nal fatty acid binding protein, paraoxnase, and the apolipo- protein E gene (26). Interestingly, the Inuit population features a predominance of the “bad” polymorphism for four of the genes. In the case of ACE, they had a predomi- nance of the “good” I polymorphism in comparison with the non-Inuit control group who showed a predominance of the D allele. Predominance explaining “good” and “bad” at- tributes is likely to become increasingly important.

more frequent in French centenarians than in controls; the D allele as well as increased serum ACE activity were also more frequent in centenarians. Similar results were reported by Baltes and colleagues: analysis revealed a significantly increased frequency of the D/D genotype in an elderly Ger- EN >8 man group (age 80 years) (29). Interestingly, both of these groups were Caucasians. They are distinguished from our subjects in ethnicity, but the findings were similar.

These comparative studies of the ACE polymorphism demonstrate the importance of using a homogeneous popula- tion for the selection of study subjects, making possible more exact estimations of the distributions of ACE genotypes among racial groups. The I/D polymorphism frequencies re- ported in various populations are not conclusive. Studies of longevity in other racial or ethnic groups, such as South or Central Asians, North or South Americans, and Africans, will be of great interest. The associations we found provide exam- ples of genetic influence on differential survival and may point to pleiotropic age-dependent effects on longevity rather than to a significant difference in the distribution of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism between our three ethnic groups.

The D allele frequency was significantly higher in our longevity group than in elderly subjects of the same ethnic background. This reflects a genetic influence on differential survival and may point to pleiotropic age-dependent effects on longevity. Our data may help to elucidate the relation be- tween natural longevity and race among individuals in the autonomous Xin Jiang region of China and also inform fu- ture study of the relation between the ACE gene I/D poly- morphism and cardiovascular disease.

Our results support this finding, and it is interesting in view of its reported association with MI. Perhaps the risk conferred by the I/D allele is offset by some unknown long- term protective effect that appears to be unrelated to blood pressure and hypertension in adults (11,17). However, the protective effect may arise during old age, which might then explain increased blood pressure as a positive survival fac- tor for longevity. ACE activity has been related not only to the cardiovascular control system but also to the immune system (27). Further studies are needed to understand the role of ACE outside the cardiovascular system. Faure- Delanef and colleagues (28) found the D/D genotype to be
