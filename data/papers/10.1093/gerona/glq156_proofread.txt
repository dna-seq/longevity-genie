Based on data from 760 centenarians and 1060 middle-age controls (all Han Chinese), this article contributes to biodemographic independent and joint effects of the genotypes of FOXO1A and FOXO3A genes on long-term survival while considering gender differences in the independent effects. Positive effects of FOXO3A and negative effects of FOXO1A largely come into effect when considering the carrying effect on FOXO3A-310 or FOXO3A-292 decrease survival likelihood by 32% to 36% (p < .05), whereas carrying FOXO1A-209 and regular exercise increase survival likelihood by 31% to 32% (p < .05).

The genotypes of FOXO1A (rs2755209 and rs2755213) were found to be negatively associated with longevity in women (OR = 0.70 and 0.71, p = .007 and .015; dominant model), whereas in the dominant model for men, FOXO1A-rs2755213 is marginally and negatively associated with longevity (OR = 0.65, p = .025) and the association of FOXO1A-rs2755209 is not significant (OR = 0.73, p = .093). One SNP (rs17630266) from FOXO1A was found not to be associated with longevity. The negative association of FOXO1A with female longevity was replicated in 350 centenarians and 350 younger individuals who were sampled in a geographically distinct region.

FOXO1A and FOXO3A gene variants have also been linked to longevity in the Framingham cohort in the United States (7) and in the Leiden85-plus study (8). In her most recent Nature review article, Kenyon stated that the reason why FOXO variants are so consistently associated with longevity is perhaps because FOXO proteins act on many pathways to affect lifespan (9). In vivo, FOXO1A and FOXO3A regulate a group of genes expression, such as TRAIL, ApoC3, angiopoietin-2, ENOS, Agrp, pomc, FasL.

AKT1-FOXO-mediated signaling pathways significantly affect the maximum life process of FOXO in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Does carrying FOXO genotypes influence longevity in opposite directions, and if yes, what are the direction and size of the effects?

Materials and Methods

Data Sources

578 female centenarians and 182 male centenarians survived to age 100+ when they participated in the inter-examinations involving ordinary people. These 760 centenarians and the 1060 middle-age controls were all from Southern China (China is traditionally and culturally referred to as a single region, but there is no legitimate or official administrative meaning to this division). Among the 22 provinces where CLHLS was previously estimated, the frequencies of genetic variants between long-lived individuals and younger adults were found to be more frequent in centenarians than in 90+ and colleagues (6) on which our current study was produced by and described in the genetic analysis.

FOXO1A gene and the three SNPs rs2253310, rs2755209, rs2755213, and 3A-936, respectively.

The Extended10 still survived in the 2008 wave. The cohort follow-up data on survival and death, socioeconomics, lifestyle, psychological characteristics, and health status, etc. of the participants used in the multivariate statistical survival analysis in this article are from the CLHLS conducted in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005, and 2008 using questionnaires that followed the international standards adapted to the Chinese cultural context (19). The careful evaluations (such as reliability coefficients and factor analysis) have shown that the data quality of the CLHLS surveys was reasonably good (19).

We use the centenarians' age at death (or age in 2008 for the 10 centenarians who survived in the 2008 follow-up survey) in our case-control analysis. The mean age of the male and female centenarian samples were 101.9 and 103.2, respectively. The mean ages of the male and female controls were 46.0 and 45.4, respectively. Similar to the previously published studies on association between the FOXO genotypes and longevity (28), the centenarians and middle-age controls of this study are ethnically (all Han Chinese) and geographically (Southern China) compatible, and thus the where p(x) is the proportion of individuals who are x years old and have the fixed attribute.

Zeng and Vaupel (22) derived Formula (1) and empirically justified it. Note that Formula (1) provides estimates of the general impacts of one genetic variant on survival from age x to x+n, regardless of carrying or not-carrying another relevant genetic variant. We extend the FAD method here to provide formulas to estimate the independent effect of a genetic variant in the absence of another relevant genetic variant, the joint effects when both are present, and the effects of interactions between them.

Let i = 0, 1 represent not-carrying and carrying hereafter; and j as not-exposed and exposed hereafter. Let p11 be the proportion of x-year-old individuals who are a carrier and not-exposed, p10 and p01 are non-carrier and not-exposed, and neither carrier nor exposed. Note that the sum of p11, p10, p01, and p00 of FOXO3A and whether carrying the minor allele of 1A-209, and the estimates of the odds ratios of survival probability (RS ij/00) from middle age to ages 100+ measuring the independent and joint effects of the genotypes.

If the OR of survival RS ij/00 smaller than 1.0, the ij combination of the gene-fixed exposure is positively or negatively associated with longevity. The frequency distribution of the genotypes defined by combinations of whether carrying the minor allele of one of the three SNPs of FOXO3A and whether carrying the minor allele of 1A-213, and the estimates of the odds ratios of survival probability (RS) from middle age to ages 100+ measuring the independent and joint effects of the genotypes are shown in Table 2.

The mathematical and demographic derivation is presented in Appendix 1: p-values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (23) can be performed to assess whether the estimates of an OR of survival (RS in Formula (1) and RS in Formula (2)) is significantly different from 1.0, using a simple procedure in standard statistical software (e.g., STATA, SAS, or SPSS). Note that RS10/00, RS01/00, and RS11/00 represent the independent impact of the genetic variant (or another fixed exposure) on survival from age x to x+n in the absence of another fixed exposure (including genetic variant), and that RS11/00 represents the joint impact of the genetic variant and the fixed exposure on survival from age x to x+n when both of them are present.

The basic and extended FAD methods are based on the fundamental demographic insight that the prevalence of a fixed attribute (e.g., genetic variant, birth weight, childhood conditions, and serious disease(s) suffered earlier in life) and combinations of two fixed attributes in a population can change with age, even though no individual can change his or her variant. Therefore, much can be learned about the impact of the fixed attribute (including genetic variant) and the combinations of the fixed attributes on survival.

In Formula (2), individuals are identified as carriers or non-carriers, and a carrier could have 1 or 2 copies of the minor allele of the SNPs in the application of our present study.study. Hence, we are implicitly assuming that the minor allele is dominant rather than recessive or additive. A modified version of the FAD approach and application is required to analyze recessive or additive models. Gene-environment interaction (GE) is defined as a different effect of an environmental exposure on disease and health risk in persons with different genotypes, or alternatively, a different effect of a genotype on disease and health risk in persons with different environmental exposures (24, 25). Similarly, gene-gene interaction (GG) is defined as a different effect of a genotype on disease and health risk in persons with and without another genotype. Applying the standard definition and method for estimating the GE or GG interactions (25), we present in Appendix 2 the procedures for estimating the effects of gene-fixed exposure interactions on survival from age t to x + n, using the ORs of survival (RS,i=0,1;j=0,1) derived by ij/00 Formula (2). For cases and younger controls, the estimates of the logistic regression not adjusted for mathematical proof and the empirical evidence, regression without controlling for covariates are not presented here due to space limitation but available upon request. This fact verifies the statistical property that much the probability of survival from age t to x + words, the FAD method provides clearer interpretations and presents meaningful syntheses of the case-control genetic analysis on longevity. As the two approaches produce exactly the same formulas (1) and (2) can be used to analyze cross-sectional data from different cohorts of long-lived cases and younger controls or follow-up data from the same cohort. In the case of analyzing the cross-sectional data, we actually connect the younger cohort and the long-lived cohort into what the demographic textbooks call a hypothetical cohort and estimate the OR of survival based on proportions of the genetic variant and fixed exposure among the long-lived and younger cohorts (i.e., at advanced and younger ages in the hypothetical cohorts).

It is important to note that if one uses cross-sectional data, both the FAD method expressed in Formulas (1) and (2) and the conventional case-control statistical genetic approach assume that the initial distributions of the genetic variant, the fixed exposure, and their combinations, and their association with longevity do not differ substantially between cohorts of long-lived individuals and younger controls, that is, there is no substantial problem of population stratification (see more detailed discussions in Appendix 1 on potential bias if this basic assumption is violated). If cohort follow-up data are used, one needs to assume that the loss to follow-up from age t to x + n is not correlated with respondents' combination of the genetic variant and the fixed exposure under study. Serious attention must be paid to this issue in applying either the conventional statistical genetic approach or the FAD method for identifying genetic contributions to longevity.

To control for population stratification in the FAD analysis in this article using the cross-sectional data of centenarians and middle-age controls, we have restricted our analysis to a single ethnic group (Han Chinese) residing in Southern China, and classified the samples by gender as well. The standard method of survival analysis using cohort follow-up data is limited because it requires prospective tracking of the mortality of study participants, with a follow-up period for estimating long-term survival probabilities that may be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming (26). The FAD method circumvents this major limitation of standard survival analysis because it does not require expensive follow-up mortality data of study participants, and it can be applied to both cohort and cross-sectional datasets if the basic assumption of no serious problems of population stratification is met. However, the FAD method has a major limitation: it permits an analysis to ascertain the de facto association of a fixed attribute (including genes) or the combination of gene-fixed exposure on longevity while usually controlling for age and sex. In theory, we can further control for other covariates by extending the FAD method through cross-tabulations of the study participants by confounding factors that are also fixed attributes and meet the assumption of no substantial problem of population stratification, but this may cause problems with small sample sizes of the subgroups. Thus, we applied both FAD methods and multivariate statistical modeling approaches whenever possible to complement each other and to maximize the utility of the available data sources.

Note that the statistically significant estimates of the proportional hazard models analysis represent the significant gene-environment correlations (rGE) and gene-gene correlations. Significant gene-environment effects with a continuous environmental variable discovered in the Cox for differences in means of continuous environmental factors between the gene carriers and non-carriers. For all significant gene-environment synergistic effects with discrete environmental variable and for all significant gene hazards models analysis, we use the chi-squared test to assess the genotype frequency difference across the environmental test. We will need to conduct path analysis employing multivariate regression analysis or structural equation modeling, adjusted for various confounding factors, to significant genotype effects that work through environmental factors and the significantModels as Covariates in a Forward Stepwise Analysis

Results based on the sequential models are presented to show how the effects of genotypes on survival may be mediated by different confounders. We also tried to estimate the effects of all possible gene-environment interactions (GE) and gene-gene interactions (GG) terms in the Cox proportional hazards models.

General Effects of the Genotypes of FOXO1A and FOXO3A on Long-term Survival Probability From Middle Age to Age 100+

The probability of survival from middle age to age 100+, regardless of carrying the minor allele of any other four SNPs of FOXO1A FOXO3A. The results show that, as compared with non-carriers, the probability of survival from middle age to age 100+ for women who are carriers of the minor alleles of the 1A-209 and 1A-213 are 30% and 29% lower than those who are non-carriers, and the estimates are statistically significant. Those men who carry the minor alleles of 1A-209 and 1A-213 may have 27% and 35% lower probability of survival from middle age to age 100+, but the estimate for 1A-209 is not statistically significant and the estimate for 1A-213 is moderately significant (p = .025) (Table 1). As compared with non-carriers, the OR of survival for women and men who carry the minor alleles of 3A-310, 3A-292, and 3A-936 are 1.62-1.67 (p = .0002~.0004) and 1.61-1.73 (p = .001~.005), respectively. These estimates of the general effects imply that, on average, middle-aged women and men who carry the minor allele of any one of the three SNPs of FOXO3A may have 62%-67% and 61%-73% higher probability of survival from middle age to age 100+, and all of the estimates are highly statistically significant.

The negative and independent effects of carrying the minor allele of 1A-209 on survival in women are all highly significant (p < .001), and the independent effects of 1A-213 in women are moderately (p = .029-.043) or marginally (p = .052-.066) significant. The estimates of the independent effects for men who carry the minor allele of 1A-209 or 1A-213 are not significant. The estimates of the joint effects show that carriers of both the minor allele of 1A-213 and non-carriers of the minor allele of the 3A-292 are not significant, and non-carriers of the minor allele of the 1A-213 and carriers of the minor allele of the 3A-936 is only marginally significant (p = .052-.066). These estimates of the independent and joint effects are consistent with those reported in the previous publication (6).

The Independent and Joint Effects of the Genotypes of FOXO1A and FOXO3A on Long-term Survival From Middle Age to Age 100+

The analyses concerning FOXO1A presented in Table 1, employing Formula (1) of the FAD method and in previous relevant studies following the conventional genetic and statistical approach (6), are based on comparing the frequencies of carrying the minor allele of the SNPs of FOXO1A (regardless of whether carrying the minor allele of the SNPs of FOXO3A) between centenarians and younger controls. So are the analyses concerning FOXO3A presented in Table 1 and in the previous studies (27). Although they are useful in exploring the general impacts of one genotype on longevity regardless of carrying or not-carrying the other relevant genotype, these analyses cannot reveal the independent, joint, and interactive effects of the genotypes of FOXO3A and FOXO1A, which influences survival in opposite directions.

In men, the patterns of the independent effects of FOXO1A and FOXO3A are substantially different from those of women. As compared with men who are non-carriers, carriers of the minor allele of one of the two SNPs of FOXO1A and FOXO3A are all non-significant (see the panels for the general effects). Applying our extended FAD method expressed in Formula (2), we found that carriers of the minor allele of one of the three SNPs of FOXO3A, with the reference to non-carriers, have positive independent effects (RS > 1) on survival at very advanced ages (92-110), adjusted for all confounders. The estimates of RS range from .618 to .643. To avoid the problems of multicollinearity, we should not include more than one SNP of FOXOPotentially confounding and how we estimated these 15 potentially confounding factors - FOXO3A genes are not correlated with each other. How- ever, including GG of 1A-209 and one of three SNPs of FOXO3A, or including GG of 1A-213 and one of three SNPs of FOXO3A, or excluding GG and GE, or including both GG and GE with sign.GE, the relative hazards of the genotypes, the GG (gene-gene), and the significant GE (gene-environment) interactions on survival likelihood at very advanced ages are presented in Table 4.

We are also not able to interpret why the negative effects of FOXO1A on long-term survival from middle-age to age 100+ found in the cross-sectional case-control analysis diminished at very advanced ages (92-110) in the cohort survival analysis; it is not clear why there are substantial gender differences in the independent effects of the genotypes of FOXO1A and FOXO3A on probabilities of survival from middle age to ages 100+ discovered by us. The biological, epigenetic, and environmental mechanisms by which FOXO genes' GG combinations and interactions and GE interactions may affect human longevity at old ages are not investigated in our present biodemographic analysis but are warranted in future interdisciplinary research (27-30). For example, a further study needs to investigate how GE interaction between 1A-209 and regular exercise is translated into physiological effects on cellular responses that may significantly increase survival likelihood at advanced ages. More replication analyses and further biological functional study plus demographic-social research using genotypic and longitudinal phenotypic data may provide stronger scientific evidence and explanations for the findings presented in this article.

Third, we presented unique estimates of the genetic influence of FOXO1A and FOXO3A and their GG interactions on survival at very advanced ages, adjusted for various potentially confounding factors, using prospective cohort data. We found that the positive effects of FOXO3A on survival from middle age to ages 100+ remain statistically significant at very advanced ages, but the corresponding negative effects of FOXO1A disappear. We also discovered that the interactions between 1A-209 and 3A-310 and between 1A-209 and 3A-292 significantly decrease the survival likelihood at very advanced ages by 33%-36%.

Fourth, this is the first study that investigates the impacts of GE interactions between the FOXO genes and social-behavioral factors on survival at very advanced ages. Our new finding that GE interaction between the SNP 1A-209 and regular exercise significantly increases the survival by 31%-32% (p < .05) at very advanced ages may have important policy and practical relevance. There are further areas of study and unanswered questions that need to be explored further.

One limitation is that, as we stated in The Extended Fixed Attribute Dynamics Method section and expressed mathematically in Formulas A4 and A5 in the Appendix 1, both the FAD method employed in this article to produce the estimates of Tables 1-3 and the conventional case-control statistical genetic approach assume that (a) the initial distributions of the genetic variant and (b) their association with longevity do not differ substantially between cohorts of long-lived individuals and younger controls. However, although restricting our analysis to a single ethnic group (Han Chinese) residing in Southern China and classifying the samples by gender as well may reduce and hopefully minimize the bias, we are aware that there may still be bias because of potential violation of the assumptions (a) and (b); and we do not know to what degree these assumptions may be violated in the real world. This implies that the results of the OR of survival probability from middle age to age 100+ measuring the general, independent, and joint effects of the FOXO genotypes based on data from the cases (centenarians) and controls (middle-age group), presented in Tables 1-3, may be subject to a bias of unknown magnitude because of confounding with birth cohorts of centenarians and middle-age individuals. Similar cautions were also raised in previous studies following the case-control approach (26), and the potential bias needs to be evaluated in the future when more sophisticated cohort follow-up data sources become available. Although Li and colleagues (6) have done the replication analyses on the general effects of FOXO1A on longevity using female samples from Southern and Northern China, we are not able to perform the replication for the independent, joint, and GG interaction effects.

Finally, it is worth noting that, although the genetic effects of FOXO genes on longevity estimated in this article and the other studies (28) are fascinating, we are not able to estimate the proportion of variance in individuals' probabilities of survival from middle age to age 100+ explained by the FOXO genes. This is because the cohort data on outcome of that who (among the members of the middle-age control group) will survive to age 100 required for such variance analysis are not available. However, previous studies on elderly twins have shown that only one-fourth of the differences in individual lifespan are determined by genetic inheritance that involves multiple genes, and the other three-fourths are determined by social, behavioral, and environmental factors (31). Clearly, knowing which genotypes a person carries does not tell whether he or she may survive to age 100. The most important issue is to promote better social and environmental conditions and healthy behaviors thatE. Multivariate survivorship analysis using two cross-sectional samples. Demography.

Appendix 3. Potentially Confounding Factors Included in the Cox Hazards Regression Models: We chose the following variables as relevant covariates based on reviews of previous studies in this field and our understanding of the Chinese social context. Demographic and socioeconomic variables include age, gender, residence (rural vs urban), education (no schooling vs 1 year of schooling; note that two-thirds of the Chinese oldest old aged 80+ reported no schooling), and economic independence (having his or her own retirement wage and/or earnings vs no income).

If ISm or ISa is significantly greater or less than 1, the interaction between the genetic variant and the fixed exposure positively or negatively affects survival from age x to x + n.

The resilience score: The resilience score was constructed based on the more straightforward and simplified definition of resilience specified in Lamond and colleagues (34), namely, resilience connotes the ability to adapt positively to adversity (i.e. ability of coping and adjustment). We selected seven available and relevant items in the demographic study CLHLS to construct the resilience score, which is actually a simplified version (focusing on coping and adjustment) of the resilience index used in the in-depth psychological study (35).

The Deficits Index: The Deficits Index is used as a proxy for biological age, as a predictor of health change, and utilization of health services and has been posited to capture the cumulative deficits of the same. Based on 39 variables that include cognitive function, instrumental activities of daily living, activities of daily physical performance functional limitations, interviewer-reported health, hearing loss, and vision in the past 2 years, and reports of specific chronic in the past year for which a score of 2 was given if the number used to construct the DI is available elsewhere (37).

Health practices: Cigarette smoking was assessed by the following question: Do you smoke regularly at the present time? Response options were no (coded 0) and yes (coded 1). Based on relatively detailed information concerning the frequency, quantities, and types of alcohol consumed, we coded participants as heavy alcohol drinkers (defined as having at least 200g of liquor or 400g of beer per day) (code=1) versus not heavy alcohol drinkers (code=0). Exercise was assessed by the following question: Do you exercise regularly at present time? Response options were yes and no, coded 1 and 0 respectively.

The frequency distributions of the 15 covariates included in our Cox proportional hazards regression models are not presented in this article due to space limitation and are available upon request.
