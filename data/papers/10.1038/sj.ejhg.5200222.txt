The possibility that four loci (REN, THO, PARP, SOD2) are associated with longevity was explored by comparing the genotypic pools of subjects older than 100 years with those of younger subjects matched for sex and geographic area (northern and southern Italy). The markers (all located within the respective gene) were HUMREN4; HUMTHO1; HUMPARP ; SOD2(C/ (gt)845nt T) . In order to reduce the number of genotypes, multiallelic polymorphisms 401nt were recoded as diallelic according to allele size and frequency patterns (small: S, and large: L, alleles). A significant loss of LL homozygous genotypes was found at the THO locus in male but not in female centenarians with respect to matched controls. On the other hand no significant difference was found between case/control genotypic frequencies at REN, PARP, SOD2 loci. The latter loci therefore do not affect inter-individual variability in life expectancy (at least in terms of qualitative variants associated with the tested markers). However, the data is consistent with an association between the THO locus and longevity.

altering the risk of death at various ages.2 One approach to identifying some of these genes is a comparative analysis at candidate loci between gene pools of extremely elderly individuals and younger people from the same population.3 However, in this approach, special attention must be paid to case/control matching. This is particularly important when studies on Italian people are carried out, not only because different genetic components are present in the Italian gene pool,4 but also because migrations from southern

We have therefore planned a research project in which polymorphic markers at candidate loci were compared between centenarians and younger people, whose ancestry in the specific geographic area was checked back as far as the

Four autosomal genes, which code for proteins involved in fundamental metabolic pathways, were chosen as candidate loci. The genes were renin (REN), tyrosine hydroxylase (THO), poly(ADP-ribose) poly- merase (PARP) and superexidodismutase 2 (SOD2).

Materials and Methods

Both centenarians and controls were clinically healthy unre- lated subjects from various socio-economic backgrounds. Birth and residence of each individual in the specific geographic area (northern or southern Italy) was checked back as far as the grandparents' generation. All individuals gave informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.

The REN gene (9 exons; 1q32 chromosome) codes for renin, an aspartylprotease which catalyses the first step of the biosynthetic cascade leading to angiotensin II. An (acag)n repeat polymorphic region5 lies in intron 7 (HUMREN4 marker). The five known alleles, desig- nated from 8 to 12 according to the repeat number (allele 9 is absent in Caucasians), show bimodal frequency distribution, with peaks at 8 and 11 repeats.6

Centenarians Only individuals who were over 100 years old on the day the blood was taken were included in the study. The oldest subject was a 109-year-old woman; 109 subjects (83 females and 26 males) were from northern Italy (Lombardia, Veneto, Liguria, Emilia-Romagna) and 87 subjects (60 females and 27 males) were from southern Italy (Sicilia, Calabria, Campania, Puglia).

codes for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of catecholamines, aminoacid- derived molecules which act both as hormone (adrena- lin) and neurotransmitters (dopamine and noradrena- lin). By alternative splicing of the THO transcript, four types of mRNA are produced, which differ in the inclusion or exclusion of exon 2 in the spliced products.7 Specifically in intron 1 an (aagt)n repeat polymorphism (HUMTHO1) is located,8, with 8 alleles varying from 5 to 11 repeats (two alleles have 10 repeats; one of them, 10-1 allele, lacks a single a). Allele frequency distribu- tion is bimodal, with peaks at 6 and 10-1 repeats.9 HUMTHO1 alleles are in linkage disequilibrium with INS-VNTR alleles10,11 which affect the levels of insulin transcription differently in pancreas12,13 and thymus.14,15

Controls The ages of the control group ranged from 10 to 85 years (median ages 41 and 31 years in northern and southern Italian samples, respectively); 119 subjects (70 females and 49 males) were from northern Italy and 239 subjects (126 females and 113 males) were from southern Italy, from the regions listed above. The individuals aged from 10 to 18 years were children from primary and secondary schools, whilst the others were volunteer donors (chiefly undergraduate students and University staff) invited to take part in the study by an appropriate campaign. A total of eight sub-samples were obtained, arranged by age (centenarians/ controls), sex (males/females) and geographic area (northern/ southern Italy).

DNAs were extracted from blood buffy-coats following standard procedures.

HUMREN4 and HUMTHO1 typings were carried out by PCR co-amplification of the DNA target sequences.9 Alleles were detected by silver staining. Home-made allele ladders were used as size markers. The quality of the ladder was tested by comparison with a standard ladder kindly donated by Dr C Previdere`, University of Pavia. Alleles were designed according to the repeat number.9 PARP polymor- (gt)n845nt phism was typed on PCR-amplified DNA products20 stained by silver. Home-made allele ladders were used as size markers.

The PARP gene (23 exons, 1q41–42 chromosome) codes for a zinc finger nuclear enzyme which is strongly activated by DNA breaks and promotes DNA repair.16 PARP activity is positively correlated with species- specific life span in mammalian species.17,18,19 A (gt)n repeat polymorphism lies in exon 1.20 The known six alleles, designated according to size (85 bp–99 bp size range), show bimodal frequency distribution, with peaks at 85 bp and 93 bp alleles.

(t/c) SOD2 polymorphism was investigated by an 401nt original ARMS-PCR assay. PCR reaction was carried out in a mg5 ul  25 l volume containing 80ng genomic DNA, 0.5 M of a sense primer specific for either c (5'gcaggcagctggctccgac3') or t (5'gcaggcagctggctccgat3') at nucleotide + 401 and an anti- bom) um sense primer (5'acgcctcctggtacttctcc3'), 200 of each dNTP, M 1.5U Taq polymerase, 1 3 Taq polymerase buffer under the

Statistical Analysis

Allele frequencies were computed by counting genes from the observed genotypes and allele frequency distributions were examined. According to allele size and major frequency peaks, each multiallelic system (REN, THO, PARP) was recoded as a diallelic system by grouping the alleles into two classes (small: S and large: L alleles). All the following

LL genotypes was observed in male centenarians (Table 2). The loss was statistically significant Æ (P = 0.004 with = 0.017) in southern Italy and had borderline significance (P = 0.027) in northern Italy. On the contrary, no significant case/control difference was found at loci REN (Table 1), PARP (Table 3) and SOD2 (Table 4). An analysis of interactions between genotypes/sex/geographic area within both the sample selected for longevity and the controls confirmed the peculiarity observed at the THO locus. The geographic factor interacted with genotypic frequencies in controls (P = 0.040) but not in centenarians (P = 0.142), while sex strongly interacted with the genotypic frequencies in centenarians (P = 0.0002) but not in controls (P = 0.083).

approach was the genotypic analysis of individuals selected for longevity and younger people matched for sex and geographic area. Genotypes rather than alleles were considered because of a non-additive variance of the longevity trait26 and because Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was not fulfilled in the sample of southern Italian male centenarians (P = 0.028).

approach to identify the genes that affect inter- individual variability in life-expectancy, but three points should be taken into account. Firstly, the risk of false positive associations caused by confounding heteroge- neity factors. To reduce such a risk, both cases and controls examined in the present study were born and resident in the specific geographic area (northern or

southern Italy) for three generations at least. Fur- thermore, sex-matched cases and controls were com- pared, on the assumption that the effect of a certain gene could vary between males and females (as expected for multifactorial traits) according to sex- specific physiological scenarios. Secondly, the age of the control group. Usually people aged 20–60 years are tested as controls with respect to centenarians, since this age range should minimise the risk of case/control overlap.3 However, this choice introduces selective criteria for the control group which reduce its random- ness. In the present study, whilst a stringent selection was made as to cases (people older than 100 years), the only selection as to controls was the availability of each person to take part in the study. Thirdly, the choice of candidate loci. The loci tested in our study are good

Neither direct comparisons between genotypes (Table 1, Table 3, Table 4) nor three-way analyses revealed significant differences between case/control genotypic pools at REN, PARP, SOD2 loci. Therefore HUMREN4, PARP (gt) and SOD2(c/t) poly- 845nt 401nt morphisms are not markers of longevity. On the other hand positive results were found at the THO locus. The loss of LL genotypes in male centenarians with respect to controls in both southern and northern Italy is evident (Table 2), although statistical significance is borderline in northern Italian males when adjustment for multiple comparison is made. In any case, we agree with Rothman28 that reducing the type 1 error for null

associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. On the other hand, it is well known that the number of males who survive to very old age is much lower than that of females. If a certain genotype is unfavourable to longevity only (or primarily) in males, a gender gap in longevity should ensue. Our results suggest that the THO locus could be one of those which correlate with gender effect in

The finding that the HUMTHO1 marker is asso- ciated with long life expectancy and that such an effect is sex-related gives rise to two questions. Could a tandem-repeat polymorphic region affect life expec- tancy? Why does such an effect occur in males but not in females? As to the first question, HUMTHO1 lies in intron 1. It was proposed7 that secondary structures of the first intron and between first and second introns could affect THO alternative splicings. We might speculate that the variability of HUMTHO1 may play a role in the efficient production of spliced mRNAs. Indeed recent data has shown that the biological role of VNTR alleles of different size may be different.29,30 On the other hand, since HUMTHO1 and INS-VNTR markers are in linkage-disequilibrium and INS-VNTR allele frequencies show a sex-specific age-related trend,31 it may also be that sex-specific age-related variations of the genotypic pool embrace the entire DNA region comprising both THO and INS loci. In our samples at present, we are analysing further markers occurring in the (11p15.5) DNA region in order to clarify this point. As to the second question, we must consider that the effect of a gene on a multifactorial trait depends on the physiological background in which the gene is expressed. Therefore, if the age-related physiological scenario changes in males and females differently, the effect of a certain gene on survival could vary between the sexes.

In conclusion, the data here reported shows that the genotypic pools at THO locus differ between male centenarians and male controls, the LL homozygous genotypes being very rare in centenarians. Further- more, the specificity of the positive association found at the THO locus is validated by the negative findings at REN, PARP and SOD2 loci.
