Introduction

The antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in plasma and has been suggested to be responsible for HDL's ability to prevent oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), thereby conferring protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), one of the main causes of death in the Western world.

Two polymorphisms resulting in amino-acid substitutions, L55M and Q192R, have been described within the coding region of the PON1 gene. Leviev et al identified three common polymorphisms in the promoter region of the PON1 gene and suggested that all three to some extent affected the PON1 level.

Investigating the influence of the two coding sequence polymorphisms on the efficacy of HDLs protection of LDL lipid oxidation, Mackness et al demonstrated that individuals with the PON1 192QQ/55MM genotype were most effective in protecting LDL against lipid oxidation, whereas PON1 192RR/55LL homozygotes were least effective.

Few studies have investigated the impact of PON1 polymorphisms on survival. Heijmans et al found no significant effect of the Q192R and M55L polymorphisms on mortality risk in a 10-year follow-up study of 666 subjects aged 85 years, whereas Bonafe et al reported an increase in the frequency of 55M/192R carriers in 308 centenarians as compared to 579 younger individuals.

In this study, we examined the association between the (cid:1)107C/T, M55L, and Q192R polymorphisms in a sample of Danish subjects aged 47-93 years drawn among participants of three population-based studies. We used the sample both in a cross-sectional design and in a longitudinal follow-up study of 5 years on average. All three polymorphisms were investigated in a total of 1932 individuals, and to confirm positive findings in the initial cohorts, a further 541 subjects aged 93 years were examined.

Materials and Methods

The subjects included in this study were drawn from three major population-based surveys: the Danish 1905 Cohort, which includes all Danes born in 1905; the Longitudinal Study of Ageing Danish Twins (LSADT), including all Danish twins aged 70 years or older; and the Study of Middle-aged Danish Twins (MADT), including Danish twins born between 1931 and 1952. Initially, we genotyped a total of 1932 unrelated individuals (sample 1) previously used for gene-longevity studies. Of these, 724 originated from the 1905 cohort (aged 93 years), and 626 participants were from LSADT and MADT.

DNA was isolated from cheek swabs or blood spots using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The three polymorphisms were detected by a Taqman-based allelic discrimination assay using the following primers and probes: (cid:1)107C/T-sense: 5'-gcccagctagctgcgga-3'; (cid:1)107C/T-antisense: 5'-atcgatgggcgcagaca-3'; (cid:1)107C: 5'-FAM-cgccc- cgcccctccc-3'; 107T: 5'-TET-cccgccccacccctcc-3'; 55M/L-sense: 5'-tttctgttctcttttctggcagaaa-3'; 55M/L-antisense: 5'-gaaaacactcacagagctaatgaaagc-3'; 55M: 5'-FAM-ccattagg- cagtatctccatgtcttcagagcc-3'; 55L: 5'-TET-tccattaggcagtatctc- caagtcttcagagcc-3'; 199Q/R-sense: 5'-ggacctgagcacttttat- ggca-3'; 192Q/R-antisense: 5'-gacaacatacgaccacgctaaacc-3'; 192Q: 5'-FAM-ttinfarction) self-reported in the surveys. The distribution of genotypes did not differ significantly between individuals with and without ischemic heart disease, indicating that the observed effect of the 192Q/R polymorphism on mortality risk is not mediated through its association with ischemic heart disease. No significant associations between mortality risk and the other two polymorphisms were observed in either men or women.There is a nonsignificant increase in the proportion of RR homozygotes in women with ischemic heart disease (11.8%) compared to both men (6.2%) and women (8.4%) with no experience of ischemic heart disease. Information about the cause of death was not obtained in this study, as the Danish Registry of Causes of Death is only updated to year 2000, making it insufficient for the main part of the 5-year follow-up time used in this study. Hence, we cannot directly attribute the reported poorer survival chance of 192RR homozygotic women to an increased susceptibility to CHD and death. Instead, we used self-reported data on ischemic heart disease (angina and/or acute myocardial infarction) to examine whether the increased mortality seen in 192RR women may possibly be caused by an increased susceptibility to development of CHD. We found a slightly higher proportion of RR homozygotes in the disease group compared to the nondisease group (11.8% vs 8.4%) in women. However, this did not reach statistical significance. This observation is in line with the results of the recent meta-analysis conducted by Wheeler et al9 showing that PON 192Q/R was only weakly associated with CHD susceptibility.

Discussion

Although reports have been contradictory, several studies have suggested an association between PON1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. As cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in middle-aged and elderly people, an impact of such polymorphisms on mortality could be expected. In this study, we investigated the relation of three PON1 polymorphisms, 107C/T, 55M/L and 192Q/R, with survival in a large sample of Danish individuals aged 47-93 years, using both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study design. The cross-sectional study revealed no difference in genotype distribution in neither men nor women for either of the polymorphisms when comparing different age groups, nor was there any change in haplotype distribution. As our data indicate an effect on the mortality pattern of RR homozygotes in women, this implies that PON1 192RR homozygosity, rather than being a susceptibility factor for CHD, is associated with CHD severity and survival after CHD. If PON1 192RR homozygosity is associated with higher mortality immediately after myocardial infarction, the association with CHD in case-control studies will be weaker than the association with survival. In support of this hypothesis, Chen et al20 recently reported an association between the PON1 192R allele and coronary artery disease severity in white women when evaluating disease severity in terms of the number of diseased vessels.

Contrary to our findings, Heijmans et al10 found no significant effect of the Q192R and M55L polymorphisms on either cardiovascular or all-cause mortality risks in 666 subjects aged 85+. This apparent discrepancy may be caused by the fact that our study population has a much larger age range (47-93 years), as well as the larger sample size in our study, which may be necessary to detect a moderately increased mortality risk as the one reported in the present study.

We furthermore observed a significantly decreased mortality risk in 55M/L heterozygotes compared to 55MM homozygotes in women. The finding of a decreased risk for heterozygotes only is not compatible with either a recessive or a dominant effect of the 55L allele. Furthermore, this result was not replicated in the second sample. As we find some degree of pairwise allelic association among all three polymorphisms (D0.23-0.42), these deviating results for PON55 may merely reflect the partial linkage disequilibrium with PON192.

In conclusion, we found no substantial impact of PON1 polymorphisms or haplotypes on longevity when comparing elderly Danish subjects to younger individuals in neither men nor women. However, the follow-up analysis suggested that, in particular, women homozygous for PON1 192RR may have an increased mortality risk in the second half of life.
