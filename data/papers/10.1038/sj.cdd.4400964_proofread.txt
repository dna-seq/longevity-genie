Genetic polymorphisms of Fas (CD95) and FasL (CD178) in human longevity: studies on centenarians. M Pinti, L Troiano, M Nasi, L Moretti, E Monterastelli, A Mazzacani, C Mussi, P Ventura, F Olivieri, C Franceschi, G Salvioli, and A Cossarizza conducted a study on apoptosis in aging. Aging causes changes in the balance between cell proliferation/activation and cell loss, which leads to immunosenescence. The study aimed to investigate the genetic regulation of Fas and FasL in aging and longevity. CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) is a type 1 transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily that plays an essential role in apoptosis pathways. Fas regulates immune processes such as selection of T cell repertoire and deletion of self-reactive cells. It can be bound by its natural ligand called FasL (CD178), a protein member of TNF superfamily. Cross-linking of Fas by FasL leads to trimerization of death domain (DD) of Fas in the inner membrane surface; the trimeric Fas recruits an adapter protein called the Fas associated DD (FADD), forming a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Procaspase 8 is autolytically cleaved into active caspase 8, which activates caspase 3 and starts a complex signaling pathway that leads to apoptosis.

The study analyzed the polymorphisms of 50 centenarians and 86 young donors living in Northern Italy for both Fas and FasL. The first Fas polymorphism at position 7670 has a heterozygosity of 51% in Caucasians. The second polymorphism at position 71377 has a wild type allele (G) with a frequency of 83% compared to the mutant allele. The study found that genotype and allele distribution for both polymorphisms were similar in controls and centenarians. Similar results were found for two FasL polymorphisms (IVS2nt-124 and IVS3nt169). The data suggest that Fas and FasL polymorphisms, as well as their haplotypes, are unlikely to be associated with successful human longevity.

The expression of Fas increases with age in CD4+ and CD8+ cells. This increase is present in both nave (CD45RA+, CD62L+) or memory T lymphocytes (CD45R0+, CD62L7), suggesting that the shift from nave to memory is not solely responsible for this phenomenon. The upregulation of Fas, along with reduced expression of bcl-2, has been correlated to the existence of an age-related increased susceptibility to apoptosis in CD4 and CD8 T cells. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that modifies the expression of Fas in lymphocytes of elderly subjects or its transcriptional regulation, and it is not known whether and how aging influences the activity of this gene.

In conclusion, the study suggests that genetic polymorphisms of Fas and FasL are unlikely to be associated with successful human longevity.subjects

We conducted a study on the possible association between two Fas promoter polymorphisms (7670 and 71377) and longevity in a group of 86 young controls and 50 centenarians. We estimated haplotype frequencies using a sensitive method and found no significant differences between the two populations, although some combinations of genotypes were lacking due to the absence of A/A genotype at position 71377 in centenarians.

We also analyzed the frequency of FasL genotypes and haplotypes in both groups and found no significant differences between the whole groups or between female subgroups.

In conclusion, our study found no evidence of an association between these polymorphisms and longevity in centenarians, suggesting that other factors may play a role in successful aging.Genotype Group IVS2nt-124 IVS3nt169 Controls Centenarians A/A T/T 29 (38.2%) 23 (54.7%) A/A T/delT 12 (15.8%) 6 (14.3%) A/A delT/delT 6 (7.9%) 1 (2.4%) A/G T/T 26 (34.2%) 10 (23.8%) A/G T/delT 3 (3.9%) 1 (2.4%) A/G delT/delT 0 1 (2.4%)

There was an unexpected increase in parameters linked to inflammation, such as the capacity to produce proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, which is involved in the induction of apoptosis in a variety of cell types that could confer an advantage in reaching a far advanced age.

The 71377 polymorphism is situated in the binding site for SP-1 transcription factor, and the presence of A in both alleles could significantly modify the transcription of Fas, with important consequences for the equilibrium of Fas/FasL apoptotic pathway. We are tempted to speculate that the presence of the homozygous form of this mutation could be harmful, and so the occurrence of A/A genotype in 71377 position is strongly negatively selected. However, young controls who have this genotype apparently do not show any disorder that can be associated with impaired expression of Fas. This point needs further investigation and can be clarified by direct quantitation of Fas mRNA in lymphocytes or other cells obtained from these subjects, as well as by in vitro analysis of Fas promoter activity with A or G in position 71377. Electro-mobility shift assays could further elucidate the eventual modifications occurring in SP-1 binding when A allele is present in both copies of the Fas gene. Finally, it will be crucial to investigate these polymorphisms in subjects of other age-groups.

Expression of Fas on lymphocytes from elderly donors could be due to age-related changes in the susceptibility of these cells to undergo apoptosis. However, few and controversial data are present in literature. Some investigators have reported a decrease of Fas/FasL-induced apoptosis in aged animals, as well as in human CD8+ T cells reaching replicative senescence. Accordingly, we have recently reported that an inverse correlation exists between human age and the propensity of lymphocytes to undergo apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. On the other hand, other authors reported increased apoptosis in lymphocytes from elderly people following activation with anti-CD3, phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A or activation with polyclonal mitogens plus anti-Fas treatment.

Genetic polymorphisms of apoptotic genes such as Fas and FasL may play a role in regulating the expression of a given gene. Thus, we explored whether genetic polymorphisms of apoptotic genes such as Fas and FasL exist that could help in explaining the aforementioned phenomena, taking into account that no data exist on their distribution and role in human aging and longevity. In this study, we analyzed the presence of new genetic markers, i.e. 7670 and 71377 polymorphisms in Fas promoter, and IVS2nt-124 and IVS3nt169 in FasL gene, in a group of 50 Italian centenarians and 86 young donors. No significant differences were found in the genotype and allele frequency between centenarians and controls for all polymorphisms. These data suggest that these polymorphisms likely do not confer any genetic advantage to reach the extreme limit of human life. Moreover, considering the entire group of individuals we have analyzed, our data on Fas gene are in agreement with data reported by Huang et al. for normal Caucasian population. Indeed, the frequencies of the alleles we have analyzed are very similar to those previously reported.

We found no major differences between centenarians and young donors except for the frequencies of the Fas (71377A/7670Added to the reaction mixture were a final concentration of 200 nM for each primer, 200 mM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris Cl (pH 8.5), and 1 U of Taq polymerase. The reaction was conducted in a PE 9700 Thermal Cycler for 30 cycles, with each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, and 30 s at 72°C. The first cycle was preceded by a single step of denaturation at 94°C for 6 min, and the last one was followed by a single step of extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Biochemicals), and then, 20 ng of purified DNA was used for sequencing reactions with the BigDye DNA Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer). The sequencing reaction was carried out in a PE 9700 Thermal Cycler under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Sequenced samples were loaded into a PE ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin Elmer) and analyzed using ABI Prism Navigator Software. The two alleles, depending on the presence of A or G at position 71377, were observed as different fluorescence peaks in that position.

For the primers (F3 and F4) with two mismatches at position three were used in combination with a common reverse primer (F5). F3 primer is specific for allele G at position 71377, and F4 is specific for allele A. For each sample testing two PCR reactions in different tubes were performed; one reaction detected the wild-type (G) allele while the other detected the mutant (A) allele using a specific forward primer and the common reverse primer. PCR products, 393 bp fragments, from both reactions were then run on two different gels because of the exact same size of the two products. If DNA samples were homozygous for the wild-type allele, there would be only products in the reaction containing the wild-type specific primer. Conversely, if a sample was homozygous for the mutant allele, a product was only generated in the reaction containing the primer specific for the mutant allele. The presence of PCR products in both reactions indicated that the sample was heterozygous. For each reaction in 25 ml, 100 ng of DNA template was added to the reaction mixture, containing a final concentration of 200 nM of each primer, 200 mM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris Cl (pH 8.5), and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Promega). The reaction was carried out in a PE 9700 Thermal Cycler for 30 cycles, with each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 62°C, and 1 min at 72°C. The first cycle was preceded by a single step of denaturation at 94°C for 6 min, and the last one was followed by a single step of extension at 72°C for 10 min.

A group of 50 centenarians and 86 controls living in Northern Italy (Emilia-Romagna Region, located in the Po Valley area) were studied. The mean age of centenarians (44 females and six males) was 100.8±1.8 years (mean±S.D., range: 100-106), whereas the mean age of young donors (36 females and 50 males), randomly chosen among students, medical personnel, and blood donors, was 38.1±8.5 years (range: 22-54). Blood was taken from all donors after informed consent according to the Italian laws, and DNA was extracted using a commercially available kit (QIA Amp DNA blood minikit, from Qiagen).

The MvaI RFLP was studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by MvaI restriction enzyme digestion, as previously described. The primer sequences used for PCR were MvaIDir (5-CTACCTAAGAGCTATCTACCGTTC-3) and MvaIRev (5-GGCTGTCCATGTTGTGGCTGC-3). For each reaction in 25 ml, 100 ng of DNA template was added to the reaction mixture, containing a final concentration of 200 nM of each primer, 200 mM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris Cl (pH 8.5), and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
