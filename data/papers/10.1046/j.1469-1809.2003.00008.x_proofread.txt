The study investigated the variability of genes coding for apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), and apolipoprotein A4 (APOA4) in a healthy ageing population ranging from 18 to 109 years. The study aimed to describe possible modifications of the APOA1, APOC3, and APOA4 genes in healthy ageing people. The sample group consisted of 327 males and 473 females who were free of clinically manifested disease and had emato-chemical parameters within the norm. The APOA1-MspI-RFLP (75 nt from the transcription starting site), APOC3-SstI-RFLP (3 UTR, nt), and APOA4-HincII-RFLP (Asp/Ser) were analyzed according to age and sex. The study found a significant age variation of the APOA1 gene pool in males. An analysis of the allele average effect exerted by A/P alleles (Absence/Presence of the restriction site) on lipidemic parameters in 46-80-year-olds showed that allele A decreased while allele P significantly increased serum LDL-cholesterol. Unexpectedly, the P allele was over-represented in the group of oldest old subjects, thus giving evidence of another genetic paradox. Although epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown the significance of these genes in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular diseases, the importance of the variability of other APO genes, particularly APOA1, APOC3, and APOA4, on healthy ageing and mortality has yet to be assessed.Years (median age 29 years), 267 subjects aged DNA analyses. DNA was extracted from blood buffy coats following standard procedures. APOA1-MspI-RFLP (75 nt from S. Garasto et al., the transcription starting site), APOC3-SstI-RFLP 31 (3' UTR, 3238 nt), and APOA4-HincII-RFLP (Asp/127 Ser) were analyzed by restriction analysis after PCR amplification of the DNA regions containing the restriction sites. Regions, primers, and PCR experimental conditions are available on request from the email address of the corresponding author (g.debenedictis@unical.it). The effects of the locus on the lipidemic parameters were estimated according to Christiansen & Feldman (1986). The 95% confidence intervals of and were calculated by bootstrap (10,000 replications, MATLAB Statistics toolbox).

Results
Genotypic and allelic data of APOA1-MspI-RFLP, APOC3-SstI-RFLP, and APOA4-HincII-RFLP were analyzed in three age classes (18-45 years; 46-80 years; 81-109 years) for each sex. All the sample groups were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05).

Statistical analyses
For single markers, allele frequencies were obtained by counting genes from the observed genotypes. Chi-squared tests were applied to verify Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in each sample. Homogeneity of genotypic and allelic frequency distributions among the groups of different age (18-45 years; 46-80 years; 109 years) in each sex was tested by a chi-squared test.

In males (Table 1a), there was a significant difference among the age-related genotypic counts (χ2 = 9.63 with 4 df., p = 0.045 with Yates correction). Accordingly, allele counts were different among the three age-groups (χ2 = 8.29 with 2 df., p = 0.016). On inspecting the data, the P allele frequency showed a minimum (and the A allele frequency a maximum) in the intermediate age-class. To investigate this finding and outline the age-related frequency trajectory of the P (or A) allele, the group of 327 males was subdivided into five age-classes (18-25 years; 26-45 years; 46-65 years; 66-80 years; 81-109 years), and P allele frequency was estimated in each class. A concave frequency trajectory was observed, the significance of which was tested as described in the methods. The estimated value of the leading coefficient b = 0.217 was significantly larger than zero, because the central 95% empirical confidence interval of was 0.112-0.495. Out of the 10,000 trajectories simulated by bootstrap, 9,987 were concave, only one was convex, ten were monotone increasing, and two were monotone decreasing. By assuming that a trend in the data is significant if more than 95% of the simulated trajectories show that trend, the concave pattern of the P allele frequency fully satisfied this requirement. Denoting age as x and letting f(x) be the age-related frequency trajectory of the allele P, the age-related frequency trajectory of the A allele (absence of the restriction site) was given by f(x) = A - f(x), because only two alleles are present in the population. Fig.1 shows the relative frequency of the P allele in the five age-groups, the fitting curve, and the lower and upper envelopes of the 10,000 simulated trajectories.

The age-related frequency trajectory of the APOA1 allele P (Presence of the MspI restriction site) was analyzed by least squares method. The MATLAB function polyfit was used to fit a 2nd degree polynomial y = b0 + b1x/x + b2x2/x2 to the frequencies of allele P observed in five classes of age (18-25 years; 26-45 years; 46-65 years; 66-80 years; 81-109 years), thus obtaining estimates b0, b1, b2. The mean of the ages of individuals belonging to each age-class was taken as the x value for that class. Ten thousand replicates of b0, b1, b2 were then generated by the bootstrap method (MATLAB Statistics toolbox), from which the empirical distribution of b0, b1 was obtained and confidence limits were calculated for the age-related frequency trajectory.

PROCESSED TEXT:
P 327 (88.9 1.6) 207 (92.4 1.8) 328 (92.7 1.4) Exact tests applied to this data did not reveal age-related heterogeneity either in males or females (A1-C3 haplotypes: p = 0.296 in males, p = 0.126 in females; C3-A4 haplotypes: p = 0.157 in males, p = 0.095 in females). The association between age and APOA1 variability was absent in females (Table 1b), where either genotypes (2=7.56 with 4 df., p=0.109) or alleles (2=3.22 with 2 df., p=0.200) did not discriminate among age-classes. As for APOC3 and APOA4 variability (Tables 2 and 3 respectively), no age-related variation in the gene pool was observed either in males or females, as shown by heterogeneity tests among age-classes (p>0.05 in all cases). 

APOA1 variability was significantly associated with the age of the cohort, and in a sex-specific way. In order to shed light on these findings, the average effects exerted by the A and P alleles of APOA1 on lipidemic parameters were estimated in the sample of 4680-year-old males, where the A and P alleles reached maximum and minimum age-related frequency values respectively (see Table 1a). Due to the low value of the standard deviation (SD) of the BMI (25.62 average value with 2.87 SD), data were not corrected for this parameter. The average effects are shown in Table 6a: the alleles A/P significantly decreased/increased serum average LDL-C but had non-significant effects on TC, HDL-C, TG. Interestingly, when the same analysis was carried out in the corresponding group of females (26.08 average BMI with 3.49 SD), where no association was present between age and APOA1 variability, no significant effect was found on any of the lipidemic parameters (Table 6b). 

In order to verify if haplotypes were more informative than single markers, linkage disequilibrium (D) between pairs of markers was analyzed in the whole sample of 800 subjects. The disequilibrium was significant between APOA1 and APOC3 markers (2 with 1 df.=11.46; p=0.0007; Drel.=60.0%), as well as between APOC3 and APOA4 markers (2 with 1 df.=339.14; p=0.0000; Drel.=82.7%), while it was non-significant between APOA1 and APOA4 markers (2 with 1 df.=1.98; p=0.159; Drel.=7.5%). The frequencies of the haplotypes defined by APOA1-APOC3 and APOC3-APOA4 markers in males and females of different age-classes are shown in Tables 4 and 5.

Table 5 shows haplotypes of APOC3-SstI-RFLP (5) and APOA4-ae3/) HincII-RFLP (3) in samples of individuals of different ages. A/P indicates Absence/Presence of the restriction site. Haplotypic frequencies (100) are estimated by Maximum Likelihood method. Standard errors are in parentheses.

Table 6 shows allele average effects and estimated for APOA1 A and P alleles respectively in 4580-year-old subjects. Average effects A/P are expressed in mg/dConfirming that genetic risk factors can be present and over-represented in the centenarians gene pool, several studies have shown that a genotype can be risky in middle-age but protective at very advanced age. It has also been suggested that cholesterol metabolism may differ between younger and older populations, as high serum total cholesterol concentration has been associated with increased survival in very old people. Furthermore, aging could be viewed as a side-effect of adaptive events controlled by genes causing damage, and allele P may be beneficial at very old age by repressing some causes of age-related damage.

The present study reveals two main conclusions. Firstly, the APOA1 allele P tends to increase its frequency as the cohort selected for best survival emerges from the population. Secondly, gene-sex interaction seems to be an important phenomenon in the genetic modulation of human lifespan. This analysis of the APOA1-APOC3-APOA4 gene cluster's variability reveals another paradox of centenarians and confirms the complexity of the human longevity phenotype.
