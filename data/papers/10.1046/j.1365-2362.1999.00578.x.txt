Abstract

Background Elevated fasting levels of total homocysteine are now accepted as an indepen- dent risk factor for the development of arteriosclerotic vascular diseases. A polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), caused by the C677T point mutation, leads to increased thermolability of the enzyme, with reduced enzyme activity. We studied the frequency of this mutation in different groups of the Swiss adult population.

Patients and methods DNA from 361 subjects was screened for the thermolabile MTHFR variant with PCR. Included were healthy subjects without vascular disease (n¼ 118), older healthy subjects (n¼ 106), patients with coronary artery disease (CAD, n¼ 75), and patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD, n¼ 63).

Results In the different groups studied, homozygosity for the mutation ranged from 4·8 to 16·2%, with a frequency of 16·2% in the healthy cohort. The allele frequencies of the thermolabile allele were 38·5 and 27·3 in young and old controls, and 37·3 and 33·3 in CAD and PAOD patients. In the healthy younger subjects the mutant allele was 1·4 times more frequent compared to the older subjects (P¼ 0·01). No difference in either MTHFR genotype distribution (P¼ 0·33) or allele frequencies (P ¼ 0·48) between patients and controls was found. Except for the PAOD group with elevated tHcy levels for the þ/þ carriers compared to the other genotypes, no statistically significant difference was found comparing homocysteine levels with genotype.

Conclusion This study shows no link between the mutation and the occurrence of vascular disease but we found evidence pointing to a correlation between the mutation and longevity in our population.

Introduction

as an independent risk factor for vascular disease in a large number of retrospective and some prospective studies [1,2].

Moderate increases of total homocysteine (tHcy) either fasting or post methionine loading have been established

The underlying cause for increased homocysteine (Hcy) levels in vascular disease patients and the exact mechanism by which Hcy induces vascular damage remain to be elucidated. Both genetic and nutritional factors such as folate [3], vitamin B12 [4] and B6 [5] certainly play a role; sometimes acting in combination.

Kang and coworkers [6] first showed a link between moderately disturbed function of MTHFR in lymphocytes, measured as an increased thermolability, and moderate increases of tHcy in plasma of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Following the cloning and sequencing of the gene for MTHFR [7], a C!T transition at 677, which results in an alanine to valine conversion at amino acid 222, was established as the cause of thermolability and mildly reduced specific activity of MTHFR [8].

patients with CAD with occlusions of 1–3 major coronary arteries undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and 63 peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) patients. Six of these PAOD patients had inter- mittent claudication (Fontaine, stage II), and 59 suffered from critical limb ischemia (stage III/IV). Twenty-six patients had a history of one or more vascular events other than PAOD (in total 24 coronary artery and 5 cerebrovascular events). Subjects with a family history of premature vascular disease were excluded. After a fasting period of at least 4 h, blood samples were collected for the determination of tHcy, methyltetrahydrofolate (MeTHF), and MTHFR genotype.

presence of homozygosity for C677T was shown to result in slightly higher tHcy and this effect was amplified in subjects with total plasma folate levels below the median value [9].

The question of whether homozygosity for C677T itself is a risk factor for vascular disease has been addressed in many studies by comparing genotype frequencies in control and patient populations. These studies have revealed strikingly wide differences of frequencies of homozygosity for C677T ranging from 4% in a control population from Brazil [10] to 23% in an Italian control group [11]. So far a number of studies have indeed shown an increased fre- quency of the homozygosity rate in vascular disease patient groups [10,12–16] and Kluijtmans et al. [15] have calcu- lated an odds ratio of 1·2 for risk of vascular disease in the presence of homozygosity for C677T, based on eight case- control studies. In contrast the majority of studies includ- ing cerebrovascular disease [17,18], deep-vein thrombosis [11,19,20], peripheral arterial disease [21] and cardiovas- cular disease [20–34] show no higher frequency in vascular disease, pointing to an opposite conclusion at least in some populations. If the genotype, homozygosity for the muta- tion as frequent cause of hyperhomocysteinemia, is indeed a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease, associated with premature death, its frequency is expected to decrease with increasing age in a population of healthy controls. Brattstro¨m found no evidence for the C677T mutation predisposing for disease or premature death in a meta- analysis including 1388 elderly and 1415 younger subjects [35]. On the other hand Faure-Delanef described a trend towards a lower frequency of the mutation in elderly [36] whereas Matsushita found a significant difference in fre- quency between younger and older healthy groups [37]. The emerging picture is one of a high frequency of the polymorphism in all populations, a clear association between the occurrence of the mutation and tHcy levels [38,39] which is exacerbated when folate tends towards lower levels, but so far no conclusive evidence that the mutation itself is a risk factor for vascular disease.

Methods

Venous blood samples for DNA isolation were collected and stored as whole blood at ¹708C or lymphocytes were isolated immediately and stored as dry pellets at ¹708C. Genomic DNA was isolated from 200mL EDTA blood or  lymphocytes with the QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) as described by the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA extracts from 362 subjects were screened for the thermolabile MTHFR variant using the restriction frag- ment length polymorphism–polymerase chain reaction (RFLP–PCR). PCR amplification using the primer pair as proposed by Frosst [8] generates a 198-bp fragment. As the C677T mutation creates a recognition site for the restriction enzyme HinfI, digestion of the amplified frag- ment with the restriction enzyme HinfI (Promega, Catalys AG, Wallisellen, Switzerland) results in a 175-bp and 23-bp fragment if the mutation is present. Digestion was performed for 16h and the restriction digests were sepa- rated on a 3% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide for visualisation (Fig. 1). In each run a H O control was 2 included to check for unspecific reactions. To check the PCR reaction, the resulting PCR product was sequenced on one occasion to confirm a correct match with the published sequence.

In this study we established the frequency of the C677T mutation in healthy Swiss subjects and patients with vascular disease and evaluated the relationship between the muta- tion and plasma Hcy. Furthermore, we compared the frequency of the mutation as a function of age between the different study groups.

Fasting tHcy and MeTHF concentrations were assayed in EDTA plasma. Sample collection conditions and deter- mination of the parameters by HPLC with fluorescence detection were performed as described previously [40].

Statistics

Subjects and methods

Compliance of genotype distributions to the Hardy–Wein- berg equilibrium was evaluated by x2 analysis. To look for differences between the various groups, unpaired t-test for measured variables and x2-test for contingency tables were used. P <0·05 were considered to be statistically signifi- cant. multifactorial analysis was used to test for ANOVA differences in tHcy levels between the different genotypes, with age, gender and estimated creatinine clearance [41] as covariates. Values are expressed as the mean 6SD. Statis- tical analysis was performed with the software packages Statview and Student 1·0. SYSTAT

Patients and control subjects

Volunteers were recruited at the University Hospital Basel. All subjects gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the institution. This Swiss population included 224 healthy subjects and 138 hospitalised patients with a history of vascular disease. The healthy subjects were divided into young (#65 years) and elderly (>65 years) subjects. The patients included 75

Results

tendency towards significance was confirmed when con- sidering the number of carriers against noncarriers of the C677T mutation between these control groups (P ¼ 0·03).

The prevalence of the three C677T genotypes and overall allele frequencies in young and elderly controls as well as the two patient groups are shown in Table 1.

The C677T substitution was found to be common in all groups with an overall allele frequency of 27·3–38·5%. The frequencies of this mutant allele in the patients and in the combined control group were similar (P >0·3). A signifi- cant difference was found when comparing allele frequen- cies both between the elderly control group and the young control group (P¼ 0·01; mutant allele 1·4 times more pre- valent), or the CAD group (P ¼ 0·04; mutant allele again 1·4 more prevalent). No difference of allele frequencies was found between the elderly group and the PAOD group. The MTHFR genotypes followed the Hardy–Weinberg equili- brium in all groups except for the PAOD group.

The frequency of the homozygous mutant genotype in the healthy Swiss population was 16%. No statistically significant difference in genotype distribution was found when comparing gender, when comparing the four differ- ent groups, or when cases (PAOD and CAD) and controls (young and elderly) were compared with each other. As folate values were not available in all groups, subjects were divided into those with tHcy levels above or below the median values. A tHcy level above the median might serve as a marker for low folate status and allow testing of the genotype–cardiovascular link. No differences of the genotype distributions between high and low tHcy groups were found, confirming the lack of such a link in our study. A P-value of 0·056 was calculated for the genotype distri- bution between the young and elderly control group. This

Age, tHcy and MeTHF concentrations of the different groups partially reported elsewhere [40] are summarised in Table 2. tHcy levels were significantly different between all groups (0·001 < P <0·02), and showed a clear increase with age. Although the mean age of the elderly healthy group

Discussion

In this study the prevalence of the MTHFR C677T muta- tion, a possible risk factor for vascular disease, was inves- tigated in the Swiss population, focusing on elderly and vascular disease patients. The prevalence of the homozy- gous genotype (16%) found in our control population was towards the higher level found in other populations of Caucasian origin, including Dutch (5%) [14,42], Irish (6%) [43], Canadian (17%) [9] and Americans (12%) [8], although a much higher prevalence (30%) was found by Abbate in Italy’s Tuscany region [44].

An important finding in our study is the lower presence of the C677T allele in the elderly control group compared with the younger controls. Although some unrecognised differences between the sample cohorts cannot be com- pletely excluded, these results confirm the findings of Faure-Delanef [36] who described a trend towards a lower frequency of homozygotes for the C677T mutation in elderly people. Matsushita [37] found a significant

the observation [1,12,47–50] that Hcy values were signifi- cantly higher in both patient groups and elderly controls compared with the younger control group.

difference in frequency between younger and older groups. The meta-analysis by Brattstro¨m revealed no significant difference in genotype between young and elderly [35], but here again the C677T homozygotes were under repre- sented in the older group.

A statistically significant difference of tHcy values was found between the different genotypes in the PAOD patients but not in the other groups. This absence of a correlation between MTHFR genotype and tHcy levels in three of the groups, could be attributed to a sufficient folate intake that largely compensates for the enzyme disturbance [9,27,29,31,33,45,51]. This lack of correlation between genotype and tHcy levels raises the question of whether the apparently contradictory findings in the relationship between thermolabile MTHFR genotype and vascular disease can be attributed to differences in folate status only, and are due to a lack of a measurable influence of the thermolabile MTHFR genotype and Hcy in health and disease.

When the allele frequencies were considered, there was a significantly lower presence of the C677T allele in the elderly control group compared with younger controls and with CAD. This difference was less marked when the elderly controls were compared with the PAOD group. In this context the mean ages of the old control group (76 years 6 16) and the PAOD group (74 years 610) are very similar, and different from the other groups. This age- associated decrease in the prevalence of the mutation may indicate a shift in favour of the wild type allele through aging, indicating a lower life expectancy for individuals homozygous for the mutation. Whether this lower life expectancy is caused by vascular disease remains open, as we found no direct association between the thermolabile MTHFR genotype and disease. In this regard it is note- worthy that the PAOD group patients were of similar age to the elderly control group and also revealed a reduced frequency of the þ/þ genotype. The difference in allele frequency compared to the young controls seems therefore to be influenced by age rather than by disease status.

Several investigators showed an increased frequency of the C677T mutation in patients in a wide range of vascular diseases [10,12,14,16,46]. In our study, comparison of healthy and patient populations revealed no statistically significant difference in the C677T genotype distribution. This lack of association between the thermolabile MTHFR genotype and the disease confirms the results reported in many other studies [20,22–25,29,33,34,45].

These findings are in apparent contrast to earlier studies but these were not specially designed to evaluate the influence of age [12,22,45]. Most studies have focused on the comparison of age-matched controls and patients [25] or compared mutation frequencies in groups with no or with only a small age difference [12,23,27,45]. These studies including the meta-analysis of Brattstro¨m con- cluded that no differences exist when considering age [12,22–24,45]. In our study the average difference between younger and elderly controls of 37 years is much greater than in most studies. This age difference is similar to that reported by Faure-Delanef [36], and Matsushita [37] who also reported a trend toward a lower frequency of the MTHFR C677T þ/þ genotype in old age groups. A secular shift could possibly explain the difference seen between young and old controls.

In conclusion, tHcy concentrations are not consistently related to the mutant allele; at least in subjects with adequate folate intake. Therefore the possibility that the reduced frequency of the C677Tallele with increasing age is not directly related to Hcy induced vascular morbidity or mortality needs to be evaluated. Finally this study rein- forces the lack of a link between the presence of homo- zygosity for the mutation and the occurrence of vascular disease shown in the majority of previous studies.

Furthermore Anderson et al. [23] observed no increased risk for myocardial infarction in subjects above 60 years of age with the þ/þ genotype in contrast to subjects below 60 in whom increased risk was found. This could indicate a lower frequency of the þ/þ genotype in elderly subjects also in this study. Although none of these findings showed high statistical significance, age-dependency may have contrib- uted also to the results of Deloughery et al. and van Bockxmeer et al. [21,45] where a lower incidence of the þ/þ genotype was observed in the older patient group compared to younger controls. Thus the data available so far comparing older and younger groups allow no definite conclusion to be made and further studies focusing on the question of whether the homozygous status for C677T has an impact on life expectancy, in particular prospective studies, are needed.
