Context: Exceptional longevity is associated with raised serum TSH.

Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether offspring of people with exceptional longevity have elevated serum TSH and whether specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TSH-B gene and TSH receptor (TSHR) gene are associated with this phenotype.

Design/Setting/Patients: We measured serum TSH and free T in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians 4 (n(cid:1)232;medianage,97yr),theiroffspring(n(cid:1)366;medianage,69yr),andage-matchedcontrols without familial longevity (n   163; median age, 70 yr). We determined TSH heritability, its dis- tribution, and association with SNPs in the TSH-B and TSHR genes.

Results: Offspring had higher median serum TSH [1.68 mIU/liter (97.5% confidence interval, 0.65 to 4.79 mIU/liter)], compared to controls [1.50 mIU/liter (97.5% confidence interval, 0.63 to 3.93 mIU/liter); P   0.02], with estimated heritability of 0.33 (P   0.004). Allele frequency of two SNPs in the promoter/enhancer region of TSHR gene, associated with increased serum TSH, was higher in centenarians and their offspring compared to controls (rs10149689 G allele frequency, 0.57 and 0.53 vs. 0.48; P   0.001 and P   0.08; odds ratio, 1.56 and 1.22, respectively; and rs12050077 A allele frequency, 0.57 and 0.53 vs. 0.46; P   0.0001 and P   0.01; odds ratio, 1.68 and 1.32, respectively).

Furthermore, GA haplotype frequency was significantly higher among centenarians and offspring compared to controls (0.57 and 0.53 vs. 0.46; P   0.0001 and P   0.01, respectively).

Conclusions: A heritable phenotype characterized by raised serum TSH is associated with human longevity. Carriers of rs12050077 and rs10149689 SNPs in the TSHR have higher serum TSH, possibly contributing to decreased thyroid function and longevity. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94: 4768–4775, 2009)

Several studies in humans suggest decreases in thyroid function with aging, which are considered to be in- dependent of antithyroid antibody levels or age-related comorbidities (1–3). Wehavepreviouslydemonstratedthat the increased TSH with aging reflects a progressive popula- tion shift to higher serum TSH with age that extends even to people who have achieved exceptional longevity (4–6). Because increased serum TSH concentrations may reflect decreased thyroid function, we hypothesized that excep- tional longevity may be associated with decreased thyroid

hormone secretion (6). Furthermore, we have recently reported a significant inverse correlation between se- rum TSH and free T (FT4) in Ashkenazi Jewish cente- 4 narians and younger Ashkenazi Jewish controls (6), suggesting a functional feedback in thyroid hormone regulation that results in a relative (subclinical) decrease in thyroid function.

These findings in humans are further supported by an- imal studies that demonstrate an inverse correlation be- tween extended life span and decreased thyroid function

(7, 8), suggesting a causal relationship. The precise mech- anisms responsible for the effects of hypothyroidism on life span, however, have not been clarified, although mul- tiple actions of decreased thyroid hormone concentrations (including lowering the metabolic rate, lowering core body temperature and oxygen consumption, and reducing reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative damage) may play an important role in longevity (9–14).

We chose to study Ashkenazi Jews due to their known genetic homogeneity that is attributed to founder effects. The founders lived in the 16th to 17th centuries in eastern and central Europe. Although this population experienced isolation, inbreeding, and genetic drift, it has undergone rapid growth after immigration to the United States, beginning in the 18th century. In the past, the Ashkenazi population has served as a valuable genetic resource to discover the genetic bases of several Mendelian disorders as well as age-related diseases (21).

Hereditary and genetic influences on serum thyroid hor- mone and TSH concentrations have been reported in twin studies (15, 16) and in Mexican-American families (17). In addition, several recent reports show that polymorphisms in severalthyroidpathwaygenescouldinfluenceserumthyroid hormone and TSH concentrations (18–20).

Founder populations amplify certain gene variants while maintaining great stretches of uniformity in other DNA se- quences. Genes that are very close together exhibit extremely tight linkage (linkage disequilibrium), which is particularly pro- nounced in isolated populations. Numerous association studies have exploited the properties of linkage disequilibrium, geneti- cally uniform background in the isolated and founder popula- tions, such as the Finnish and Icelandic populations (22–24).

In this study, we hypothesized that the alterations in thyroid function seen in human longevity may have a ge- netic basis. Consequently, we examined thyroid function in offspring of individuals with exceptional longevity and searched for genetic markers that may be responsible for the specific pattern of thyroid function tests observed in this population.

TSH and FT4 analyses

Measurements of TSH were performed at the laboratories of Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, using a solid- phase, two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Immu- nolite 2000 Third Generation TSH; Siemens Corp., Tarrytown, NY; manufacturer’s reference limits, 0.4–4.0 mIU/liter). FT4 was measured using ELISA (Alpco Diagnostic, Salem, NH; man- ufacturer’s reference limits, 0.8–1.8 ng/dl). Because this method provides only an estimate of FT4 and not a direct measurement of FT4, all FT4 values represent estimated levels of FT4. Anti- thyroid antibodies were not determined because of insufficient availability of serum.

This project was part of the Longevity program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.

Subjects and Methods

Population

We studied three distinct populations: 1) 232 Ashkenazi Jew- ish centenarians (166 women, median age, 97 yr; and 66 men, median age, 97 yr); 2) 366 Ashkenazi Jewish offspring of these centenarians (185 women, median age, 68 yr; and 181 men, median age, 69 yr); and 3) 111 of the offsprings’ Ashkenazi Jewish spouses (control group A; 51 women, median age, 66 yr; and 60 men, median age, 73 yr). An additional control group of 52 Ashkenazi Jews (control group B; 28 women, median age, 70 yr;and24men,medianage,75yr),whichwasnotfamily-related totheabovesubjectsbutwasfromthesamegeographicarea,was similarly assessed. Two control groups were used to exclude any possibility of environmental factors affecting the thyroid func- tiontestsincontrolgroupA(subjectslivedinthesamehousehold as their spouse, the offspring). However, all parameters tested were virtually identical in both control groups (data not shown). Thus, in our report, the controls represent control group A and control group B combined. All participants were recruited randomly.

Due to logistic and technical restrictions, serum FT4 was an- alyzed in 174 offspring and 172 controls. However, only 100 offspring and 134 controls had both serum TSH and FT4 deter- mined (inter- and intraassay coefficients of variation were 1.5 and 3% for TSH, and 3 and 6% for FT4).

Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

TheTSHgene,alsocalledTSH-B (TSH subunit- ), spans 4.5 kb with three exons and is located on the long arm of chro- mosome 1. We selected four SNPs (rs10494170, rs12046203, rs12740035, and rs7523360) of TSH-B gene and genotyped them in both Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and controls. The allelicfrequenciesoftheseSNPsbetweentheAshkenaziJewishcen- tenarians and controls did not show significant differences. Due to the association between TSH receptor (TSHR) and TSH expres- sion, we further examined SNPs in this gene. SNPs (rs12050077 and rs10149689) were genotyped using the PSQ HS 96A Pyrose- quencer, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Py- rosequencing, Uppsala, Sweden; www.pyrosequencing.com). Briefly, a PCR product was generated from a primer pair that included one primer covalently coupled to biotin, the biotinyl- ated template was bound to streptavidin-coated Sepharose HP beads, and this mixture was then annealed to a sequencing primer.

Stated age was verified by checking birth certificates or U.S. passports. Jewish religion was self-reported (mother and father Jewish), and subjects were considered Ashkenazi Jews if their four grandparents were originally Ashkenazi Jews.

Serum TSH distribution

Statistical analysis

Serum TSH concentrations in the offspring were sig- nificantly higher compared with controls [median, 97.5% CI: 1.68 (0.65–4.79) and 1.55 (0.63–3.93) mIU/liter, re- spectively; P  0.02; Table 1). Moreover, serum TSH distribution was also shifted to higher TSH concentra- tions in offspring compared with controls, including the TSH concentrations at peak frequency (Fig. 1), suggest- ing a population shift phenomenon. TSH distribution in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, recently published (4) and shown only for comparative purposes, was further shifted to higher TSH concentrations (Fig. 1) compared with offspring, suggesting a genetic predisposition for higher TSH.

All analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis Soft- ware(SASInstitute,CaryNC),version9.12.BecauseserumTSH and FT4 were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests in- cluding the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA by ranks and Mann-Whitney rank sum test were used for group comparisons.

(cid:2)2 test was performed to compare the difference in TSHR genotype frequencies. Genotype frequencies of all SNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Because two SNPs (in the TSHR) were involved in an independent new assay, the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used; thus << the threshold for statistical significance was P 0.025. Given that this is a relatively homogeneous population, tests for pop- ulation stratification were not performed. The haplotype asso- ciation test between cases (Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians) and controls was performed using Haploview 4 software (http:// www.broad.institut.org/haploview/haploview). Wilcoxon sta- tistics were calculated to test homogeneity between the groups.

To determine whether medications taken by partici- pants may affect TSH concentration, we applied a linear regression model where serum TSH levels served as a de- pendent variable, and various medications taken by our study subjects served as independent variables; no signif- icant effect of any medication was detected. Furthermore, stepwise regression of a mixed model, where probability to enter was 0.25 and probability to leave was 0.05, dem- onstrated that none of the medications had any significant effect on serum TSH. Drug categories and percentage of subjects using the drugs are listed in Table 2, as well as the percentage of subjects taking one or more drugs.

Heritability analysis

The phenotypic variance represents a combination of genetic (additive) variance, environmental variance, and the covariance between these two factors. However, we were only interested in the additive effect (narrow sense), which was measured as the covariance(i.e.theslope)oftherelationshipbetweentheaverage performance of the offspring over the average performance of their parents multiplied by 2 because there was only one parent involved.

The differences in age distributions between males vs. females had no effect on the outcome regarding TSH lev- els, even when plotted logarithmically. In fact, when lo- gistic regression was applied, adjusting for age, the P value was 0.91, indicating total similarity (Fig. 2).

Genetic analyses

Serum FT4 distribution

Because both Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians (6) and their offspring had significantly higher serum TSH concentrations compared with controls, we determined whether TSH concentrations in these groups might be inherited. Heritability analysis demonstrated a moder-

Serum FT4 concentrations were similar in offspring and controls with a median of 1.03 ng/dl (97.5% CI, 0.67–2.00) in the offspring and 1.00 ng/dl (97.5% CI, ~ eee 0.69–1.7) in the control group (P not significant; Table 2).

There was no gender-specific difference between serum FT4 concentrations in males in all groups. Female off- spring had higher serum FT4 levels than female controls [1.04 ng/dl (97.5% CI, 0.66–1.9) vs. 0.99 ng/dl (97.5%   CI, 0.74–1.5); P 0.02].

To examine further the role of genetic factors, performed a case-control genetic analysis of TSH and TSHR variants (4 and 2, respectively). SNPs were a part of a larger group of SNPs in independent dataset comprised of individuals from same genetic origin. Although the SNPs in the TSH-B this dataset did not show significant changes cases and controls, the SNPs in the TSHR did significant differences. Thus, we chose to examine ther those SNPs using a different technology and an independent dataset. The allelic frequency for SNPs in the TSHR gene was significantly different paring Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and [rs10149689 G allele frequency, 0.57 vs. 0.48; P   odds ratio (OR), 1.56] and (rs12050077 A allele   quency, 0.57 vs. 0.46; P 0.0001; OR 1.68). allelic frequency also differed between the offspring controls (rs10149689 G allele frequency, 0.53 vs.   P 0.08; OR 1.22; and rs12050077 A allele  0.53 vs. 0.46; P 0.01; OR 1.32; Fig. 5).

Carriers of the favorable allele in the combined groups (offspring and control) have higher TSH levels [median (97.5% CI), 1.70 (0.59 to 5.34) vs.1.45 (0.50–3.99) mIU/ liter; P   0.005], suggesting that the high prevalence of the TSHR SNPs is associated with higher serum TSH levels. However, when the centenarians’ data were entered into the equation, the differences within the genotype (carriers/ noncarriers of the favorable allele) are less significant [me- dian (97.5% CI), 1.89 (0.61–5.07) vs. 1.60 (0.49–4.50) mIU/liter; P   0.04], suggesting that additional factors are involved. Finally, adjusting for age at recruitment dimin- ished the differences, suggesting that age is a crucial com- ponent of elevated TSH.

Discussion

Our data show that offspring of the centenarian group have raised serum TSH concentrations compared with

extension, suggesting that genetic determinants of creased thyroid function may modulate life span.

tenarian group who had elevated serum TSH levels also had higher TSH concentrations, suggesting a heritable trait that we documented by heritability analysis. After searching for genetic markers that could be associated with, and possibly responsible for, the raised serum TSH in centenarians and their offspring, we demonstrated for the first time that two SNPs (rs10149689 and rs12050077 of the TSHR), located between enhancer regions and close to the promoter region, were significantly associated with raised TSH concentrations in the Ashkenazi Jewish cen- tenarians and their offspring compared with controls, and showed strong linkage disequilibrium. Our new results raise the possibility that these genetic changes exert an effect on TSHR gene expression that leads to increased TSH and may be, at least in part, transmitted from indi- viduals with exceptional longevity to their offspring.

Thyroid hormone has profound impact on metabolic rate and body temperature by various mechanisms, in- cluding modulating mitochondrial activity, membrane composition and ion permeability, and substrate cycling (29). The relationship between longevity and hypothy- roidism is considered to be due to lower levels of reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress in re- sponse to changes in both obligate and facultative ther- mogenesis (30).

Our findings are consonant with studies of identical and fraternal twins that show a strong effect of genetic factors on serum free thyroid hormones and TSH. These studies support the idea that the thyroid function set point between free hormones and TSH are genetically deter- mined (16). These findings were further supported in Mexican-American families in the San Antonio Family Heart Study (17), which showed that genes controlled a substantial portion of the variation in thyroid hormones and suggested that identification of such genes could pro- vide important insight into processes that modulate thy- roid hormone-related metabolic effects.

The inverse correlation between serum TSH and FT4 concentrations in our study groups raises the possibility that mild, subclinical hypothyroidism might contribute to this phenotype. Whether hypothyroidism plays a direct role in human longevity remains to be determined. How- ever, multiple animal studies have shown a cause and ef- fectrelationshipbetweenthyroidfunctionandlifespan(7, 26). There are several comparative aging studies that in- volve animals with slow rates of aging. These animals demonstrate only minimal age-related deterioration in physiological capacity and reproduction and are resistant to chronic disease (8). Indeed, extraordinary longevity in animal models may be associated with exceptional anti- agingmechanisms,providinguniqueinsightsintoboththe genetics and physiology of longevity. One example of such a mammal is the naked mole-rat (NMR, Rodentia: Bathy- ergidae; Heterocephalus glaber), which has a life span of more than 28 yr, exceeding any other rodent of its size (8). Other examples of mammal longevity are the Ames and Snell dwarf mice and calorie-restricted (CR) rats (27). In- terestingly, all of these animals exhibit at least three com- mon hormonal and metabolic characteristics: reduced thyroid function, (absent TSH and severely reduced thy- roid hormone in Ames and Snell dwarf mice, reduced thy- roid function in NMR and CR rats), reduced basal met- abolic rate, and reduced core body temperature (8, 27). A causal relationship between thyroid function and longev- itywasfurtherdemonstratedbyexperimentalinductionof hypothyroidism in rats, which resulted in extended life span. Conversely, inducing hyperthyroidism resulted in significantly shorter life span (26, 28). Taken together, animal models of longevity demonstrate that hypothy- roidism, and the accompanying metabolic consequences of hypothyroidism, play a central physiological role in life

A limitation of our study is that, at present, our findings and conclusions are restricted to the Ashkenazi Jewish population and cannot be generalized to other popula- tions. Clearly, genetic studies in non-Ashkenazi popula- tions in North America would be of great interest in this regard. Others have reported on serum TSH in individuals of exceptional longevity, some showing increased concen- trations (2, 31) and others showing decreased concentra- tions (32, 33). None have reported on genetic changes as inthepresentwork.Wesuggestthatthosereportedstudies be interpreted cautiously because the study populations were small, have different genetic backgrounds from our study groups, and live in areas of variable iodine supply. Another limitation is that, because of lack of availability of serum in some individuals, we could not examine the relationship between FT4 and TSH in the entire control and offspring groups.

In our Ashkenazi populations, the higher serum TSH concentrations in the centenarian group and their off- spring suggest that they might have a small degree of hy- pothyroidism, possibly subclinical hypothyroidism. Be- cause nonthyroidal disease may decrease serum TSH, an alternative, but less likely, possibility is that the centenar- ians were in better overall health than the control group (34). Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised se- rum TSH in association with normal FT4, and it occurs in millions of people, particularly the elderly (1).

60 yr of age and rises steeply to 15% in individuals older than 80 yr of age (1). Because of population shifts in TSH distribution to higher concentrations with age, the serum TSH of 70% of those elderly individuals with TSH above 4.5 mIU/liter, who are currently considered to have sub- clinical hypothyroidism, actually falls within their age- specific limits (4). These recent reports suggest that only a minority of elderly individuals with minimally raised se- rum TSH may have thyroid disease.

Our present findings of a genetic basis for raised TSH in the Ashkenazi population with exceptional longevity, if extended to other populations in future studies, suggest that this change could be protective and, as a corollary to that speculation, that routine levothyroxine treatment might be harmful.
