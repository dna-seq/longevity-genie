Current literature indicates that abrogation of the IGF-I re- sponse pathway affects longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans, and that the down-regulation of IGF-I gene expression is as- sociated with an extension of the life span in mice. In this paper we tested the hypothesis that polymorphic variants of IGF-I response pathway genes, namely IGF-IR (IGF-I recep- tor; G/A, codon 1013), PI3KCB (phosphoinositol 3-kinase; T/C, (cid:1)359 bp; A/G, (cid:1)303 bp), IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1; G/A, codon 972), and FOXO1A (T/C, (cid:2)97347 bp), play a role in systemic IGF-I regulation and human longevity. The major findingofthisinvestigationwasthatsubjectscarryingatleast

an A allele at IGF-IR have low levels of free plasma IGF-I and are more represented among long-lived people. Moreover, ge- notype combinations at IGF-IR and PI3KCB genes affect free IGF-I plasma levels and longevity. These findings represent the first indication that free IGF-I plasma levels and human longevity are coregulated by an overlapping set of genes, con- tributingtothehypothesisthattheimpactoftheIGF-I/insulin pathway on longevity is a property that has been evolution- arily conserved throughout the animal kingdom. (J Clin En- docrinol Metab 88: 3299–3304, 2003)

AKT1/AKT2 kinases, affect the life span of the yeast (8). the basis of these data it has been predicted that genes volved in the insulin/IGF-I response pathway play a role longevity throughout evolution (9).

tions in genes that share similarities with the human genes involved in the insulin/IGF-I signal response pathway are responsible for an impairment of IGF-I/insulin signaling and for an extension of the Caenorhabditis elegans life span (1). In particular, the best characterized genes of this ancestral IGF-I/insulin response pathway are: DAF-2, ortholog to the human IGF-I/insulin receptor family; AGE-1, ortholog to human p110 catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which is involved in IGF-I/insulin signal transduction; and DAF-16, ortholog to the human FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors, which regulates IGF-I/insulin-induced changes in gene transcription (2–5).

A major role of IGF-I in mammalian longevity has been suggested by studies on dwarf mice carrying mutations in transcription factors PIT-1 and PROP-1, which are charac- terized by a long life span and reduced IGF-I plasma levels (10–12). Conversely, transgenic animals with elevated plasma IGF-I levels have a short life span (13). In humans there is evidence that long-lived subjects have decreased plasma IGF-I levels (14, 15) and preserved insulin action compared with aged subjects, thus indicating that an efficient insulin response has an impact on human longevity (16–18).

Further recent studies have shown that mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster INR gene (similar to the human in- sulin receptor) and in the CHICO gene, the ortholog to hu- man insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the protein associ- ated with the IGF-I/insulin receptor, affect the life span, confirming the hypothesis that the insulin/IGF-I response pathway plays a role in the regulation of invertebrate lon- gevity (6, 7).

On the basis of the above-mentioned literature, we inves- tigated the role of genetic variability at human loci that share similarities with the genes that regulate the insulin/IGF-I response in C. elegans (1–4) and D. melanogaster. In particular, polymorphisms at IGF-IR (IGF-I receptor; 34% protein se- quence identity with the C. elegans DAF-2 gene), PIK3CB (phosphoinositol 3-kinase; 27% protein sequence identity with the C. elegans AGE-1 gene), IRS-1 (30% protein sequence identity with the D. melanogaster CHICO gene), FOXO1A (49% protein sequence identity with the C. elegans DAF-16 gene) were investigated. Their effects on IGF-I plasma levels were assessed. Moreover, the genotype distributions found in long-lived people over 85 yr of age and those found in

people less than 85 yr old were compared. This strategy to select long-lived people from the population was based on three findings: 1) demographic data suggesting that the se- lection for longevity starts at about 85 yr (19); 2) demographic models predicting that changes in the frequency of poly- morphisms associated with different survival capabilities during aging are expected to occur beyond the age of 85 yr (20); and 3) previous data showing that people beyond the age of 85 yr have peculiar metabolic/anthropometric pa- rameters [such as high insulin sensitivity, low body mass index (BMI), and low glycemia] in comparison with the rest of the aging population (18). All of these data suggest that healthy people over 85 yr of age have been highly selected

In a subset of 211 individuals, direct sequencing of a 203-bp region ott aii (position 4703 267) of the PIK3CB promoter was performed   (CEQ2000, Beckman) using primers 5 -GAA AAACTCAGCCTAA- GAAGC-3(cid:3) (upstream) and 5(cid:3) -AATCCATACCACCAACTAAAG-3(cid:3) iwt—3 (downstream) to detect a polymorphism A3G at 303 bp upstream as described by Kossila et al. (24). This procedure allowed confirmation of   the data on the site T3C located at 359 bp and proved that no other polymorphic loci were present in that DNA region.

The region of exon I surrounding the G to A transition at codon 972 ofIRS-1(chromosome2q35-q36.1,GI:5031804)wasamplifiedbyprimers Vis5! 1,  5 -GCAGCCTGGCAGGAGAG-3 (upstream) and 5 -CTCACCTC- NIN CTCTGCAGC-3 (downstream). The 220-bp PCR product was digested with BstNI (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). The presence of the restriction site (allele A) generated two fragments of 164 and 56 bp, which were run on a 4.0% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.

The fragment of 296 bp spanning the T to C transition at position +9 97347 in intron I of the FOXO1A gene (GenBank GI:17476061, chro-   mosome 13q14.1) was amplified by primers 5 -CCTGGTAAAACCG- muir   GAAGGT-3 (upstream) and 5 -CCCTTCCTTTGGAATGACTG-3 (downstream) and digested with SspI (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The presence of the T allele allowed cutting of the amplified region in two fragments of 186 and 110 bp.

Subjects and Methods

Subjects

Four hundred ninety-six Caucasian subjects (132 men and 364 wom- en), from 18–109 yr of age, equally distributed in northern, central, and southern Italy, volunteered for this study. On the basis of literature data (18–20), to assess the impact of genes on longevity, subjects were then subcategorized into two groups by splitting the sample at the age of 85 aban=!  yr: healthy people 17–85 yr of age (n 278; mean age, 54.8 21.5; male/female ratio, 76/202) were grouped as “young people,” and    healthy people from 86–109 yr of age (n 218; mean age, 98.0 4.31 male/female ratio, 56/162) were grouped as “long-lived people.” All subjects were contacted at home or their institutions and examined by physicians previously trained to administer a questionnaire that in- cludedcognitiveanddepressiontests.Allsubjectshadliver,kidney,and thyroid function tests within the normal range. According to American Diabetes Association criteria (21), no subject was diabetic or affected by impaired fasting glucose. No subject used drugs affecting insulin se- cretion and/or action or plasma lipid levels. In particular, long-lived subjects represented a group of carefully selected individuals free of major age-related diseases. After a clear explanation of the potential risk of the study, all subjects (as well as the relatives of the long-lived people) gave informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethical committee of our institutions.

Calculations and statistical analyses

Thedegreeofinsulinresistance(IR)wasestimatedbythehomeostatic model assessment (HOMA) method (25, 26). The HOMA method has been recently validated to be a good index of insulin resistance (IR) in subjects with a broad range of insulin sensitivity (25) and has a good correlation with the insulin-mediated glucose uptake calculated by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp (26). To approximate nor- mal distributions, plasma insulin and IR (HOMA) were logarithmically transformed and used in all calculations and were back-transformed for resultpresentations.Thedifferenceingenotypefrequencywasanalyzed by (cid:1)2 test. For investigating the difference in allele frequency, Fisher’s test was used. ANOVA with Scheffe´’s test was used for comparing IGF-I plasma levels among the genotype groups. A linear general model analysis was used to test the independent contributions of the interac- tions between the different genotypes as well as the effect of individual genotype on plasma IGF-I levels. A t test with a Bonferroni-adjusted ‘yrS) aN (p ) value was used when indicated. Statistical analyses were per- adj formed using the SPSS software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). All  metabolic parameters are presented as the mean sd.

Analytical methods

Anthropometric determinations (weight, height, and BMI) were mea- sured as previously reported (22). Plasma glucose was determined by theglucoseoxidasemethod(GlucoseAutoanalyzer,Beckman,Fullerton, CA). Subsequently centrifugation plasma insulin (Sorin Biomedica, Mi- suse,L + ( lan Italy; intraassay coefficient of variation, 3.1 0.3%) and free plasma IGF-I levels (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX; intraassay demeee5 + | coefficients of variation, 3.8 0.4%) were determined by RIA.

Results

In the entire population, free IGF-I plasma levels displayed an age-related decrease (Fig. 1) through all ages and were ee  negatively correlated with the degree of IR (HOMA; , 0.132; S6He<< “YY ior<<

Genotype typing

In all study groups, the genotype distributions were in the se>| Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P 0.05).

DNA was extracted from white blood cells by phenol/chloroform extraction, according to standard procedures (23).

The impact of genetic variability at IGF-IR, PIK3CB, IRS-1, and FOXO1A loci on plasma IGF-I levels was tested by uni- variate analysis (Table 1). IGF-IR and PIK3CB genotypes affected IGF-I plasma levels, whereas no change in IGF-I plasma levels was observed according to genotypes of IRS-1 and FOXO1A loci.

Accordingly, the effects of IGF-IR and PIK3CB polymor- phisms on IGF-I plasma levels were assessed by means of a general linear model ANOVA, including age, sex, IR (HOMA), and BMI as covariates (Table 2).

All other comparisons adj among IGF-IR/PIK3CB genotype combinations were not sig- nificant (Fig. 2).

The genotype frequency distributions at IGF-IR, PIK3CB, IRS-1, and FOXO1A loci in young people and long-lived people were studied in the two groups. Carriers of the A vel‘ue allele (A subjects) at the IGF-IR locus were more repre- sented among long-lived people than in young people (Table 3). No significant differences were found when PIK3CB, IRS-1, and FOXO1A gene polymorphisms were examined.

is evidence that centenarians, the best example of successful aging, have lower plasma IGF-I levels (14, 15). Interestingly, caloric restriction, the most reproducible intervention to ex- tend animal life span (28), substantially reduces plasma free IGF-I levels (29, 30).

In accordance with previous studies (16–18, 22), remark- ably low IR as well as BMI were found in our sample of long-lived people, confirming that these individuals show metabolic characteristics different from those in the rest of aging population. To date no genetics have been found that can be associated with these parameters (18); it cannot be excluded that BMI and IR (HOMA) as well as plasma IGF-I (whose variance was explained by only 13% by the variables used in this report) could be influenced by the peculiar nu- tritional regimen of these long-lived people, which could, in fact, share some similarities with moderate caloric restriction. In this regard, the preserved insulin pathway efficiency ob- served in long-lived subjects might be indirectly due to an enhanced tissue response to IGF-I secondary to an increase in IGF-I receptor number/activity (30). Our previous study (14) demonstrated that centenarians had a plasma IGF-I/ IGFBP-3 molar ratio greater than that of aged subjects. This finding appears to contradict the present study, because the greater molar ratio was due to the lower IGFBP-3 present in long-lived subjects rather than to higher IGF-I plasma levels (no significant difference in total plasma IGF-I levels was found among long-lived and aged subjects), thus suggesting that in centenarians the bioavailability of IGF-I is enhanced despite its lower levels. The significance of plasma IGF-I remains to be established. It could be hypothesized that the decrease in plasma IGF-I observed in long-lived subjects might minimize the generalized mitogenic stimulus to tis- sues and contribute to the reduction in age-related pathol- ogies due to the effect of IGF-I on cellular replication. Such

Discussion

The major findings of this investigation are the following: 1) IGF-I plasma levels, which decrease significantly with age, are affected by the polymorphisms at IGF-IR and PI3CKB genes, both alone and in combination. In particular, indi- viduals bearing at least one allele A at the IGF-IR locus wee\ +) (IGF-IR A ) have lower plasma IGF-I levels than the rest of the population. 2) IGF-IR A(cid:5) subjects are found in increased proportion in long-lived individuals. 3) Genotype combina- tions of an A allele at the IGF-IR locus and a T allele at the PI3CKB locus (A(cid:5) /T(cid:5) subjects) affect IGF-I plasma levels (having A(cid:4) /T(cid:4) individuals the highest free IGF-I plasma levels), as well as longevity, and the proportion of A(cid:5) /T(cid:5) subjects significantly increased among long-lived individuals.

Collectively, these data suggest that genetic variants of genes involved in the intracellular response to IGF-I (IGF-IR and PI3CKB) jointly affect two phenotypes: free IGF-I plasma levels and longevity. The fact that the two traits are coregu- lated by overlapping sets of genes is in line with previous findings on the genetics of longevity in animal models. In- deed, in both invertebrates (C. elegans) and mammals (Mus musculus), the down-regulation of the IGF-I pathway or IGF-I plasma levels is associated with an extension of the life span (9–12, 27), whereas animals with elevated plasma IGF-I lev- els display a shortened life span (13). Indeed, in humans there

the insulin/IGF-I signaling response pathway plays a role in human longevity, indicating that the impact of these genes on species longevity is an evolutionarily conserved property. We hope that our data will be the starting point for future longitudinal studies, including the insulin response pathway genes as a possible trigger for longevity.

a hormone is also linked to the development of several dis- eases, such as cancer (31, 32), but the local expression (bio- availability) of IGF-I may be an important factor contributing to the maintenance of normal tissue function.

To our knowledge the results reported here are the first findings supporting the hypothesis that genetic variability in the genes responsible for IGF-I regulation plays a role in human longevity. The ortholog of human IGF-IR, DAF-2, is one of the best characterized longevity genes in C. elegans (1–3). It has been proposed that DAF-2 mutations lead to the up-regulation of genes involved in heat stress, UV, and an- tioxidant responses, i.e. pathways that are expected to affect the life span in all species (33). Furthermore, it has been recently shown that IGF-IR inactivation prologs the life span in mice and increases their resistance to oxidative stress (34). However, the functional effects of the structural variation in IGF-IR due to the polymorphism studied here are not known.

The association design is a potential limitation of our study, and a longitudinal study might provide more robust data. Unfortunately, no longitudinal studies in humans have been performed to obtain more robust conclusions, espe- cially in long-lived subjects ((cid:7) 85 yr of age), in which a long follow-up period would be extremely difficult to achieve. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the rationale for assessing the potential role of the IGF-I signaling pathway on longevity derives from a large number of studies performed in laboratory models of longevity and in which a cause-effect mechanism has already been proven.
