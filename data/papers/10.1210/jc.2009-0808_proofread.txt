arm of chromosome 1 (1p13.3- p12) (25). The TSHR gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 14 (14q31-q32.1) and spans approximately 60 kb with 10 exons (26). We selected SNPs in the TSH-B and TSHR genes based on their known or potential functional effects and/or their previous association with thyroid function (18, 19, 27). We genotyped two SNPs in the TSH-B gene promoter/enhancer region (rs179247 and rs12101255) and five SNPs in the TSHR gene (rs12050077, rs10149689, rs10995190, rs2239130, and rs2231280) using a custom-designed Illumina GoldenGate assay (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The genotyping success rate was greater than 96% for all SNPs. The minor allele frequencies of these SNPs were greater than 0.05 in our study population. All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each group separately and in the pooled groups.  Statistical analyses  Data are presented as means S.E.M., unless otherwise noted. Comparison of continuous variables between two groups was performed using an unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Comparison of categorical variables between two groups was performed using a chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Correlations between two continuous variables were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Heritability estimates were calculated using the SOLAR program (28). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between SNPs and longevity status after adjusting for age and sex. Haplotype frequency was estimated using the EH program (29). Linkage disequilibrium coefficient r2 was calculated using Haploview software (30). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), unless otherwise noted.Arm of chromosome 1. We selected four SNPs (rs10494170, rs12046203, rs12740035, and rs7523360) of TSH-B gene and genotyped them in both Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and controls. The allelic frequencies of these SNPs between the Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and controls did not show significant differences. Due to the association between TSH receptor (TSHR) and TSH expression, we further examined SNPs in this gene. SNPs (rs12050077 and rs10149689) were genotyped using the PSQ HS 96A Pyrosequencer, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pyrosequencing, Uppsala, Sweden; www.pyrosequencing.com). Briefly, a PCR product was generated from a primer pair that included one primer covalently coupled to biotin, the biotinylated template was bound to streptavidin-coated Sepharose HP beads, and this mixture was then annealed to a sequencing primer. Stepwise elongation of a sequencing primer strand upon sequential addition of a specified sequence of deoxynucleotide triphosphates and the degradation of nucleotides by apyrase were carried out simultaneously. As the sequencing reaction progressed, the DNA strand was extended, and the sequence was determined from the measured signal output of light upon nucleotide incorporation. The resulting peaks in the pyrogram were analyzed using Pyrosequencing software. Primer sequences are available from the authors upon request. Error rates based on blind replicates were estimated to be 0.5%. Stated age was verified by checking birth certificates or U.S. passports. Jewish religion was self-reported (mother and father Jewish), and subjects were considered Ashkenazi Jews if their four grandparents were originally Ashkenazi Jews. Information on medical history, demographic characteristics, and clinical data were obtained uniformly using a structured questionnaire. All subjects underwent a physical examination and were asked to provide a blood sample. Informed written consent was obtained in accordance with the policy of the Committee on Clinical Investigation of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Exclusion criteria included acute or debilitating medical conditions.

Serum TSH Distribution Statistical Analysis Serum TSH concentrations in the offspring were significantly higher compared with controls [median, 97.5% CI: 1.68 (0.65-4.79) and 1.55 (0.63-3.93) mIU/liter, respectively; P < 0.02; Table 1). Moreover, serum TSH distribution was also shifted to higher TSH concentrations in offspring compared with controls, including the TSH concentrations at peak frequency (Fig. 1), suggesting a population shift phenomenon. TSH distribution in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, recently published (4) and shown only for comparative purposes, was further shifted to higher TSH concentrations (Fig. 1) compared with offspring, suggesting a genetic predisposition for higher TSH.

All analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS Institute, Cary NC), version 9.12. Because serum TSH and FT4 were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests including the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA by ranks and Mann-Whitney rank sum test were used for group comparisons. A chi-square test was performed to compare the difference in TSHR genotype frequencies. Genotype frequencies of all SNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Because two SNPs (in the TSHR) were involved in an independent new assay, the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used; thus, the threshold for statistical significance was P < 0.025. Given that this is a relatively homogeneous population, tests for population stratification were not performed. The haplotype association test between cases (Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians) and controls was performed using Haploview 4 software (http://www.broad.institut.org/haploview/haploview). Wilcoxon statistics were calculated to test homogeneity between the groups.

To determine whether medications taken by participants may affect TSH concentration, we applied a linear regression model where serum TSH levels served as a dependent variable, and various medications taken by our study subjects served as independent variables; no significant effect of any medication was detected. Furthermore, stepwise regression of a mixed model, where the probability to enter was 0.25 and the probability to leave was 0.05, demonstrated that none of the medications had any significant effect on serum TSH. Drug categories and the percentage of subjects using the drugs are listed in Table 2, as well as the percentage of subjects taking one or more drugs.

Frequencies for these SNPs were not significantly different between offspring and centenarians. Linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs was high (r2>0.95), suggesting interaction between them. The frequency of GA haplotype was significantly greater among both Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and their offspring compared with controls (0.57 and 0.53 vs. 0.46; P<0.0001 and P<0.01, respectively). With adjustment for gender, we found that the median TSH in those who had rs10149689 (G allele) and rs12050077 (A allele) was significantly higher than those who had neither of the alleles [median (97.5% CI), 1.42 (0.56 to 3.33) vs. 1.68 (0.63 to 6.06) mIU/liter in controls, P=0.02; and 1.49 (0.46 to 3.74) vs. 1.70 (0.68 to 5.38) mIU/liter, P=0.049 in offspring]. Similarly, the median TSH level in the combined groups (control and offspring) associated with GA haplotype was significantly higher compared with the individuals without the GA [median (97.5% CI), 1.78 (0.59 to 7.01) vs.1.54 (0.50 to 5.29) mIU/liter; P=0.04]. 

FIG. 4. Heritability analysis of serum TSH in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians (probands) and their offspring.

We found a moderate degree of heritability (h2=0.32; P=0.007) for serum TSH in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and their offspring (Fig. 4). To examine further the role of genetic factors, we performed a case-control genetic analysis of TSH and TSHR variants (4 and 2, respectively). The SNPs were part of a larger group of SNPs in an independent dataset comprised of individuals from the same genetic origin.

Although the SNPs in the TSH-B dataset did not show significant changes between cases and controls, the SNPs in the TSHR did show significant differences.

Thus, we chose to examine those SNPs using a different technology and an independent dataset.

The allelic frequency for SNPs in the TSHR gene was significantly different comparing Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and controls [rs10149689 G allele frequency, 0.57 vs. 0.48; P<0.001, odds ratio (OR), 1.56 and (rs12050077 A allele frequency, 0.57 vs. 0.46; P<0.0001; OR 1.68). Allelic frequency also differed between the offspring and controls (rs10149689 G allele frequency, 0.53 vs. 0.48; P=0.08; OR 1.22; and rs12050077 A allele frequency, 0.53 vs. 0.46; P=0.01; OR 1.32; Fig. 5).

Carriers of the favorable allele in the combined groups (offspring and control) have higher TSH levels [median (97.5% CI), 1.70 (0.59 to 5.34) vs.1.45 (0.50 to 3.99) mIU/liter; P=0.005], suggesting that the high prevalence of the TSHR SNPs is associated with higher serum TSH levels.

However, when the centenarians' data were(26, 28). Taken together, animal models of longevity demonstrate that hypothyroidism, and the accompanying metabolic consequences of hypothyroidism, play a central physiological role in life. A limitation of our study is that, at present, our findings and conclusions are restricted to the Ashkenazi Jewish population and cannot be generalized to other populations. Clearly, genetic studies in non-Ashkenazi populations in North America would be of great interest in this regard. Others have reported on serum TSH in individuals of exceptional longevity, some showing increased concentrations (2, 31) and others showing decreased concentrations (32, 33). None have reported on genetic changes as in the present work. We suggest that those reported studies be interpreted cautiously because the study populations were small, have different genetic backgrounds from our study groups, and live in areas of variable iodine supply. Another limitation is that, because of the lack of availability of serum in some individuals, we could not examine the relationship between FT4 and TSH in the entire control and offspring groups. In our Ashkenazi populations, the higher serum TSH concentrations in the centenarian group and their offspring suggest that they might have a small degree of hypothyroidism, possibly subclinical hypothyroidism. Because nonthyroidal disease may decrease serum TSH, an alternative but less likely possibility is that the centenarians were in better overall health than the control group (34). Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH in association with normal FT4 and it occurs in millions of people, particularly the elderly (1). The prevalence of TSH above 4.5 mIU/liter is less than 2% in people without known thyroid disease who are between 20 and 60 years of age and rises steeply to 15% in individuals older than 80 years of age (1). Because of population shifts in TSH distribution to higher concentrations with age, the serum TSH of 70% of those elderly individuals with TSH above 4.5 mIU/liter, who are currently considered to have subclinical hypothyroidism, actually falls within their age-specific limits (4). These recent reports suggest that only a minority of elderly individuals with minimally raised serum TSH may have thyroid disease. Our present findings of a genetic basis for raised TSH in the Ashkenazi population with exceptional longevity, if extended to other populations in future studies, suggest that this change could be protective and, as a corollary to that speculation, that routine levothyroxine treatment might be harmful.
