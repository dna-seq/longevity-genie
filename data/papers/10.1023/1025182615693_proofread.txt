The allele (A) in the promoter region of the HSP70-1 gene is unfavorable to longevity in women. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are crucial for maintaining cell homeostasis and survival during and after various stresses, affecting the chance of health and survival at the organismal level. We investigated whether the gene pool relevant to the (A/C)110 polymorphism in the promoter region of the HSP70-1 gene changes as the population ages and survival selection occurs. A total of 591 southern Italian subjects were enrolled in the study, free of clinically manifest diseases and with normal hematological and chemical parameters. A significant age-related decrease in the frequency of allele (A)110 was observed in females. The probability ratio of 0.403 (95% confidence interval [0.163, 0.910]) computed by considering female centenarians as cases and young women (18-49 years old) as controls showed that the (A)110 allele is unfavorable to longevity in females.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a crucial role in stress response as molecular chaperones, which is conserved during evolution and likely involved in mechanisms modulating human aging. HSP70-1 is a gene encoding for Hsp70 protein, one of the major inducible heat shock proteins. An A/C polymorphism lies in the HSE region of the HSP70-1 gene at 110 nt from the transcription starting site, which was analyzed by automatic DNA sequencing.

A total of 591 unrelated subjects were analyzed, including 263 males and 328 females with median ages of 57.0 and 56.5 years, respectively, with an age range of 18-109 years. The age-related trajectories of both allele (A)110 frequencies and genotypes carrying allele (A)110 were analyzed by the least squares method, showing a significant age-related decrease in the frequency of allele (A)110 in females. The odds ratio (O.R.) relevant to allele (A)110 was computed by taking carriers of allele (A)110 in the 90-109 years age class as cases and those in the 18-29 plus 30-49 years age class as controls, showing that the (A)110 allele is unfavorable to longevity in females.

In conclusion, the study shows that the allele (A)110 in the promoter region of the HSP70-1 gene is unfavorable to longevity in women. The research also suggests that HSP genes are good candidates for investigating gene factors that affect the rate and quality of human aging.Reliability of such studies: i) the homogeneity of the population, to avoid confounding factors due to population stratification; ii) the selection of the candidate gene, which should be based on strong biological hints (Tabor et al. 2002). The data presented here show that the (A/C)110 variability in the promoter region of the HSP70-1 gene is associated, in women, with the probability of survival to oldest age (O.R. = 0.403, with 95% c.i. [0.163, 0.910]). This positive association seems to be reliable and not due to population stratification, taking into account data regarding the structure and demographic history of the Calabrian population (Rose et al. 1996; Danubio et al. 1999; Baudi 2001). Moreover, the biological role of Hsp70 proteins in stress response and the link between stress response and aging ascertained in model organisms (Minois 2000) reinforce the choice of HSP70-1 gene as a candidate gene in human gene/longevity association studies. 

Results: In order to verify whether the genotypic/allelic pool changed as the population aged and selection for health or survival occurred, both female and male samples were subdivided into five age classes (18-29 years, 30-49 years, 50-69 years, 70-89 years, 90-109 years) and the (A/C)110 genotypic/allelic frequencies were estimated in each age class. Data are reported in Table 1. In each age class, and in both sexes, the observed genotypes were in agreement with those expected at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05).

Linear regression analysis was then applied to allele frequency data. In females (Figure 1), a decreasing trend of the frequency of allele (A)110 was observed with increasing age. The estimated value of the slope coefficient of the regression line, b = -0.0018, was significantly lower than zero because the 95% empirical confidence interval (c.i.) of 1 was [0.0030, 0.0005]. Moreover, the frequency of the allele (A)110 carriers (AA plus AC genotypes) showed a significant decrease with increasing age (b1 = -0.0013, 95% c.i. of 1 [-0.0027, -0.00013]). The age-related decrease of allele (A)110 indicated that this allele is unfavorable to female longevity. To check this indication, we estimated the O.R. relevant to allele (A)110 by assuming as cases the carriers of allele (A)110 in the 90-109 years age class and as controls those in the 18-29 plus 30-49 years age class (Table 1a). It should be noted that both allelic and genotypic frequency distributions were different between cases and controls (χ2 = 7.76, P = 0.005 for alleles; χ2 = 8.07, P = 0.018 for genotypes). The O.R. of 0.403 (95% c.i. [0.163, 0.910]) confirmed that the (A)110 allele is unfavorable for longevity in women.

By the concordance of the present data with the analogous data reported for the HLA-DR locus, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the (A/C)110 polymorphism (Cascino et al. 1993a,b). Indeed, a female-specific association has been reported between some alleles of the HLA-DR locus and longevity (Ivanova et al. 1998). These results clearly indicate that the chromosomal region surrounding HLA-DR and HSP70-1 loci harbors variants that can affect human longevity. The (A/C)110 polymorphism of HSP70-1 may be one of the variants that play this role in the above chromosomal region. The (A/C)110 marker lies in HSF1-HSE binding domain of HSP70-1 (Abravayata et al. 1991). Although this polymorphism was reported not to affect either HSE-HSF binding or hsp70 protein synthesis (Favatier et al. 1999), the possibility that allele (A)110 and allele (C)110 may have slightly different binding efficiency in very old organisms is a reasonable hypothesis. In fact, from a biological point of view, aging is a stressful condition which implies a profound reshaping of most physiological functions (Franceschi et al. 2000c). Allele (A)110 may have lower efficiency than allele (C)110 in coping with such a stressful condition, which is also accompanied byFavatier F, Jacquier-Sarlin MR, Swierczewski E and Polla - Polymorphism in the regulatory sequence of the human hsp gene does not affect heat shock factor binding or shock protein synthesis.

Hum Mol Genet: On the other hand, it is intriguing to note that HSF-1 is under positive regulation by estrogen hormones (Yang et al. 1995; Knowlton and Sun 2001), and this is in line with the different effects of (A/C)110 alleles in the two genders. It is worth noticing, however, that a variety of genes affecting longevity in a sex-specific way have been reported, both for humans (Ivanova et al. 1998; Tan et al. 2001; De Luca et al. 2001; Bonafe et al. 2001; Lio et al. 2002) and model organisms (Jackson et al. 2002; Leips and Mackay 2002). Since the present study is a cross-sectional one, mortality of genotypes may depend on the birth year of the cohort for oldest-old people (De Benedictis et al. 2001). If this were the case, the (A/C)110 polymorphism may affect survival in historically specific environments, rather than longevity. In any case, the study carried out in a well-defined and homogeneous population has shown that the allele (A)110 of the HSP70-1 gene, which is a strong candidate for affecting lifespan on the basis of studies in model organisms, is unfavorable to longevity in women. physiology.
