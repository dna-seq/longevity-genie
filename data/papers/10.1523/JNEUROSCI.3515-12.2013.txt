Longevity is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The brain’s dopamine system may be particularly relevant, since it modulatestraits(e.g.,sensitivitytoreward,incentivemotivation,sustainedeffort)thatimpactbehavioralresponsestotheenvironment. In particular, the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) has been shown to moderate the impact of environments on behavior and health. We tested the hypothesis that the DRD4 gene influences longevity and that its impact is mediated through environmental effects. Surviving  0+. participants of a 30-year-old population-based health survey (N 310; age range, 90–109 years; the 90 Study) were genotyped/ y= 2 resequenced at the DRD4 gene and compared with a European ancestry-matched younger population (N 2902; age range, 7–45 years).

Introduction

Undoubtedly, genetic factors contribute to both longevity (Sebastiani et al., 2012) and health among the oldest-old (Martin et al., 2007). Surprisingly, little attention has been directed to- ward genes that influence personality as “longevity genes” (Eaton et al., 2012). This is puzzling not only because the impact of life-style choices on longevity is self-evident (e.g., smoking and early death from pulmonary disease or cancer), but also because of the strong genetic contributions to human personality

 Individuals 90 years of age constitute the fastest growing segment of our population (Fig. 1) (Day, 1996), yet little is known about the factors that contribute to their extreme lon- gevity. Addressing this gap would help develop smarter strat- egies to increase the number of people who reach old age in good health.

A good example is the human dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene, whose associations with the personality trait of novelty seeking (MIM 601696) (Kluger et al., 2002; Gillespie et al., 2003) and with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (MIM 126452) (Faraone et al., 2001; Grady et al., 2003, 2005; Li et al., 2006) havebeenreplicatednumeroustimes.TheDRD4geneexhib- its an unusually high amount of expressed polymorphism (Fig. 1, inset). Most of this variation is the result of a 48 bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), located in exon 3 that encodes the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Alleles containing from 2 to 11 repeats (2R to 11R) have been identified, with the three most com- mon variants (2R, 4R, and 7R) accounting for Mis 51 >9 90% of the allelic diversity (Ding et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004).

been studied extensively. The 7R variant shows a blunted re- sponse to dopamine when compared with the 4R variant (As- ghari et al., 1995; Jovanovic et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2004) and does not form heteromers with the short isoform of the presyn- aptic dopamine D2 receptor (Borroto-Escuela et al., 2011; Gonza´lez et al., 2012). The DRD4 protein is expressed in several brain regions, with high levels in prefrontal cortex (Oak et al., 2000). DRD4 knock-out mice display better performance on complex motor tasks and reduced exploration of novel stimuli (Rubinstein et al., 1997; Dulawa et al., 1999). ADHD individuals with a 7R allele have faster reaction times than non-7R individu- als (Swanson et al., 2000; Langley et al., 2004).

is significantly associated with lower mortality risks (15–35%), and is not confounded by smoking, alcohol intake, caffeine consumption, body mass index (BMI), or a history of hypertension, angina, heart attack, stroke, dia- betes, rheumatoid arthritis, or cancer (Paganini-Hill et al., 2011).

Two hundred seventy participants had complete information available from the Leisure World Cohort Study (Paganini-Hill et al., 2011). Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established for all 310 participants, using a modified protocol involving up to 5 months of cell culture (Grady et al., 2003). Detailed ancestry information was col- 0+ lectedfromthe90 Studyparticipantstoconfirmself-declaredancestryfor matchingtoEuropeanancestrypopulation-basedcontrolsampleDRD4ge-  notypes (N 2902) from ongoing studies (Ding et al., 2002; Grady et al., 2003, 2005; Wang et al., 2004). Controls ranged in age from 7 to 45 years of age (mostly adolescents and college students). Previously established meth- odstogenotypeandresequencetheDRD4VNTRvariantwereused(Dinget al., 2002; Grady et al., 2003, 2005; Wang et al., 2004). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in other genes used as controls were genotyped by DNA sequencing. The Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Irvine, approved all procedures.

Given that the DRD4 7R allele is associated with increased activity/novelty-seeking in children and young adults (Faraone et al., 2001; Kluger et al., 2002; Grady et al., 2003, 2005; Li et al., 2006), we hypothesized that this allele would be associated with increased physical activity in the elderly. In addition, since phys- ical activity is associated with increased lifespan and health (Adlard et al., 2005; Larson et al., 2006; Willcox et al., 2006; Paganini-Hill et al., 2011), we hypothesized that the DRD4 7R allele would be over-represented in the oldest old.

Genotypes obtained for the 90 sample were as follows: 6 2R/2R, 27 2R/4R, 4 2R/7R, 4 3R/3R, 25 3R/4R, 7 3R/7R, 135 4R/4R, 1 4R/5R, 3 4R/6R, 82 4R/7R, 1 4R/11R, 1 5R/6R, 1 5R/7R, 1 6R/6R, 11 7R/7R, and 1 7R/8R. The genotypes of the control individuals were as follows: 60 2R/ 2R, 16 2R/3R, 345 2R/4R, 1 2R/5R, 58 2R/7R, 1 2R/8R, 4 3R/3R, 127 3R/4R, 17 3R/7R, 1715 4R/4R, 5 4R/5R, 1 4R/6R, 493 4R/7R, 1 4R/8R, 1 4R/9R, 2 5R/5R, 2 5R/7R, 2 6R/7R, and 51 7R/7R. There were no signif- icant deviations from the expected Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.  Observed allele frequencies for the oldest-old sample were 2R 0.07,  aks       3R 0.06, 4R 0.66, 5R 0.005, 6R 0.009, 7R 0.189, and 8R 0.0016. Observed allele frequencies for the population and ancestry-       oan  a aeR< matched controls were 2R 0.09, 3R 0.03, 4R 0.76, 5R 0.002, 6R    atk R< ( 0.001, 7R 0.12, 8R 0.001, and 9R 0.001. The DRD4 7R/x category contains individuals with at least one 7R (or derived 7R, i.e., 5R, 6R, 8R, 9R, 10R, and 11R) allele, and the non-7R/x category the remaining individuals (Dingetal.,2002;Wangetal.,2004).Arepresentativesampleof140oldest- old individuals was resequenced at the DRD4 exon 3 polymorphism to de-

The Study cohort (N 1151) consists of all participants aged ae1=9 90 years who were alive on January 1, 2003, and were part of the initial Leisure World Cohort Study (Corrada et al., 2008; Paganini-Hill et al., 2011). The Leisure World Cohort Study was estab- lished in 1981, when a health survey was mailed to all residents who at that time owned homes in the Leisure World retirement community, Laguna Woods, California. A total of 13,979 residents (61%) returned the questionnaire and constitute this cohort. The median age of subjects when they joined the cohort was 73 years (range, 44–107 years). Reflect- ing the characteristics of the community, the cohort was primarily of Europeanancestry(98%)andhighlyeducated(67%withsomecollegeto advanced degree). An additional questionnaire on current (2003 to pres- ent) activity levels was obtained from 233 participants, using questions appropriate for this age group.

Allele frequencies at 20 randomly chosen polymorphisms in nine unrelated genomic regions (CFTR, ERCC8, ERBB4, FANCC, HTERT, NRF1, RTN1, SLC6A3, and UCP3) did not differ significantly among the oldest-old individuals, younger control individuals, or HapMap European ancestry populations (International HapMap Consortium et al., 2007).

termine the haplotype (273 alleles). The common 7R(1-2-6-5-2-5-4) haplotype or 7R derivatives were the predominant 7R sequences, with the fraction of common to rare haplotypes similar to that observed in prior population studies (Ding et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004).

and homozygous knock-out (KO) mice (Rubinstein et al., 1997) were assigned to either an enriched environment (EE; housed with other mice and with access to toys and running wheels) or a deprived environment (DE; housed in isolation in standard cages) and maintained under these conditions for their lifespan. Mice were divided into six groups distin- guished by their genotype (WT, HT, and KO) and environmental exposure (EE and DE) with the following sample sizes: WT (DE ahi’  66, EE  51), HT (DE   31, EE  26), and KO (DE  34, EE ry a \ey 34). Age at time of death was recorded for all animals following guidelines previ- ouslyoutlined(Ullman-Cullere´ andFoltz,1999).Locomotoractivitywas tested bimonthly for 90 min using an activity monitoring system (Mini Mitter). Differences in longevity and locomotor activity between groups were assessed using SAS 9.1 and STRATA 7.0. Experiments followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Quimby et al., 2010).

In the oldest-old, we also observed a significant association between the 7R/x genotype and higher reported activity levels in both males and females (Fig. 3). This association was observed not only for measures obtained in 1981, when the mean self- reported activity level differed by 45% (1.42 vs 0.98 h; (cid:2)2 me 5.07, p <p»= 0.024 when measured as a categorical variable; and t   2.40, os»= p 0.018 when measured as a continuous variable), but also when the measured variable was current self-reported activity ((cid:2)2  4.43, sim 24= | p 0.033). Oldest-old participants with the DRD4 7R/x genotype 5 >? were twice as likely to report exercising 2 h/d in 1981 (top 20%; (cid:2)2 “iw &' 17.33, p  1.64 “<P 10(cid:4)5; Fig. 3). The correlation of higher activity with DRD4 7R/x genotype was not confounded by age, gen- der, alcohol intake, BMI, or medical history, similar to results ob- tainedinthelargerLeisureWorldcohort(Paganini-Hilletal.,2011). The proportion of the variance in physical activity explained by DRD4 7R in this oldest-old population was r2 en. 0.023.

Results

To test our hypothesis, we determined DRD4 exon 3 VNTR ge- notypes/sequences for 310 90(cid:2) study individuals (the “oldest- old”; mean age, 95.2 years; age range, 90–109 years; 91 males) >t~] (Fig. 1). These individuals represent 1.4–2.9% of their initial birth cohort and, by definition, should have altered allele fre- quencies of genes that impact health and longevity. When com- pared with matched European ancestry controls of individuals VES 50–90 years younger (N 2902; age range, 7–45 years), the oldest-old had a 66% increase in observed 7R/x genotype (Fig. 2) (0.364 vs 0.219, (cid:2)2  33.28, p  3.5 wivxX 10(cid:4)9; (cid:3)2  0.026). This extremely small p value would be significant at a genome-wide level following Bonferroni correction. Comparing allele fre- quency rather than genotype, the frequency of the 7R allele is greater in the oldest-old population by 72% (0.205 vs 0.119, (cid:2)2  38.27, p aa NAS 6.15 aoe 10(cid:4)10). This increase was preferentially ob- served in females (0.393 vs 0.297 males, (cid:2)2  9.65, p )ac.( 0.002), among whom the difference was significant at a genome-wide level(0.393vs0.219,(cid:2)2(cid:1) 34.66,p(cid:1) 1.7(cid:3) 10(cid:4)9).Incontrast,the difference in males, while significant, did not reach genome-wide level significance (0.297 vs 0.219, (cid:2)2 i 3.11, p  0.034) (Fig. 2).

To test the association of the DRD4 gene with longevity and re- sponses to the environment directly, we compared the lifespans of mice that expressed DRD4 (HT and WT) versus those of KO mice (Rubinstein et al., 1997) that lacked the DRD4 gene, when reared in eitheraDE(standardlaboratorycage)orEE(groupcageswithmul- tiple options for physical activity and exploration) environment (Ullman-Cullere´ andFoltz,1999;Quimbyetal.,2010).DRD4geno- type significantly affected the lifespan (F  5.74, p ye A 0.004, (cid:4)2 pa  0.03; Fig. 4). DRD4 KO mice (N 68) had a 9.7% shorter lifespan oNSe (mean and SEs: 94.8 2.08 weeks; 95% CI, 91–99) than HT mice    aa} *<< (N 57; 104 1.82 weeks; 95% CI, 100–108; p 0.05), and 7% shorter than WT mice (N oy aH 117; 101.4   2.38 weeks; 95% CI, 97–106;p(cid:7) 0.05).Therearingenvironmentalsoinfluencedlongev- ity (F   10.58, p   0.001, (cid:4)2  0.03; Fig. 4).

Specifically, whereas the lifespan was in-

positive and negative, is modulated by the DRD4 7R variant (Sheese et al., 2007; Belsky et al., 2009; Das et al., 2011; Olsson et al., 2011). The reduced spontaneous lo- comotor activity observed in DRD4 KO mice compared with WT and HT mice (Fig. 5) supports this interpretation, as well as the higher reported physical activ- ity levels in oldest-old individuals with a DRD4 7R variant (Fig. 3). However, from our experimental design it cannot be de- termined whether the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on longevity in WT and HT mice is moderated through social factors rather than increased loco- motor activity per se.

The mechanism by which the DRD4 variants would differentially influence envi- ronmental responses is unclear. The variant DRD47Rproteinhasabluntedresponsefor cAMP reduction compared with the 4R protein(Asgharietal.,1995;Jovanovicetal., 1999; Swanson et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2004). Also, the DRD4 7R protein, unlike the DRD4 4R protein, does not form func- tional heteromers with the short presynap- tic isoform of the dopamine D2 receptor in the striatum (Borroto-Escuela et al., 2011; Gonza´lezetal.,2012).DysfunctionalD2-D4 7R heteromers may impair dopaminergic control of corticostriatal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Thus, it is plausible that either a dopamine signaling deficit or en- hanced glutamate release, mediated by DRD4 7R, could enhance reactivity to envi- ronmental stimuli.

While the biochemical/physiological significance of DRD4 variants is under continuing investigation, there is solid molecular evolutionary evidence that functional differences exist at this locus. Extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) surrounds the DRD4 7R allele in individ- uals sampled worldwide (compared with the random LD at the ancestral 4R allele), as determined by direct DNA resequenc- ing of the entire gene and genotyping of polymorphisms extending 100 kb in both directions (Ding et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004, 2006). The high frequency of an al- lele coupled with extensive LD is a power- ful indicator of recent adaptive selection (Wang et al., 2006; Hawks et al., 2007)

(LDD test). The pattern of LD decay surrounding the DRD4 7R allele, together with the highest LD near the VNTR decaying in both directions, suggests that the DRD4 7R VNTR is the “target” of this Darwinian selection, with a recent evolutionary origin Ma(~4 ( 40,000–50,000 years ago). Consistent with this recent evolu- tionary origin and the known biochemical differences noted above, we have speculated that a “response-ready” adaptation influenced by the DRD4 7R allele might have played a role in the Out-of-Africa human exodus (Ding et al., 2002; Wang et al.,

We have shown that a human DRD4 variant associated with ac- tivity in younger individuals is at higher observed frequency in the oldest-old (Figs. 1, 2, 3), and that the DRD4 gene in mice moderated the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on lifespan (Figs. 4, 5). These results are consistent with human studies showing that sensitivity to environmental factors, both

associated with higher BMI (Guo et al., 2007; Fuemmeler et al., 2008), except in African American populations, but few studies on DRD4/activity have been conducted except for individuals diag- nosed with ADHD (Swanson et al., 2000). Measurements of the 7s7 ~0 heritability of physical activity vary widely, with a value of 0.30 often reported (Pe´russe et al., 1989; Horimoto et al., 2011). The proportionofthevarianceinphysicalactivityexplainedbyDRD47R in the oldest-old population (Fig. 3) is r2  0.023, or mn)r~7 7.7% of the varianceattributabletogenesmeasuredinheritabilitystudies.How- ever,heritabilitystudiesassumethatmultipleadditivegenescontrib- utetothephenotype,butaninteractinggenemodel,asproposedfor the DRD4 7R/ADHD association (Grady et al., 2003), would make the contribution of DRD4 7R to the variance in activity level signif- icantlygreater(Zuketal.,2012).Clearly,furtherstudiesofDRD47R contributions to the variance of activity level in other populations should be pursed. Unfortunately, there are no genetic markers on commercially available genotyping arrays that are in strong LD with the DRD4 7R VNTR (Saccone et al., 2009), making direct genotyp- ing/sequencing essential.

In further discussing our findings, it is important to note their limitations. The ideal control for the genotype/haplotype frequen- cies of DRD4 alleles would have been the nonliving birth cohorts of our oldest-old population, which is clearly not possible. However, human gene frequencies cannot change radically in a few genera- tions, except following extreme population bottlenecks, which have not occurred in the last 100 years in European ancestry populations. A possible selective force that could have introduced intergenera- tional variation is the high mortality due to infectious disease expe- rienced early in life by this oldest-old cohort, which has been largely eliminated through the use of immunization and antibiotics in the younger cohort (Fig. 1). Thus, any hypothetical “resistance” allele might exhibit higher frequencies in the oldest-old population than currently observed, due to this environmental intervention. How- ever, it is unlikely that the DRD4 gene (or any of the three closest genesinmodestLDwithit:DEAF1,SCT,andMUPCDH)(Interna- tional Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004) would con- fer such resistance. Moreover, allele frequencies at 20 randomly chosen polymorphisms in nine unrelated genomic regions (CFTR, ERCC8, ERBB4, FANCC, HTERT, NRF1, RTN1, SLC6A3, and UCP3) did not differ significantly among the oldest-old individuals, younger control individuals, or HapMap European ancestry popu- lations(InternationalHapMapConsortiumetal,2007);norwasthe observed DRD4 7R male/female allele frequency bias (Fig. 2) found at any of these randomly chosen sites. It is difficult to conceive of a mechanismthatexplainsthevariationsinallelefrequenciesbetween males and females except for one that involves the functional signif- icanceoftheunderlyingvariantlocus.Wecannot,however,ruleout alternative behavioral possibilities to explain why 7R/x individuals are disproportionately found in our specific cohort, such as the abil- ity/desire to live in a planned retirement community with good ac- cess to leisure activities [see the discussion of the potential impact of socioeconomic status (SES)]. Clearly, further studies of the allele frequencies of DRD4 throughout the lifespan, rather than just at the extremes (Fig. 1) are warranted.

Forgeneticstudiesofcomplexphenotypes,mostassociatedvariants observed to have relatively small effect sizes ((cid:7) 1%), as expected for populations similar to the oldest-old population studied here 25%;Herskind al., 1996; Mitchell et al., 2001). Given the estimated effect size for the 7R/longevity association ((cid:3)2 whens 0.026; Fig. 2), we can estimate ndt~l 10.2% of the variance attributable to genes, measured in herita- 0.03–0.04;Fig.4).Thesevaluesarequite for a phenotype expected to be associated with many genes, and that variants of DRD4 make a significant impact on longevity,

In conclusion, we observed a striking increase in DRD4 7R allele frequency in the oldest-old population and a strong associ- ationofthisallelewithincreasedactivitylevels.Thesefindingsare consistent with our animal model results showing that the DRD4 gene moderates the beneficial effects of an enriched environment in increasing the rodent’s lifespan. We propose that DRD4 gene vari- antsmoderatelongevitybyalteringbehavioralresponsestoenviron- mentalfactors.Itislikelythatsuchgene–environmentalinteractions underlie much human variability and many common disorders af- flicting humankind (Wang et al., 2006; Manolio et al., 2009).

A strength and a weakness of the current study is that the oldest- old population studied is of predominantly European ancestry. We specifically chose this population to reduce the genetic diversity and allow for better case-control matching, essential for genetic studies. Itshouldbecautioned,therefore,thatitisunclearhowbroadlysuch results can be inferred beyond the ancestry group examined. The ubiquitous presence of DRD4 7R (and its derived 2R allele) in most human populations (Ding et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004), however, make it likely that this study can be generalized (and potentially replicated) in individuals whose ancestry is from different geo- graphic origins. While a prospective design would allow for much stronger inferences, the logistics and cost of a prospective study to assess the effects of genotype on longevity are enormous, and data would not be available for analysis until the cohorts died.

The current study was conducted on a population with high educational achievement and socioeconomic status (SES), again, to minimize the effect of these variables on our genetic studies. SES is known to influence both longevity and research participa- tion (Seeman et al., 2004). While this homogeneity is an advan- tage,makingitlesslikelythatindividualswithdifferentgenotypes would be differentially recruited, replication studies in other SES populations should be pursed. Indeed, one could hypothesize that the “enriched environment” found in the currently investi- O+ | gated 90 population (Paganini-Hill et al., 2011) would not be available to individuals with lower SES, and hence DRD4 7R fre- quency might not be elevated in such populations.

Finally, it would be useful to obtain measures of physical activity and DRD4 genotype in younger populations. DRD4 variation is not
