Genotype predicts longevity in mice and humans. Deborah L. Grady, Panayotis K. Thanos, Maria M. Corrada, Jeffrey C. Barnett Jr., Valentina Ciobanu, Diana Shustarovich, Anthony Napoli, Alexandra G. Moyzis, David Grandy, Marcelo Rubinstein, Gene-Jack Claudia H. Kawas, Chuansheng Chen, Qi Dong, Eric Wang, Nora D. Volkow and Robert K. Moyzis conducted research to investigate the impact of genetic factors on longevity. The dopamine system in the brain is a crucial factor that affects traits like sensitivity to reward, incentive motivation and sustained effort which influence behavioral responses to the environment. The dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) moderates the effects of the environment on behavior and health and may be involved in longevity. The hypothesis that DRD4 gene variants contribute to longevity was tested by comparing surviving participants of a 30-year-old population-based health survey (N 310; age range 90-109 years; the 90 Study) with a younger population of European ancestry (N 2902; age range 7-45 years). The oldest-old population had a 66% increase in individuals carrying the DRD4 7R allele compared to the younger sample (p <3.5x10^-9), and this genotype was strongly associated with increased levels of physical activity. DRD4 knock-out mice exhibited a 79.7% decrease in lifespan, reduced spontaneous locomotor activity and no lifespan increase when reared in an enriched environment compared with wild-type and heterozygous mice. These results suggest that DRD4 gene variants contribute to longevity in humans and mice and that this effect is mediated by shaping behavioral responses to the environment.

The study also revealed that genetic factors contribute to both longevity and health among the oldest-old population. Although lifestyle choices like smoking and early death from pulmonary disease or cancer have a significant impact on longevity, little attention has been directed towards genes that influence personality as longevity genes. Individuals aged 90 years and above represent the fastest-growing segment of the population, yet little is known about the factors that contribute to their extreme longevity. Investigating these factors would help develop strategies to increase the number of people who reach old age in good health.

The human dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene is an excellent example of a gene that influences personality traits like novelty-seeking and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The DRD4 gene exhibits an unusually high amount of expressed polymorphism due to a 48 bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) located in exon 3 that encodes the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Alleles containing from 2 to 11 repeats (2R to 11R) have been identified, with the three most common variants (2R, 4R, and 7R) accounting for more than 90% of the allelic diversity. The functional significance of these length/sequence changes in the DRD4 protein, in a region that couples to G-proteins, has been studied extensively. The 7R variant shows a blunted response to dopamine when compared with the 4R variant and does not form heteromers with the short isoform of the presynaptic dopamine D2 receptor. The DRD4 protein is expressed in several brain regions, with high levels in the prefrontal cortex. DRD4 knock-out mice display better performance on complex motor tasks and reduced exploration of novel stimuli. ADHD individuals with a 7R allele have faster reaction times than non-7R individuals.

In conclusion, the study by Grady et al. supports the hypothesis that DRD4 gene variants contribute to longevity in humans and mice mediated by shaping behavioral responses to the environment. Investigating genetic factors that influence personality traits like novelty-seeking and ADHD could help develop smarter strategies to increase the number of people who reach old age in good health.Cell lines, DNA, genotyping, and resequencing were used to obtain genotypes from a subset of 310 subjects. The subjects consisted of 91 males and 219 females, representative of the entire cohort with respect to gender, education, BMI, exercise, drinking, or medical histories. Two hundred seventy participants had complete information available from the Leisure World Cohort Study. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established for all 310 participants using a modified protocol involving up to five months of cell culture. Detailed ancestry information was collected from the 90 study participants to confirm self-declared ancestry for matching to the European ancestry population-based control sample DRD4 genotypes. Controls ranged in age from 7 to 45 years (mostly adolescents and college students). Previously established methods were used to genotype and resequence the DRD4VNTR variant. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in other genes used as controls were genotyped by DNA sequencing. The Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Irvine approved all procedures.

Given that the DRD4 7R allele is associated with increased activity/novelty-seeking in children and young adults, we hypothesized that this allele would be associated with increased physical activity in the elderly. In addition, since physical activity is associated with increased lifespan and health, we hypothesized that the DRD4 7R allele would be over-represented in the oldest old.

Genotypes obtained for the 90 sample were as follows: 62R/2R, 27 2R/4R, 4 2R/7R, 4 3R/3R, 25 3R/4R, 7 3R/7R, 135 4R/4R, 1 4R/5R, 3 4R/6R, 82 4R/7R, 1 4R/11R, 1 5R/6R, 1 5R/7R, 1 6R/6R, 11 7R/7R, and 1 7R/8R. The genotypes of the control individuals were as follows: 60 2R/2R, 16 2R/3R, 345 2R/4R, 1 2R/5R, 58 2R/7R, 1 2R/8R, 4 3R/3R, 127 3R/4R, 17 3R/7R, 1715 4R/4R, 5 4R/5R, 1 4R/6R, 493 4R/7R, 1 4R/8R, and 1 non-7Rx. There were no significant deviations from the expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Observed allele frequencies for the oldest-old sample were as follows: 2R (0.07),3 R(0.06),4 R(0.66),5 R(0.005),6 R(0.009),7 R(0.189),and8 R(0.0016). Observed allele frequencies for the population and ancestry-matched controls were as follows:2 R(0.09),3 R(0.03),4 R(0.76),5 R(0.002),6 R(less than or equal to)0.001,and7 R(0.12). The DRD4 7Rx category contains individuals with at least one DRD47Rx allele (or derived allele such as the DRD45Rx, DRD46Rx, DRD48Rx, DRD49Rx, DRD410Rx, and DRD411Rx), and the non-DRD47Rx category contains the remaining individuals. A representative sample of 140 oldest-old individuals was resequenced at the DRD4 exon 3 polymorphism to determine the haplotype (273 alleles). The common 7R (1-2-6-5-2-5-4) haplotype or 7R derivatives were the predominant 7R sequences, with the fraction of common to rare haplotypes similar to that observed in prior population studies.

In the oldest-old, we also observed a significant association between the DRD4 7Rx genotype and higher reported activity levels in both males and females. This association was observed not only for measures obtained in 1981 but also when the measured variable was current self-reported activity. Oldest-old participants with the DRD4 7Rx genotype were twice as likely to report exercising two hours per day in 1981. The correlation of higher activity with DRD4 7Rx genotype was not confounded by age, gender, alcohol intakeIn the larger Leisure World cohort (Paganini-Hill et al., 2011), the proportion of the variance in physical activity explained by DRD4 7R in this oldest-old population was r2 approximately 0.023. 

Results:
To test our hypothesis, we determined DRD4 exon 3 VNTR genotypes/sequences for 310 90+ study individuals (the oldest-old; mean age, 95.2 years; age range, 90-109 years; 91 males) (Fig. 1). These individuals represent 1.4-2.9% of their initial birth cohort and, by definition, should have altered allele frequencies of genes that impact health and longevity. When compared with matched European ancestry controls of individuals aged 50-90 years younger (N=2902; age range, 74-75 years), the oldest-old had a 66% increase in observed 7R/x genotype (Fig. 2) (0.364 vs 0.219, χ2=33.28, p=3.5 x10^-9; χ2=0.026). This extremely small p value would be significant at a genome-wide level following Bonferroni correction. Comparing allele frequency rather than genotype, the frequency of the 7R allele is greater in the oldest-old population by 72% (0.205 vs 0.119, χ2=38.27, p<6.15 x10^-10). This increase was preferentially observed in females (0.393 vs 0.297 males, χ2=9.65, p=0.002), among whom the difference was significant at a genome-wide level (0.393 vs 0.219, χ2=34.66, p<1.7 x10^-9). In contrast, the difference in males, while significant, did not reach genome-wide level significance (0.297 vs 0.219, χ2=3.11, p=0.034) (Fig. 2).

To test the association of the DRD4 gene with longevity and responses to the environment directly, we compared the lifespans of mice that expressed DRD4 (HT and WT) versus those of KO mice (Rubinstein et al., 1997) that lacked the DRD4 gene, when reared in either a DE (standard laboratory cage) or EE (group cages with multiple options for physical activity and exploration) environment (Ullman-Cullere and Foltz, 1999; Quimby et al., 2010). DRD4 genotype significantly affected the lifespan (F=5.74, p=0.004, χ2=0.03; Fig. 4). DRD4 KO mice (N=68) had a 9.7% shorter lifespan (mean and SEs: 94.8 ± 2.08 weeks; 95% CI, 91-99) than HT mice (N=57; 104 ± 1.82 weeks; 95% CI, 100-108; p<0.05), and 7% shorter than WT mice (N=117; 101.4 ± 2.38 weeks; 95% CI, 97-106; p<0.05). The rearing environment also influenced longevity (F=10.58, p=0.001, χ2=0.03; Fig. 4). Mice in EE (N=111; 102.2 ±1 .76 weeks; 95% CI,98-106) lived5.7% longer than mice in DE (N=131; 96.7 ± 1.54 weeks; 95% CI, 94-100; p<0.05), but these effects were moderated by the DRD4 genotype, as shown by a significant environment-by-genotype interaction (F=8.05, p<0.001, χ2=0.04; Fig. 4). Specifically, whereas the lifespan was increased in an EE for HT (9% increase) and WT (16% increase) mice, the longevity of DRD4 KO mice did not differ between DE and EE rearing conditions (p=0.15; Fig. 4, inset).

The mechanism by which the DRD4 variants would differentially influence environmental responses is unclear. The variant DRD4 7R protein has a blunted response for cAMP reduction compared with the 4R protein (Asghari et al., 1995; Jovanovic et al., 1999; Swanson et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2004). Also, the DRD4 7R protein, unlike theSignificantly greater (Zuk et al., 2012). Clearly, further studies of DRD4 7R contributions to the variance of activity level in other populations should be pursued. Unfortunately, there are no genetic markers on commercially available genotyping arrays that are in strong LD with the DRD4 7R VNTR (Saccone et al., 2009), making direct genotyping/sequencing essential. In further discussing our findings, it is important to note their limitations. The ideal control for the genotype/haplotype frequencies of DRD4 alleles would have been the non-living birth cohorts of our oldest-old population, which is clearly not possible. However, human gene frequencies cannot change radically in a few generations, except following extreme population bottlenecks, which have not occurred in the last 100 years in European ancestry populations. A possible selective force that could have introduced intergenerational variation is the high mortality due to infectious disease experienced early in life by this oldest-old cohort, which has been largely eliminated through the use of immunization and antibiotics in the younger cohort (Fig. 1). Thus, any hypothetical resistance allele might exhibit higher frequencies in the oldest-old population than currently observed due to this environmental intervention. However, it is unlikely that the DRD4 gene (or any of the three closest genes in modest LD with it: DEAF1, SCT, and MUPCDH) (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004) would confer such resistance. Moreover, allele frequencies at 20 randomly chosen polymorphisms in nine unrelated genomic regions (CFTR, ERCC8, ERBB4, FANCC, HTERT, NRF1, RTN1, SLC6A3, and UCP3) did not differ significantly among the oldest-old individuals, younger control individuals or HapMap European ancestry populations (International HapMap Consortium et al., 2007). Nor was the observed DRD4 7R male/female allele frequency bias (Fig. 2) found at any of these randomly chosen sites. It is difficult to conceive of a mechanism that explains the variations in allele frequencies between males and females except for one that involves the functional significance of the underlying variant locus. We cannot, however, rule out alternative behavioral possibilities to explain why 7R/x individuals are disproportionately found in our specific cohort, such as the ability/desire to live in a planned retirement community with good access to leisure activities [see the discussion of the potential impact of socioeconomic status (SES)]. Clearly, further studies of the allele frequencies of DRD4 throughout the lifespan, rather than just at the extremes (Fig. 1), are warranted. For genetic studies of complex phenotypes, most associated variants observed to have relatively small effect sizes (<1%), as expected for populations similar to the oldest-old population studied here (25%; Herskind et al., 1996; Mitchell et al., 2001). Given the estimated effect size for the 7R/longevity association (<2 when s = 0.026; Fig. 2), we can estimate ndt ~ 10.2% of the variance attributable to genes, measured in herita- 0.030-0.04; Fig. 4). These values are quite high for a phenotype expected to be associated with many genes and that variants of DRD4 make a significant impact on longevity.

In conclusion, we observed a striking increase in DRD4 7R allele frequency in the oldest-old population and a strong association of this allele with increased activity levels. These findings are consistent with our animal model results showing that the DRD4 gene moderates the beneficial effects of an enriched environment in increasing rodents' lifespan. We propose that DRD4 gene variants moderate longevity by altering behavioral responses to environmental factors. It is likely that such gene-environmental interactions underlie much human variability and many common disorders afflicting humankind (Wang et al., 2006; Manolio et al., 2009).

A strength and a weakness of the current study are that the oldest-old population studied is of predominantly European ancestry. We specifically chose this population to reduce the genetic diversity and allow for better case-control matching, essential for genetic studies. It should be cautioned, therefore, that it is unclear how broadly such results can be inferred beyond the ancestry group examined. The ubiquitous presence of DRD4 7R (and its derived 2R allele) in most human populations (Ding et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004), however, makes it likely that this study can be generalized (and potentially replicated) in individuals whose ancestry is from different geographic origins. While a prospective design would allow for much stronger inferences, the logistics and cost of a prospective study to assess the effects of genotype on longevity are enormous, and data would not be available for analysis until the cohorts died.
