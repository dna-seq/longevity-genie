Abstract Gene polymorphisms associated with the plasma levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)—hemostasis proteins that help to predict the risk of atherothrombotic disease—were compared in 124 healthy individuals > 100 years old and 130 young, healthy indi viduals to identify genetic influences on extreme longevity. We investigated the restriction fragment length polymorphism G/A"455 located in the promoter of the p-fibrinogen gene, the guanine insertion/deletion polymorphism 4G/5G in the pro moter of the PAI-1 gene, and the R353Q substitution polymor phism in exon 8 of the factor VII gene. Alleles and genotypes associated with elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen and factor VII were found with similar frequencies in centenarians and in

the comparison group. However, in centenarians there was a sig nificantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozy gous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis, is com patible with successful aging. (Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol. 1997;17:755-759.)

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the allele and genotype frequencies of polymorphisms influencing plasma levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and PAI-1 in a cohort of Italian healthy centenarians, who are considered a natural model of extreme longevity and positive selection.7 Results obtained in these exceptional individuals, who have escaped age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of life, were compared with those obtained in healthy individuals who were young enough that none of them would be lost from the study sample because of symptomatic atherothrombotic disease. We surmised that the study of genetic markers of hypercoagulability and hypofibrinoly- sis should establish whether or not successful aging is asso ciated with the predominance of genotypes predicting lower plasma levels of hemostasis proteins.

Common biallelic polymorphisms of the genes encod ing for fibrinogen, factor VII, and PAI-1 influence the plasma levels of these proteins.2 The polymorphic genotypes asso ciated with elevated plasma levels of these hemostasis com ponents might prove more reliable as predictors of the throm botic risk than the plasma levels. In the general population, plasma levels have a continuous distribution, and so it is difficult to establish cutoff values that can identify the indi viduals at risk. In addition, variation of plasma levels deter mined by environmental factors may further complicate risk assignment. To assess the value of genetic markers as risk predictors, studies have been carried out in relatively small groups of individuals with or without atherothrombotic dis ease, but the results have been conflicting. 3"6

Methods

Subjects

In Italy, there is currently a multicenter project on centenarians; it is coordinated by one of the authors (C.F.). The aim of thi sproj ect is to study the mechanisms of successful aging. Centenarians identified from the General Registry Offices are studied in special units, generally established in university departments. Approxi mately 2000 centenarians have been identified.7 Several biological systems of these individuals are being investigated by biochemical and molecular methods.

Study Design

The present study is part of the hemostasis DNA polymorphisms for two coagulation factors, factor VI1 and fibrinogen, and the fibrinolysis inhibitor PAI-1 were studied in 124 healthy centenarians from four metropolitan communities in north ern Italy (Milan, Modena, Parma, and Genoa). Allele and genotype frequencies were compared with those of 130 young, healthy

viduals recruited from the same communities and ethnically homo geneous with the centenarians but unrelated to them. Approval these studies was obtained from the Institutional Review Board the University of Milan, and informed consent was given after experimental nature of the studies had been explained.

The method used was that described by Green et al.3 Genomic DNA was analyzed. Oligonucleotide primers were those described by Humphries et al.13 Amplification involved 36 cycles of 93°C (60 seconds), 55°C (60 seconds), and 72°C (120 seconds). Subsequently, the PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme Msp I (Boehringer Mannheim), and the digestion products were separated by electrophoresis on ethid ium bromide-stained 3% agarose gel. The fragment of the 353R allele was 205 bp and that of the 353Q allele, 272 bp.

Centenarians (96 women and 28 men 100 to 109 years old, white) were ambulatory, self-sufficient, and living in their homes. None of them were current smokers; 31 had stopped smoking between 5 and 10 years before blood sampling, whereas the remaining 93 had never smoked or had stopped smoking at least 10 years before. They were selected from the whole group of centenarians identified in the same communities because they were judged to be healthy on the basis of the Senieur protocol1,0 which establishes strict enrollment criteria based on clinical his tory, physical examination, and laboratory data for studies on healthy elderly people. Exclusion criteria were chronic disorders such as dementia, malignancy, infection, diabetes, a history of arterial and venous thrombosis, and current or past cardiovascu lar, renal, and liver disease. Hemocytometry and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and plasma concentrations of glucose, sodium, potassium, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aminotrans ferases, urea, and creatinine were measured. Centenarians with values outside the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the reference val ues of these measurements were excluded. An electrocardiogram was also obtained. Values of serum triglycerides, a measurement not included in the Senieur protocol, were available in only 101 centenarians and in 60 control subjects.

PAI-1 Polymorphism

The guanine insertion/deletion polymorphism is located at position -675 in the promoter region of PAI-1, where one allele has a sequence of four guanines (4G) and the other has a fifth guanine inserted (5G).14 The polymorphism is associated with plasma PAI-1 levels.614 Individuals homozygous for the 4G allele (frequency =0.50) have 25% to 30% higher PAI-1 levels than individuals with at least one 5G allele.

oligonucleotide melting technique described by Dawson et al,14 with some modifications. An 890-bp region of the PAI-1 pro moter was amplified by PCR using the primers described Dawson.14 Amplification involved 35 cycles of 95°C (60 sec onds), 55°C (60 seconds), and 72°C (60 seconds). Samples (3 5 uL) of each PCR product were spotted onto two sheets Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham). Samples were dena tured in 1.5 mol/L NaOH, 0.5 mol/L NaCl for 5 minutes, neu tralized with 3x SSC, and fixed with ultraviolet cross-linking. Two 14-mer oligonucleotides were designed to cover the poly morphic site of each allele: 5'-CACGTGGGGAGTCA-3' and 5'-ACGTGGGGGAGTCA-3'. T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) was used to phosphorylate the 5' ends with [32P]ATP. Membranes were prehybridized individually by immersion for at least 2 hours in a solution containing 5x SSPE buffer, Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrroli done, 0.1% BSA), 100 ng/mL salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5% SDS. Then the labeled probes were added separately to each solution at a final concentration of 105 cpm/mL for at least 1 hour. Membranes were washed in 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS for minutes to remove background hybridization. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were carried out at 55°C for oligonucleotide complementary to the 4G allele and at 58°C the oligonucleotide complementary to the 5G allele. Autoradio- grams were obtained by exposing films to membranes intensifying screens for 16 to 20 hours at -70°C. Samples individuals with known genotypes determined by allele-specific oligonucleotide melting14 and kindly supplied by S. (London, UK) were used as controls.

Young individuals (82 women and 48 men) were all <31 years old (mean age, 25.3±3.7 years; range, 14 to 30 years) and were randomly selected from the same metropolitan communi ties (hospital staff, high-school students). Arterial or venous thrombotic disease was excluded on the basis of clinical history and the results of physical examination. None of them were cur rent or recent smokers.

Blood samples for DNA analysis were drawn directly into vacuum containers containing sodium citrate as anticoagulant. Genomic DNA was prepared from whole blood by a salting-out procedure."

Fibrinogen Polymorphism

The biallelic polymorphism is located in the pro moter region of the (3-fibrinogen gene. The allele containing polymorphic cutting site for the restriction enzyme Haelll identified as G-455, and the allele without the cutting site is iden tified as A-455. Carriers of the less frequent allele A"455 (=0.20 in the general population) have higher fibrinogen levels (=20% 30%) than carriers of the G~455 allele.12

The method used was that described by Thomas et with some modifications. Briefly, a portion of the (3-fibrinogen gene, -551 to -109 bp from the start of transcription, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5'-ATA- GAATAGGGTATGAATTTG-3' and 5'-GAACCATTTTAT- CATTTAAGC-3' in a 50-uL mixture containing 200 to 500 ng DNA, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 200 umol/L of each nucleotide triphos phate, 100 pmol of each primer, 2 mmol/L MgCh, 10 Tris, 50 mmol/L KC1 (pH 8.3), and 2.5 U Taq Amplification involved 33 cycles of 93CC (20 seconds), 50°C (10 seconds), and 70°C (45 seconds). Subsequently, the PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme Haelll (Boehringer Mannheim). Finally, the digestion products were separated by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel and stained ethidium bromide. The fragments of the G"455 allele contained 346 and 96 bp and the fragment of the A"455 allele, 442 bp.

Statistical Analysis

The allele and genotype frequencies of the two study groups were compared by %2 analysis by a method designed for small even zero populations.15 The odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to measure the association between each genotype and being a centenarian. The data were adjusted for sex by multiple logistic regression analysis. The association between triglycerides and genotypes was evaluated by ANOVA. For circumstantial technical reasons, not all the results could be obtained for all the samples, so that in some instances the num bers of centenarians and control subjects studied are <124 and <130, respectively (see Tables).

Results

Table 1 shows that for the fibrinogen and factor VII poly morphisms, there was no significant difference between cen tenarians and control subjects in the allele frequencies or in the frequencies of the six possible genotypes. However, there was a difference for the PAI-1 polymorphism: the 4G allele and the homozygous 4G4G genotype, associated with elevated plasma levels of the fibrinolysis inhibitor, were significantly

Factor VII Polymorphism

The biallelic polymorphism is located in exon 8 of the VII gene and results from a missense mutation, leading to substitution of 353R by Q in the mature protein.3 Factor VII plasma levels are 20% to 25% higher in 353RR homozygotes than in carriers of the 353Q allele, which has a population fre quency of =0.10.3

•Adjusted for sex by multiple logistic regression.

Discussion

more frequent in centenarians than in young individuals (P=.021 and />=.049, respectively) (Table 1). The odds ratios, which give a measure of the relative chance of subjects with or without a given allele or genotype becoming centenarians, were 1.5 and 2.6 for the 4G allele and 4G4G genotype, respec tively (Table 1). Our population of centenarians was composed mainly of women, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:3. There was no significant sex-related difference in any of the allele or genotype frequencies (data not shown).

Three gene polymorphisms associated with the plasma levels of coagulation and fibrinolysis proteins that help predict atherothrombotic disease have been evaluated in exceptionally long-lived individuals. We investigated poly morphisms of the coagulation factors, fibrinogen and fac tor VII, shown by the prospective Northwick Park Heart to be independent predictors of ischemic heart disease in mid dle-aged individuals.1 Also, because a prospective cohort investigation has shown that high levels of plasma activity are associated with early recurrence of myocardial infarction in young men,16 we investigated a PAI-1 poly morphism. Only a limited amount of blood can be from such elderly persons, and so the simultaneous mea surement of the corresponding plasma proteins was not

In centenarians and control subjects, we also analyzed the distribution of the 27 combinations of the nine possi ble genotypes for fibrinogen, factor VII, and PAI-1 poly morphisms. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the frequency of any combination 2). Some combinations were present only in a small num ber of cases; six combinations were absent in both cente narians and young individuals (Table 2).

homozygous genotypes (AA"455 and 353RR) associated with higher levels of fibrinogen and factor VII were similar centenarians and young individuals. These alleles and geno types are associated not only with high plasma levels of these proteins but also with larger increments when car riers are exposed to environmental triggers such as smok ing (for fibrinogen) and hypertriglyceridemia (for factor VII and PAI-1).2'7 The effect of smoking could not be evaluated in this study because centenarians were non- smokers or had stopped smoking for a period of time enough that any effect of smoking would be offset. In cen tenarians, triglyceride levels were higher than in young indi viduals and were associated with 4G4G genotype of the PAI-1 polymorphism, whereas there was no significant

The effect of smoking on the distribution of the genotypes of the fibrinogen polymorphism was not because centenarians (and control subjects) were or had stopped smoking for >5 years. Mean levels of serum triglycerides were significantly higher in cente narians (n=101) than in young individuals (n=60) versus 74±28 mg/dL, P<.001). In neither group was any significant difference (ANOVA) in triglyceride in relation to the different genotypes of the factor VII poly morphism (Table 3). Mean triglyceride values were in centenarians homozygous for the 4G PAI-1 polymorphism than in those with the 5G5G genotype (P<.05), but this dif ference was not seen in young individuals.

The results of this study in centenarians on the of gene polymorphisms associated with cardiovascular risk factors are compatible with the belief that the basis of suc cessful aging is complex and multifactorial. It is likely that unidentified factors compensate for potentially unfavorable genotypes in centenarians. For instance, it can be hypoth esized that the association of 4G with longevity arises because linkage disequilibrium with a locus counteracting the putative unfavorable effect of elevated PAI-1 levels off sets the risk conferred by hypofibrinolysis and creates favor able long-term effects. We should also consider the pos sibility of a cohort effect when comparing centenarians with individuals <30 years old, because young individuals may not have been exposed to the same environmental factors to which centenarians had been exposed at the ages. It is also possible that among elderly people who escaped atherothrombotic disease, it is actually to have reduced fibrinolytic activity. The general conclu sion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no evi dence that possession of genotypes associated with circulating levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and PAI-1 reduces the chance of survival to the age of 100 years without evi dent atherothrombotic disease.

ciation between triglycerides and the factor VII genotype 353RR. Hence, the interaction between triglycerides and PAI-1 genotypes found in patients with non-insulin depen dent diabetes mellitus17 was also present in centenarians. The relatively small sample is perhaps an explanation for the lack of association between triglyceride levels and the 4G4G genotype in young, healthy individuals.

On the whole, our findings in centenarians indicate that during the process of selection that allows a few individuals to reach the extreme limits of human life, one is not dis advantaged by the polymorphic genotypes associated with high levels of coagulation factors and high responses to environmental triggers. The 4G allele and 4G4G genotype associated with elevated levels of PAI-1, which predict recurrence of myocardial infarction in young men, were even more frequent in centenarians than in young indi viduals. It is intriguing that genotypes associated with "high-risk" phenotypes are at least as frequent or even more frequent in centenarians than in young individuals who carry a lifelong risk of atherothrombotic disease. This para doxical finding is not isolated, because other genotypes with potentially unfavorable cardiovascular effects have been found more frequently in centenarians. Schachter et al,18 for instance, found that the homozygous genotype for the deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which predisposes to coronary heart disease,19,20 is more frequent in French centenarians than in adults 20 to 70 years old (39.6% versus 25.6%). On the other hand, the e4 allele of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E, which has been associated with ischemic heart disease,21'22 was
