Objective—Transthyretin can cause amyloidosis attributable to destabilization of transthyretin tetramers in plasma. We tested the hypothesis that genetic stabilization of transthyretin associates with reduced risk of vascular disease and increased

Approach and Results—We included 68 602 participants from 2 prospective studies of the general population. We genotyped for 2 stabilizing genetic variants in the transthyretin gene (TTR), R104H and T119M, and determined the association of genotypes with plasma levels of transthyretin, measures of thyroid function, risk of vascular disease, and life expectancy. During a mean follow-up of 32 years, 10 636 participants developed vascular disease. We identified 321 heterozygotes for T119M (frequency, 0.47%); R104H was not detected. First, mean plasma transthyretin and thyroxine levels were increased by 17% (26 µg/mL) and 20% (19 nmol/L), respectively, in heterozygotes versus noncarriers (P=0.007 and P<0.0001), demonstrating functionality of this variant in the general population. Second, corresponding hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.97) for all vascular diseases, 0.85 (0.59–1.23) for cardiovascular disease, 0.45 (0.25–0.81) for cerebrovascular disease, 0.47 (0.25–0.88) for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and 0.31 (0.04–2.22) for hemorrhagic stroke. The cumulative incidence of cerebrovascular disease as a function of age was decreased in heterozygotes versus noncarriers (P=0.005). Third, median age at death from all causes, from vascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and after diagnosis of vascular disease, and median age at diagnosis of vascular disease, was increased by 5 to 10 years in heterozygotes versus noncarriers (P=0.002–0.05).

Conclusions—These results are compatible with an association between genetic stabilization of transthyretin and decreased risk of cerebrovascular disease, and with increased life expectancy in the general population. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2013;33:1441-1447.)

wild-type transthyretin in many organs and in the walls of small arteries,6–8 but with clinical manifestations mainly from the heart attributable to restrictive cardiomyopathy.6,9–11 The hereditary forms of transthyretin amyloidosis are presumably rare and caused by mutations in the transthyretin gene (TTR) that make the tetrameric protein more unstable and prone to misfold into fibrils. The hereditary forms of transthyretin amyloidosis are typically of earlier onset and more severe than in senile systemic amyloidosis.12 Clinically, these patients may present with polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy characterized by deposition of amyloid in cerebral blood vessels, and clinically by both hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions.12,13 Hence, both senile systemic amyloidosis and hereditary forms may have deposition of amyloid in small arteries.

degenerative disease amyloidosis, a term for a group of dis- eases characterized by extracellular deposition of pathological insoluble fibrillar proteins in organs and tissues.1 Transthyretin is primarily synthesized in the liver, but is also produced in the choroid plexus.1–3 Although the main function is to transport retinol-binding protein, transthyretin also transports ≈15% and 80% of thyroxine in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively.3 In both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, transthyretin circulates as a tetramer comprising 4 identical subunits. Destabilization of these tetramers leads to monomer misfolding and amyloido- genesis, a process that can be prevented by ligands, such as thyroxine, and by drugs that stabilize transthyretin tetramers.4,5 In humans, both wild-type transthyretin tetramers and

tetramers comprising mutant and wild-type subunits can cause amyloidosis.4 Senile systemic amyloidosis is a common

Although most mutations in TTR increase the amyloidogenic potential of the protein by destabilizing the tetramers, 2 vari- ants, R104H (rs121918095) and T119M (rs28933981), have been shown to stabilize both wild-type transthyretin tetramers and tetramers comprising mutant and wild-type subunits, and thereby to prevent amyloidogenesis in vitro.14–17 These 2 muta- tions were first identified in compound heterozygotes, carrying one of these variants together with a known disease-causing mutation in Portuguese (T119M) and Japanese (R104H) fami- lies, respectively, and were reported to have milder disease than heterozygotes for the disease-causing mutation alone.14,18 Finally, some family studies have suggested increased thyrox- ine binding or increased levels of thyroxine or transthyretin in carriers of these 2 stabilizing variants.14,18–21

Genotype distribution did not deviate from the Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium (P=0.54). R104H, a stabilizing genetic variant previously identified in Asians,18,22 was not detected. Neither risk factors for ischemic vascular disease (Table) nor measures of glucose metabolism, renal function, liver function, or inflammation (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement) differed by T119M genotype, confirming that the effect of genotype on risk of vascular disease was not confounded by risk factors for vascular disease, or other markers of disease, including inflammatory disease. Comparing continuous traits as a function of genotype using parametric t tests did not mark- edly change these results (P values, 0.62–0.86 for Table and 0.05–0.99 for Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).

Whether any of these variants are common in the general population, whether they associate with increased thyroxine and transthyretin levels as markers of increased transthyretin tetramer stabilization, and whether they associate with reduced risk of vascular disease and increased life expectancy in the general population is currently unknown. We tested these hypotheses by genotyping for R104H and T119M in 2 simi- lar studies of the Danish general population, the Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study, totalling 68 602 participants, of which 10 636 partici- pants developed vascular disease.

TTR T119M Genotype and Plasma Transthyretin

Plasma levels of transthyretin were measured in a total of 1650 participants in the Copenhagen City Heart Study: in all heterozygotes with plasma available (n=35) and in a random sample of noncarriers (n=1615). As previously reported,23 plasma transthyretin levels decreased as a function of age (in 10-year age groups) in both women and men (mean decrease in women and men, respectively, 50 μg/mL and 47 μg/mL; P values for trend <0.0001 from 20 to 80+ years). Mean plasma levels of transthyretin were 16 µg/mL lower in women than in men (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement; P<0.0001). Results were similar when using parametric tests (P values <0.0001 by linear regression analysis).

Materials and Methods

T119M heterozygotes had a 17% (26 μg/mL) increase in plasma levels of transthyretin compared with noncarriers. Mean transthyretin levels were 183 μg/mL and 157 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 1A; P=0.007). When matching 1:7 by age (in 10-year age groups) and by sex to account for the effect of age and sex on transthyretin levels (Figure I in the online- only Data Supplement), the corresponding increase was 20% (31 μg/mL; Figure 1B; P=0.003). Results were similar

TTR T119M Genotype, Plasma Thyroxine and Other Measures of Thyroid Function

The cumulative incidence of cerebrovascular disease was reduced in T119M heterozygotes versus noncarriers (Figure 4; log rank, P=0.005). At the age of 75 years, the cumulative incidence of cerebrovascular disease was 5% in T119M het- erozygotes and 12% in noncarriers (Figure 4).

TTR T119M genotype associated with a 20% (19 nmol/L) increase in mean plasma levels of total thyroxine in heterozy- gotes versus noncarriers. Mean total thyroxine levels were 114 nmol/L and 95 nmol/L, respectively (Figure 2; P<0.0001). In contrast, genotype did not associate with other measures of thyroid function, that is, thyroid stimulating hormone, triiod- thyronine or triiodthyronine uptake test, an indirect measure , of the amount of thyroxine bound to thyroid-binding globu- lin, (Figure 2; P=0.56–0.63), or with plasma levels of albu- min (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement; P=0.89). In plasma, thyroid-binding globulin normally binds 70% to 80% of thyroxine, transthyretin binds 10% to 15%, and the rest is bound to albumin.3,24 Hence, these data suggest that T119M heterozygotes have increased total thyroxine levels attribut- able to an increased binding of thyroxine to transthyretin, but normal thyroid function. Results were similar after adjusting for age and sex by linear regression analysis (β-coefficient=18, corresponding to a mean increase in thyroxine of 18 nmol/L in heterozygotes versus noncarriers, P<0.0001; remaining

TTR T119M Genotype and Life Expectancy

In T119M heterozygotes versus noncarriers, median age at death was increased for all causes of death by 5 years (P=0.04), for death from vascular disease by 7 years (P=0.01), and for death from cerebrovascular disease by 10 years (P=0.03); age at death from nonvascular disease did not differ by genotype (P=0.61; Figure 5, left and middle). Furthermore, median age at death after diagnosis of vascular disease was increased by 7 years in heterozygotes versus noncarriers (P=0.002; Figure 5, right). Finally, median age at diagnosis of all vascular diseases and cardiovascular disease was increased by 7 and 8 years, respectively (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement; P=0.05 and P=0.02), while the data suggested a similar trend for median age at diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease (P=0.59). Results were similar, but slightly attenuated, after adjusting for sex by linear regression analysis (P values for age at death, 0.01– 0.62; P values for age at disease, 0.06–0.75; data not shown).

Discussion

During a mean follow-up of 32 years (range, 0–34 years), the multifactorially adjusted (adjusted for age, sex, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, physical activity, lipid-lowering therapy, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen) hazard ratios for T119M heterozygotes versus noncarriers were 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.97; P=0.03) for all vascular disease, 0.85 (0.59–1.23; P=0.39) for cardiovascular disease, 0.45 (0.25–0.81; P=0.008) for cerebrovascular disease, 0.47 (0.25–0.88; P=0.02) for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and

Our results were obtained in 2 similar prospective studies of the general population comprising 68 602 participants, includ- ing 321 heterozygotes for TTR T119M and 10 636 individuals with incident vascular disease.

The principal findings of this study are the following: (1) One in 200 individuals (0.47%) in a white general population is heterozygous for TTR T119M, a variant known to stabilize transthyretin tetramers and to increase binding of thyroxine in vitro; (2) T119M is associated with increases in transthyretin and total thyroxine levels in heterozygotes versus noncarriers,

that carriers may have increased levels of transthyretin. In the largest study to date, we show that T119M heterozygotes have a 17% (26 μg/mL) increase in transthyretin levels compared with noncarriers. These findings are in contrast to the more unstable, pathogenic TTR-variants, where carriers typically display lower transthyretin levels than normal.12 Therefore, the higher transthyretin levels indicate a protein less likely to dissociate and aggregate into fibrils.

It has been shown both by extensive physicochemical stud- ies in vitro and by ex vivo studies of sera from T119M het- erozygotes14,19,20 that increased binding affinity for thyroxine reflects the stabilizing effect of T119M on the transthyretin tetramer. Furthermore, adding thyroxine, a natural ligand for transthyretin, has been shown to stabilize wild-type transthyre- tin and inhibit fibril formation in vitro.28 Therefore, increased plasma level of total thyroxine in heterozygotes is also a marker for the increased transthyretin tetramer stability attributable to T119M. We found that carriers had a 20% (19 nmol/L) increase in total thyroxine levels compared with noncarriers, but normal thyroid function, indicating that the increased thyroxine level was attributable to increased binding to transthyretin. Thus, our study demonstrates that T119M is functional and stabilizes transthyretin in the general population in vivo.

derived from normal wild-type transthyretin.6,9 Postmortem studies have shown that senile systemic amyloidosis affects ≈25% of individuals >80 years; however, the impact of this condition in the general population is not known.9,10 Although cardiomyopathy may be the most severe manifestation of senile systemic amyloidosis, this condition has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction in autopsy studies,9,10 and possibly an increased risk of cardioembolic stroke.29,30 Furthermore, vascular deposits of transthyretin amyloid have been found systemically in cases with senile systemic amyloidosis,7,8 indicating that the vascular integrity may be compromised in other organs as well, including the brain. Therefore, we propose that the protective effect on vascular disease associated with the stabilizing variant T119M may be attributable to a reduced deposition of wild-type transthyretin in the wall of small arteries. In addition, in the present study, heterozygotes had increased life expectancy overall and

studies, but may suggest that drugs, such as tafamidis,4,5,25 which kinetically stabilize transthyretin, may have similar beneficial effects in the general population.

The stabilizing effect of the T119M variant in vitro has been convincingly shown by subunit exchange, where an increasing number of T119M subunits in the tetrameric structure associated strongly with decreased fibril formation and increased tetramer stability.16,17 The stabilizing property of the T119M variant is suggested to explain why compound heterozygotes for T119M and disease-causing mutations in TTR are protected from disease.14,15 However, the frequency and impact of T119M in the general population has not been determined previously. Thus far, only a few studies with a limited number of carriers have examined the effect of heterozygosity for T119M on plasma levels on transthyretin20,21,26,27; most suggest

general population. Indirectly, these data, therefore, also sug- gest that amyloidosis as a cause of cerebrovascular disease may be relatively common in the general population. These results have potential clinical implications, because they sug- gest that current drugs, which inhibit the amyloid cascade by mimicking the stabilizing effect of T119M on the transthyre- tin tetramer,4,5,25 may slow the progression of vascular deposits leading to cerebrovascular disease in the general population.

among those who died from vascular and cerebrovascular disease, increased life expectancy after diagnosis of vascular disease and increased age at diagnosis of vascular disease compared with noncarriers. These results support that T119M may act through an effect on the vascular wall.

The sporadic form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy with deposition of Aβ, the protein also implicated in Alzheimer dis- ease, is a common condition affecting ≈40% to 50% of indi- viduals aged ≥60 years,13,31 and leading to an increased risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebral events. Several studies have shown that transthyretin can interact with Aβ and possibly inhibit Aβ amyloid deposition.32–34 Thus, another potential explanation for the apparent protective effect of T119M on cerebrovascular disease could be that T119M sta- bilizes transthyretin in the cerebrospinal fluid and, by binding Aβ, protects against sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

In conclusion, these results are compatible with an asso- ciation between genetic stabilization of transthyretin and decreased risk of cerebrovascular disease, but need to be con- firmed in other large studies.

Other studies have pointed to a general role for transthyretin in neurobiology and repair.3,35 More specifically, transthyre- tin has been suggested to be an important factor in response to brain ischemia; however, human evidence is lacking.36 Although the association with cerebrovascular disease in our study seems to be attributable mainly to a reduced risk of isch- emic cerebrovascular disease, firm conclusions regarding the effect on hemorrhagic stroke cannot be based on the relatively limited number of individuals with this endpoint.

Dietary factors, such as resveratrol (active component in red grapes/red wine), curcumin (major bioactive polyphenol of turmeric), and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (most abundant catechin in green tea), have been shown to be able to stabilize transthyretin and, perhaps even, inhibit transthyretin amyloid deposition in vitro and in animal studies.37–40 Positive results from human trials have also been reported.41 Therefore, one can speculate that the beneficial effects observed with high or moderately high dietary intake of these compounds may be partly through their stabilizing effect on transthyretin.

Iodinated transthyretin derivates are candidate drugs for transthyretin amyloidosis, showing improved stability as com- pared with transthyretin.42 Thyroxine binding stabilizes trans- thyretin through 4 iodine substituents, and there are additional binding sites for thyroxine left unbound on transthyretin. Hence, total plasma iodine levels may correlate with transthyretin lev- els and may, therefore, be higher in individuals with higher transthyretin levels, such as in T119M heterozygotes, because transthyretin binds more thyroxine and, therefore, more iodine.

Further limitations to our study include that we only exam- ined whites and, therefore, our findings may not translate to populations of other ethnicities. However, because T119M is present in both whites of European ancestry and in blacks of African American ancestry,43 the effect of T119M in humans is probably not ethnicity specific. Nevertheless, large studies of other ethnic groups are needed to address this issue. Finally, R104H, a genetic variant previously identified in Asians,18,22 was not detected in our study, but may have similar protective effects as T119M in Asian populations.

In the present study, we show that genetic stabilization of transthyretin attributable to heterozygosity for T119M pro- tects against cerebrovascular disease. Thus, our data could suggest that T119M protects against amyloid deposition in the

Significance

Transthyretin can cause amyloidosis attributable to destabilization of transthyretin tetramers in plasma. We tested the hypothesis that genetic stabilization of transthyretin associates with reduced risk of vascular disease and increased life expectancy. Our novel findings include the following: (1) One in 200 individuals (0.47%) is heterozygous for TTR T119M, a variant known to stabilize transthyretin tetramers; (2) T119M is associated with increases in transthyretin and total thyroxine levels in heterozygotes versus noncarriers, providing direct evidence for the stabilizing function of this variant in vivo; (3) T119M heterozygotes have reduced risk of vascular disease, mainly cerebrovascular disease; (4) T119M heterozygotes have increased life expectancy overall and after diagnosis of vascular disease. These results have potential clinical implications, because they suggest that current drugs, which inhibit the amyloid cascade by mimicking the stabilizing effect of T119M on transthyretin, may slow the progression of vascular deposits leading to cerebrovascular disease in the general population.
