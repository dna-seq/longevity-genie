the text, there is a misspelling of "Journal" as "Journa." Additionally, "American Heart Association" is misspelled as "AmericanHeartAssociatione." These should be corrected.

In the title of the article, "Aging and genetic variation of plasma apolipoproteins" should be capitalized appropriately.

There are a few instances where words have been split incorrectly across lines, such as "approximately" in the second paragraph and "apolipoproteins" in the third paragraph. These should be merged correctly.

There are also some unnecessary duplications of words or phrases, such as "of Plasma Apolipoproteins" in the second and third paragraphs. These should be removed.

In the third paragraph, there is a grammatical error in the phrase "only approxi- mately one third as high." The hyphen should be removed.

In the same paragraph, there is an incorrect preposition in the phrase "frequency of the apolipoprotein E e2 allele was almost twice as high." It should be "for" instead of "of."

In the fourth paragraph, there is an incorrect verb tense in the phrase "an increased risk of coronary artery disease." It should be "has been."

In the fifth paragraph, there is a missing word in the phrase "essential for the synthesis and secretion." It should be "is."

In the same paragraph, there is a missing hyphen in "low-density lipoprotein." It should be hyphenated.

Overall, these errors and issues should be corrected to produce more readable and coherent text. The processed text is:

Abstract

We determined the common polymorphism of apolipoprotein E (E2, E3, and E4), apolipoprotein B Xba I polymorphism, and apolipoprotein C-III Sst I polymorphism in almost all Finnish centenarians alive in 1991 (n=179/185). Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in different apolipoprotein genotypes were also measured. In comparison with younger Finnish populations studied previously, the frequency of the apolipoprotein E2 allele was almost twice as high (7.0% versus 4.1%; P<.05) and that of the E4 allele only approximately one third as high (8.4% versus 22.7%; P<.001) in the centenarians. Plasma cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels tended to be lowest in the group with the E2 allele (4.33 mmol/L and 1.41 mmol/L, respectively), intermediate in those with the E3 allele (4.57 mmol/L and 1.48 mmol/L, respectively), and highest in those with the E4 allele (4.82 mmol/L and 1.60 mmol/L, respectively). The frequencies of the apolipoprotein B X1 and X2 alleles (Xba I restriction site absent or present, respectively) among the centenarians and among the young Finns were not significantly different, whereas the apolipoprotein C-III S2 allele (Sst I restriction site present) occurred more often in the centenarians (frequency, 12.9%) than in the youngest reference population (frequency, 8.8%; P<.05). Centenarians with the apolipoprotein B X2X2 genotype and apolipoprotein E4 phenotype had a higher mean plasma cholesterol level than those with the X1X1 genotype and E2 phenotype (5.24 versus 3.43 mmol/L; P<.05). We conclude that genetic variation of apolipoproteins influences blood lipid levels up to very high ages and that the E4 allele may affect life expectancy adversely.

ApolIn the Finnish Centenarian study conducted in March 1991, all individuals born in 1891 or earlier and alive in December 1990 (n=271) were identified from the Finnish national population registry. By December 1991, one of us (J.L.) had visited all centenarians who were alive at the time of examination (n=185). Of these centenarians, four refused to participate in the study, and two were not willing to give a blood sample. Of the remaining 179, 25% lived at home, 44% in homes for the elderly, and 31% in hospitals. Among the living centenarians, 70% (6.3/100 000 population) resided in southern Finland, 20% (4.7/100 000 population) in central Finland, and 10% (3.3/100 000 population) in northern Finland.

The allele frequencies of apoB and apoC-III in centenarians were compared with those in 307 young Finns (age range, 9 to 21 years) and 179 adult Finns (age range, 20 to 66 years). The apoC-III Sst I alleles in the adult series were determined during the course of this study using the Southern blot technique. The adult reference subjects lived in Helsinki and its surroundings, whereas the young subjects were from both western and eastern parts of the country. In this adult reference group, the mean serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride values were 5.76, 3.76, 1.74, and 1.17 mmol/L respectively while in the young group they were 4.74, 2.89, 1.47, and 0.84 mmol/L respectively.

Each subject was studied early in the morning after an overnight fast. A venous blood sample was drawn into a tube containing EDTA. A portion of the EDTA-anticoagulated blood was frozen for subsequent preparation of leukocytic DNA in a low-speed transportable centrifuge to prepare plasma. Ice-cooled plasma samples were sent to Helsinki within 24 hours for further analyses. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Helsinki University Central Hospital.

The determination of plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were done using enzymatic methods (Boehringer Mannheim) with an AutoAnalyzer II apparatus (Technicon Instruments). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was determined after precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins by heparin/manganese chloride, followed by separation of HDL and HDL3 by the addition of dextran sulfate. LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula. The concentrations of apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoB were measured with commercial immunoassay kits (Orion Diagnostica).

Statistical analyses were carried out using the BMDP software package (BMDP Statistical Software Inc). Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in different apolipoprotein genotypes were compared by ANOVA (BMDP 7D). The statistical significance of gene allele and genotype differences were tested by cross-tabulation (BMDP 4F). Their confidence intervals were calculated with a computer program based on the method of Gardner and Altman.

The determination of ApoE phenotypes showed that the Finnish centenarians had relatively low plasma total (4.6 mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol (2.4 mmol/L) levels and high HDL cholesterol (1.5 mmol/L) levels (Table 1). No significant sex differences were found in the mean plasma lipid or apolipoprotein levels. The sex difference in the phospholipid levels, even though statistically significant, was similar to those in the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. For subsequent analysis of plasma lipoproteins in different genotypes, the data for both sexes were combined.

The ApoE phenotype distribution and allele frequencies in centenarians were compared with those in 615 adult Finns (age range, 20 to 55 years) and 1577 young Finns (age range, 3 to 18 years) described previously. In the former study, the participants were mainly from the vicinity of Helsinki, the capital of the country, but the latter study included volunteers from both western and eastern parts of the country. The frequency of the ApoE e2 allele was significantly higher, and that of the e4 allele was lower among centenarians than in younger Finnish populations.

The apoC-III 52 allele occurred among centenarians with a relatively high frequency (12.9%), which showed a difference bordering on significance (P<0.05) when compared with either of the younger reference cohorts. In contrast, thereData from Reference 18 (n=176; age group, 20-66 years) were used to determine ApoC-III alleles. ApoE alleles were determined using data from Reference 11 (n=1577; age group, 3-18 years). For ApoB and ApoC-III alleles, data from Reference 17 (n=307; age group, 9-21 years) were used. P<.05, P<.01, and P<.001 were compared with the centenarians.

LDL-C indicates low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; ApoE, apolipoprotein E; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; and ApoC-lll, apolipoprotein C-lll. Values are meanSD, expressed in millimoles per liter.
*DNA samples for ApoB and ApoC-lll genotyping were available from only 171 subjects.
P<.05 indicates statistical difference among three groups.

Differences in the geographic origin of the subjects may have influenced the data obtained in this study in various ways, such as differences in the age groups and selection criteria used for the reference groups, as well as differences in the distribution of apoE phenotypes across different regions of Finland. However, previous studies have shown that the distribution of the apoE phenotypes is relatively uniform across different regions of Finland. It was assumed that the subjects living in the Helsinki region as adult control subjects were representative of the whole Finnish population. 

Subjects with the ApoB X1X1 genotype and E2 phenotype had lower plasma cholesterol levels (3.43 mmol/L; P<.05) than those with other genotype/phenotype combinations, while subjects with other combinations had intermediate plasma cholesterol levels (Figure). The ApoB gene was not associated with significant variations in plasma cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the centenarians (Table 4). No significant association was found between the polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein genes examined and plasma phospholipid, apoA-I, apoA-II, or apoB concentrations (data not shown).

Discussion 

The most significant finding of this study was the significantly diminished prevalence of the ApoE e4 allele in centenarians compared to younger age groups. The percentage frequency of this allele (8.4%) was less than half that found inSubclasses are genetically determined. Am J Hum Genet.  ; 11:157-166.

When the alleles at both loci were taken into account, the association between a high serum cholesterol level and apoE e4 plus apoB X2 reached statistical significance (Figure). This result is similar to that observed in a younger sample of the Finnish population.45 Our data suggest that the cholesterol-elevating effects of the apoE e4 allele and apoB X2 allele are lifelong. A further point of interest concerning these centenarians was their relatively high total HDL cholesterol level. According to cross-sectional and follow-up studies, serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decrease in the oldest age group, but a corresponding decline is less evident for HDL cholesterol.46-47 The high levels of HDL in all our centenarians support the view that high HDL cholesterol is associated with longevity and that it may exert a protective influence against Aalto-Setala K, Viikari J, Akerblom H, Kuusela V, Kontula DNA polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein B and AI/CIII genes are associated with variations of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in childhood.
