Genomewide Association Analysis and Relationship to Cardiovascular Risk and Mortality in Older Adults

Objective
CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane glycoprotein expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages that also circulates as a soluble form (sCD14). Despite the well-recognized role of CD14 in inflammation, relatively little is known about the genetic determinants of sCD14 or the relationship of sCD14 to vascular- and aging-related phenotypes.

Methods and Results
We measured baseline levels of sCD14 in >5000 European-American and black adults aged 65 years and older from the Cardiovascular Health Study, who were well characterized at baseline for atherosclerotic risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease, and who have been followed for clinical cardiovascular disease and mortality outcomes up to 20 years. At baseline, sCD14 generally showed strong positive correlations with traditional cardio-metabolic risk factors and with subclinical measures of vascular disease such as carotid wall thickness and ankle-brachial index (independently of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors), and was also inversely correlated with body mass index. In genomewide association analyses of sCD14, we (1) confirmed the importance of the CD14 locus on chromosome 5q21 in European-American; (2) identified a novel African ancestry-specific allele of CD14 associated with lower sCD14 in blacks; and (3) identified a putative novel association in European-American of a nonsynonymous variant of PIGC, which encodes an enzyme required for the first step in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis. Finally, we show that, like other acute phase inflammatory biomarkers, sCD14 predicts incident cardiovascular disease, and strongly and independently predicts all-cause mortality in older adults.

CD14 and sCD14 are able to mediate LPS-activation of mCD14-negative cells such as endothelial and smooth muscle cells,11,12 events that are important for the development of atherosclerosis and its complications. At higher concentrations, LPS binding protein and sCD14 downregulate LPS-induced responses13 by transfer of LPS to lipoproteins for subsequent removal. CD14 is a membrane glycoprotein constitutively expressed on monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils.1 Cell surface or membrane (m)CD14 binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other microbial and nonmicrobial ligands in the presence of another accessory protein, LPS binding protein, resulting in activation of various toll-like receptors and downstream pro-inflammatory pathway signaling.2,3 CD14 also exists as a soluble form (sCD14).4 In addition to secretion from liver, sCD14 may be derived by enzymatic cleavage of GPI-anchored cell membrane-bound CD14.

The genetic and environmental determinants of sCD14 are largely unknown, though CD14 expression appears to be at least partially regulated at the genetic level in a cell-type specific manner. The human CD14 gene on chromosome 5q23-31 contains a common proximal promoter polymorphism encoding a cytosine to thymidine transition at bp 159 from the major transcription start site that has been associated with circulating sCD14 levels.14,15 A regulatory element located further upstream of the CD14 gene is critical for sCD14 expression in hepatocytes but not in monocytes.9 In response to inflammation and infection, IL-6 induces hepatic sCD14 expression; therefore sCD14 is regarded as an acute phase protein.10 Like acute phase proteins, sCD14 levels increase in the presence of acute and chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. Similar to other acute phase inflammatory biomarkers, sCD14 predicts incident cardiovascular disease and strongly and independently predicts all-cause mortality in older adults.

Assessment of Association Between CD14 Genotype and CVD in Women's Health Initiative
To assess the association between CD14 SNP genotype and CVD, we used data from a larger nested case-control sample of incident CHD and stroke from the Women's Health Initiative.20 The sample included 3042 myocardial infarction (MI) and 2222 stroke EA cases and 296 MI and 251 stroke black cases. There were 2943 EA and 295 black controls without CHD or stroke. Genotyping and quality control of CD14 SNPs were performed using the ITMAT/Broad/CARe (IBC) array at TGen (Phoenix, Arizona). Logistic regression models were adjusted for traditional risk factors (age, BMI, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholesterol) and principal components to control for population stratification.

Methods
CHS Cohort
The CHSAge, sex, and the first 10 eigenvectors derived from principal components analysis were analyzed. For blacks, sCD14 was analyzed using log-transformed values in the genetic association analyses to assess statistical significance. Means and standard errors were reported from the corresponding untransformed model for comparisons with EAs. Haplotype frequency estimation and association analyses were performed using the haplo.stats package for R. Estimation of sCD14 phenotypic variance explained by genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed using the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis method, as described in the online-only Data Supplement.

We performed Cox proportional hazards models to test for association between sCD14 (or other inflammation biomarkers) and risk of incident CVD events or mortality. sCD14 and other biomarkers were analyzed continuously to estimate the effects of a 1-SD difference in value, as well as categorically using quintiles. The first quintile represented the reference group. For the continuous analysis, IL-6 and CRP were log-transformed. Persons with adjudicated baseline prevalent disease relevant for each outcome were excluded before Figure.

Distribution of soluble CD14 according to ethnicity and sex is shown in the figure. Median and interquartile ranges are indicated by the band and box edges, respectively. The whiskers indicate upper limits.

The rank correlation coefficient between sCD14 and CRP, fibrinogen, and IL-6 were 0.22, 0.21, and 0.17, respectively (all P<0.001). In age-, race-, and sex-adjusted models, sCD14 was positively correlated with baseline smoking, diabetes mellitus, fasting glucose, hypertension, and negatively correlated with BMI (all P<0.001; Table 1). The differences in sCD14 by race and sex persisted after adjusting for CVD risk factors (Table 1). When adjusted for baseline CHD and CVD risk factors, sCD14 was strongly and independently associated with other inflammatory and acute phase proteins, including CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen, as well as with increased internal carotid artery wall thickness and decreased ABI (all P<0.001).

The estimate of sCD14 phenotypic variance explained by genomewide SNPs was 33.17% (P=0.03). In the genomewide association scan of 2952 EA and 528 blacks, 2 regions, 1q24 and 5q31, reached genomewide significance in EA (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement); the chromosome 5q31 peak was also genomewide significant in blacks (Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). Results for the lead (index) SNPs associated with sCD14 in each genomic region are summarized in Table 2. In EA, the strongest genomewide association signal was located on chromosome 5q31, centered around the CD14 structural gene.

To our knowledge, family-based estimates of sCD14 heritability have not been previously reported. Therefore, we estimated the amount of phenotypic variance of sCD14 explained by distant genetic relationships between individuals with the CHS EA population by applying the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis method using all genotyped autosomal SNPs.

In the EA genome-wide association study (GWAS), a second region on chromosome 1q24.3 achieved genomewide significance. The index SNP rs1063412 at 1q24.3 is a C/T polymorphism that encodes a Pro266Ser amino acid substitution within the second exon of PIGC (MAF=0.43). According to the HapMap, the C allele (Pro266) is the minor allele in European and Asian populations, but is the major allele in African populations. The C allele (MAF=0.43 in CHS EA) was associated with 488 ng/mL lower sCD14 (P=1.4x10^-8).

To further explore the CD14 gene variants associated with sCD14 in EA and blacks, we used denser CD14 genotype data from the IBC array, which contains 15 SNPs covering the CD14 coding, intronic, untranslated, and flanking regions. In EA, the most strongly associated SNP on the IBC array was rs5744455 (P=3.5x10^-26), located 50 bp upstream of the transcription start site. On the basis of 1000 Genomes Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEU) data, this SNP is in strong LD with the index GWAS SNP, rs5744441 (LD r2=1.0). After conditioning on rs5744455, probability values for 3 additional SNPs in the CD14 region were significant at the Bonferroni-adjusted threshold of POf cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio=1.13; 95% CI=1.05-1.22; P=0.001) and death because of non-cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio=1.11; 95% CI=1.04-1.18; P=0.001). Table II in the online-only Data Supplement shows the association of each inflammation biomarker with mortality in multivariable models, including all the inflammation biomarkers. In these models, sCD14 and IL-6 were each independently associated with mortality, whereas CRP and fibrinogen were not. When analyzed categorically, there was a graded, linear increase in mortality risk with each successive sCD14 quintile. Compared with the bottom quintile, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) for the second, third, fourth, and fifth quintile were 1.00 (0.87-1.14), 1.02 (0.89-1.16), 1.12 (0.98-1.27), and 1.27 (1.11-1.45), respectively. The hazard ratios comparing top with bottom quintiles for cardiovascular death and non-cardiovascular were 1.26 (95% CI 1.01-1.57; P=0.04) and 1.32 (95% CI 1.11-1.57; P=0.002), respectively.

In blacks, several other SNPs on the IBC array had more significant P values than the index SNP from the black GWAS rs778584. The lead SNP from the IBC analysis was rs5744451 (MAF=0.09), which was associated with 27936 ng/mL lower sCD14 (P=1.31x10^-14). Rs5744451 is located in the 5' flanking region of CD14. This SNP was not successfully imputed and hence not included in the GWAS analysis. After conditioning on rs5744451, 3 additional CD14 SNPs (rs5744455, rs2569191, and rs778584) had P<0.003. Haplotype analysis confirmed that rs5744451 tags a second CD14-lowering haplotype that is common among blacks but rare among EA (Table 3).

Relationship of sCD14 to Incident CVD and Mortality

Among the 5462 EA and black participants with measured sCD14 at the CHS baseline examination, there were incident MI, 1547 incident CHD, 945 incident strokes, 3820 deaths during the 20-year follow-up period. Of the deaths, 1519 were attributed to cardiovascular causes.

Among the sCD14-associated SNPs identified in our GWAS, there was no association with risk of mortality in either ethnicity of CHS (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). In CHS, the minor alleles of CD14 rs4914 and rs778584 were each nominally associated with 1.3- to 1.6-fold increased risk of stroke in black, whereas rs778584 was associated with decreased risk of CHD in EA (P=0.025). However, these results were not significant when corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. Nor was there significant evidence for association between CD14 genotype and risk of CHD or stroke in a second, large case-control sample from the Women's Health Initiative (Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement).

Within several putatively functional genomic elements indicative of chromatin accessibility, including an Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements Consortium (ENCODE) DNaseI hypersensitivity site, histone methylation and acylation enrichment sites, and hepatocyte-specific transcription factor binding elements for hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A)- and forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), as determined by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Seq, CD14 is one of >100 cell-surface proteins anchored to the plasma membrane via GPI. Assembly of GPI-linked proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and involves more than 30 different genes. The first step of the biosynthesis, the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol, is mediated by at least 3 genes (PIGA, phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) in hematopoietic stem cells cause paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which manifests as bone marrow failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombosis.

As a result of the GPI anchoring defect, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients do not express mCD14 on their monocytes, yet have normal plasma levels of sCD14. Notably, the Pro266Ser amino acidAssociation of higher sCD14 with a functional coding variant of PIGC suggests that defective GPI anchor synthesis may be a mechanism that results in increased release of intracellular CD14 into the circulation from myeloid cells. Although the association reached genome-wide significance in EA and is certainly biologically plausible, verification of the association between PIGC rs1063412 and sCD14 in an independent EA population is necessary to authenticate the finding. Several limitations of the current study should be noted. Replication in an independent sample of EA, and also studies including larger numbers of blacks, will be required to validate the PIGC association and to determine whether the finding is ethnicity-specific. The remaining phenotypic variability in sCD14 not ascribed to heritable factors or loci identified in our analyses suggests a contribution of combined effects of rare variants not tagged by current genotyping arrays, non-additive genetic factors, as well as environmental factors. Therefore, genotyping arrays of even greater density and targeted sequencing of the CD14 locus may ultimately be required to identify the full spectrum of trait-associated variants. Finally, further study of the inverse relationship of sCD14 with body mass, as well as generalization of these association findings to younger adults, is needed.

Germline mutations in GPI anchor genes have been identified in congenital autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by a diverse range of phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a common, inherited variant of a gene involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis associated with a complex trait. A recent GWAS identified a SNP located 70 kb downstream of PIGC associated with waist-hip ratio.30 However, there is no LD between the waist-hip ratio-associated rs1011731 variant and the sCD14-associated PIGC coding variant. In the current study, we were unable to detect an association between the PIGC locus and sCD14 in blacks. Even though the variant is more common in blacks, our black sample size was considerably smaller than our EA sample; therefore, power was only 43% to detect an effect of similar magnitude in blacks. Other possible explanations for the lack of replication in blacks include (1) a false-positive result (type I error) or overestimation of the effect (winner's curse) in EA; (2) effect modification by another genetic or environmental factor that is differentially expressed between EA and blacks; (3) rs1063412 may not be the true causal variant, and the frequency of the true causal variant differs between EA and blacks and is not well tagged in blacks.

In population studies of older adults, serum levels of CRP and IL-6 predict adverse health outcomes and mortality. Though sCD14 is an acute-phase protein and correlates with CRP and IL-6, we found that sCD14 and IL-6 were strong and independent risk factors for mortality in older adults. Accounting for IL-6 and sCD14, there was no association of CRP or fibrinogen with mortality. sCD14 levels are increased in a number of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and higher levels have been associated with disease severity, including mortality in Gram-negative sepsis. Conversely, in mouse models, CD14 deficiency has been associated with resistance to LPS-induced shock, whereas mice harboring toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and CD14 mutations have increased bone mineral density, decreased body fat, greater insulin sensitivity, live long lives, and show no evidence of infection. Increasing evidence suggests that proinflammatory mediators play a direct role in aging-related chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Whether higher levels of sCD14 or other inflammatory mediators are directly causal or indicative of chronic low-level infection and other immune alterations in older adults, or simply reflect worsening subclinical and clinical disease, is difficult to distinguish. Nonetheless, sCD14 may have potential clinical utility as a marker of aging, disease risk, or disease progression in older adults.

Our results show that sCD14 levels are associated with both subclinical vascular disease (carotid intima-media thickness and ABI) and with the risk of future clinical CVD in older adults, independently of other risk factors. The reason for the negative association between sCD14 and BMI is unclear, though the inter-relationships between the CD14 system and obesity appear to be complex. sCD14 can both potentiate and down-regulate responses to LPS. For example, adipose tissue CD14 gene expression is increased in obese humans, whereas mice harboring CD14 mutations have decreased body fat. In contrast, administration of exogenous recombinant human sCD14 is associated with decreased visceral fat and adipocyte inflammatory gene expression in high-fat-fed mice. Another possible explanation for the paradoxical association with sCD14 observed in CHS is that lower BMI could constitute a marker for frailty and chronic disease in older adults.There is no coherent text to be processed.
