Abstract

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is one of the key proteins in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). The role of CETP in atherosclerosis remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the associations between polymorphisms of CETP (mutations in intron 14 and exon 15, and Taq1B), hepatic lipase (C-514T), lipoprotein lipase (PvuII and HindIII), and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (R219K) loci and longevity in 256 centenarians and 190 healthy younger controls. Although heterozygous CETP deficiency and the B2 allele of the Taq1B polymorphism were consistently associated with higher HDL-C concentrations both in centenarians and controls, the allelic frequencies of those polymorphisms did not differ between the two groups. The allelic frequencies of other gene polymorphisms in RCT were not different between the two groups. Centenarians with lipoprotein lipase P(/) genotype had significantly higher HDL-C concentration than those with P(/+) or with P(+/+). In contrast, there was no such a relationship among controls. In stepwise multiple regression analysis, serum albumin, CETP deficiency, and lipoprotein lipase PvuII genotype were independently associated with HDL-C in centenarians. Sex, CETP deficiency, and the Taq1B genotype were also independently associated with HDL-C; however, lipoprotein lipase PvuII genotype had no significant effect on their HDL-C in controls. In conclusion, we observed that CETP deficiency and other gene polymorphisms in RCT have no impact on longevity for Japanese centenarians.

French [20], Finnish [21], and Japanese centenarians [23, 24, 25]. It is interesting to investigate associations between CETP deficiency and longevity in Japan, where the prevalence of deficiency is extremely high and the life expectancy is longest around the world. It is also worth examining the hypothesis that rather than a defect of risk factor for atherosclerosis, protective factors by nature could be advantageous for longevity. Therefore we have examined the associations of CETP deficiency as well as other genetic polymorphisms involved in RCT and longevity in 256 Japanese centenarians and 190 younger controls.

Introduction

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has potentially antiatherogenic properties. Numerous epidemiological studies have confirmed that a low level of HDL-C is a strong risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) [1]; however, there is evidence that not quantity but underlying mechanisms of high HDL-C levels are important for preventing atherosclerosis [2, 3]. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which enhances cholesterol efflux from the arterial wall and transports it to the liver for reuse or excretion into bile, has been proposed as one of the possible antiatherogenic mechanisms of HDL. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a carrier protein in RCT, which mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins, thus enhancing RCT. The role of CETP in atherosclerosis remains controversial. Several mutations have been described at the CETP gene locus that cause depletion of CETP activity and consequently high HDL-C in plasma, especially in Japan [4, 5]. It has been demonstrated that CETP deficiency exhibits atherogenicity when combined with serum HDL-C levels lower than 60 mg/dl [6] or with low activity of hepatic lipase [7Corrected Text:

Significantly higher levels of HDL-C (67.12 vs. 53.14 mg/dl, P<0.0001), apoA1 (151.18 vs. 138.17 mg/dl, P=0.0018), and CETP mass (3.91±1.0 vs. 3.50±0.7 g/ml, P=0.014), and lower levels of triglyceride (7646 vs. 13998 mg/dl, P=0.0002 by using logarithmically transformed value), apoB (8020 vs. 9826 mg/dl, P<0.0001), and body mass index (20.5±2.2 vs. 23.6±3.3, P<0.0001) were observed in centenarians as compared to male controls.

Recently, there have been many findings from studies that have extensively investigated the associations between genetic predisposition for fatal disease and longevity [20, 21, 22, 23]. For example, the allele of the apoE gene which is related not only to an increase risk for CAD but also to the development of lipid measurements.

Nonfasting venous blood (20 ml) was collected from all subjects. Plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation at 4°C.

Promoter polymorphism of the HL gene (C-514T) was determined as developed by Couture et al. [29] with the following primer: 5-TCT AGG ATC ACC TCT CAA TGG GTC A-3 and 5-GGT GGC TTC CAC GTG GCT GCC TAA G-3.

The concentrations of total cholesterol and triglyceride were determined by automated enzymatic procedures. The concentrations of HDL-C were determined after precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins with phosphotungstic Mg2+. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated from the Friedewald formula. The concentrations of apoA1 and apoB were determined by turbidimetric immunoassay. The concentrations of lipoprotein(a) were measured by latex agglutination immunoassay. Plasma CETP concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercial kit [26] (CETP ELISA, Chugai, Tokyo).

The R219K polymorphism of the ABCA1 gene was recently identified by Clee et al. [16]. The PCR primer was as follows: 5-GTA TTT TTG CAA GGC TAC CAG TTA CAT TTG ACA A-3 and 5-GAT TGG CTT CAG GAT GTC CAT GTT GGA A-3. PCR was conducted with denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, annealing at 60°C for 1 min and primer extension at 72°C for 1.5 min for a total of 30 cycles. After digestion with EcoNI, the resulting fragment is a 177-bp for the R allele and 107 and 100 bp fragments for the K allele.

DNA mutation and polymorphism cell by phenol extraction. CETP mutation in intron 14 (Int14A) was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method as described by Inazu et al. [4Consistently associated with HDL-C concentrations (P=0.0003 and t-test, respectively) and with markedly lower CETP concentration (P<0.0001 and t-test, respectively). In regard to the genotype, the B2 allele was significantly associated with lower CETP mass and higher HDL-C in controls (P=0.0387 and P=0.029, ANOVA), and a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in centenarians. The B2 allele was also associated with lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.024). There was a significant association of the P( ) allele of the LPL gene with higher HDL-C concentrations in centenarians, but this relationship was not observed in controls. There was no significant association between ABCA1 genotype parameters either in centenarians or in controls. Neither the LPL HindIII polymorphism nor the promoter polymorphism had a significant association with lipid parameters in centenarians and are not shown. When men and women were analyzed separately, the same results as shown in Table were observed in centenarians of both sexes; however, statistical power was less in male centenarians. There was a significant association between alleles frequencies of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport between centenarians and controls (Fig. 1). Comparison of alleles frequencies between centenarians and controls were calculated by 2 test. No significant difference was observed.

Two common CETP deficiencies, an intron 14 splicing defect [4] and an exon 15 missense mutation [5], have been reported in the Japanese population. In this study, there was no subject who was identified as homozygous CETP deficiency. There was no difference in frequencies of either type of heterozygous CETP deficiencies between centenarians and controls.

The distributions of the Taq1B polymorphism of the CETP gene, the LPL PvuII and HindIII genotype, the C-514T polymorphism of the HL gene and recently identified R219K variant of the ABCA1 gene did not differ between centenarians and controls. For CETP mutations, unpaired t-tests were used (TC total cholesterol, LDL-C low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL-C high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TG triglyceride, CETP cholesteryl ester transfer protein).

[7] reported that hyperalphalipoproteinemia caused by CETP gene deficiency can be associated with increased CAD when combined with low HL activity. Hirano et al. [7] also noted the interesting finding that CETP deficiency may not be susceptible to CAD if accompanied by higher LPL activity. These findings indicate that the pro-atherogeneity of CETP deficiency may be compensated by other genetic and circumstantial factors, such as key enzymes synergistically involved in reverse cholesterol transport and/or the antiatherogenic property of HDL particles themselves. However, in the study, there was no significant difference in demographics and biochemical parameters except HDL-C and CETP mass between centenarians with CETP deficiency and those with the wild type. Neither did the frequency of the C allele of the promoter polymorphism in the HL gene, which may be associated with an increased risk of CAD, differ between the two groups (0.500, 0.504, P=0.961, respectively). Compatible with results from several epidemiological studies [8, 9, 31], we demonstrated that the B2 allele is associated with lower CETP mass and higher HDL-C concentration in both centenarians and controls; however, we found no significant association of the allele with longevity. The result remained unchanged after excluding the participants with CETP deficiency. Ordovas et al. [32] reported that the B2 allele is associated with higher HDL-C and lower CAD risk only in men, not in women, in a population-based sample from the Framingham Offspring Study. In the present study, even after restriction to men, there was no difference in frequencies of B2 alleles among centenarians and controls (0.400, 0.443, P=0.472, respectively). The reason for the lack of association of two polymorphisms of CETP gene with longevity was unclear. Therefore, we calculated haplotype frequencies of the 442D:G and Taq1B polymorphisms of the CETP gene in centenarians and controls (Table 7). Despite the limited sample size, we found an extremely lower frequency of 442D:G and B1B1 haplotype than of 442D:G and B2B2 in centenarians (P=0.0328, 2). The frequency of the haplotype in centenarians seems to be lower than that in controls (P=0.2489, 2). The result indicated that the 442D:G and B1B1 haplotype in the CETP gene could be disadvantageous for longevity. The findings should be investigated in a future study with a large sample size.

We found a significant association between the LPL PvuII( / ) genotype and higher HDL-C concentration in centenarians but not in controls. Results from epidemiological studies on the association between the LPL genotype and serum lipid have been conflicting. Chamberlain et al. [11] reported significant associations between the LPL PvuII(+/+) genotype and higher triglycerides and lower HDL-C. Wang et al. [12] confirmed a similar effect of the LPL PvuII(+) allele on triglycerides but not on HDL-C concentrations in whites. Gerdes et al. [13] reported that dose-dependent associations of the LPL HindIII H(+) allele with higher HDL-C, while no significant association between the LPL PvuII genotype and any lipid variables in middle-aged Danish men. The inconsistency of those results could be due not only to ethnicity but also to confounding factors such as abdominal adiposity and other cardiovascular risk factors which may affect the significance of the LPL genotype. In the present study, multiple regression analysis revealed that the determinants of HDL-C concentration are quite different between centenarians and controls, suggesting that the relationship between LPL polymorphisms and lipid levels could be modulated by environmental factors as previously described by Wang et al. [12]. It is possible that the LPL genotype has a dual function on lipid metabolism in relation to middle or old age. Methods in evaluating the overall efficacy of reverse cholesterol transport are required to investigate which combination of candidate gene polymorphisms could be optimum for human longevity.

Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology. Reference is associated with longevity in centenarians in Japan, where the prevalence of the deficiency is extremely high. In addition, despite a significant impact of several genetic polymorphisms in RCT on plasma HDL-C concentrations in centenarians, there was no frequency difference between centenarians and controls for these polymorphisms. These results, however, should be interpreted cautiously. There could be several reasons for our negative results. First, it may be true that those loci have no impact on longevity. Our results were in line with those of Bladbjerg et al. [22] that demonstrated no associations of 11 gene polymorphisms chosen for their potential risk for CAD with longevity for Danish centenarians. These findings suggest the possibility that the genetic polymorphisms which have antiatherogenic or proatherogenic property could have no significant impact on longevity. Second, centenarians have been exposed during their lifetime to a very different environment than the control population and in other populations around the world where these loci have been examined for lipid metabolism and CAD risk. In the 1970s when centenarians were most susceptible to CAD, their daily intake of fat was less than 10% of the calories in the Japanese population; however, nowadays it rises to 25% and over (Ministry of Health and Welfare, National Nutrition Survey in Japan, 2000). Considering the low risk for CAD in the population and the low-fat diet traditionally consumed in Japan, it is not surprising that candidate genes for lipid metabolism have little effect on longevity. Third, it is possible that our study design and sample size may not have enough statistical power to address this issue.
