Abstract Genes involved in cardiovascular dis- eases (CVD) play an opposite role in human longevity. The a1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine- protease inhibitor required for the prevention of proteolytic tissue damage, by neutrophil elastase. The role of AAT in CVD has not been defini- tively assessed and its effect on longevity has not yet fully been studied. To clarify these points, we

have studied the distribution of AAT allele vari- ants in 3 cohorts: 127 young patients affected by acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 255 young controls and 143 centenarians from Sicily. The Z allele frequency was most frequent in centenari- ans (13.3%), intermediate in healthy young con- trols (3.1%) and less frequent in AMI patients (1.2%) (P = 0.0000001). The heterozygous MZ genotype was significantly over represented in centenarians (38/143) and under represented in AMI patients (3/127) with intermediate values in young controls (16/255) (P = 0.0000001). After adjustment for well-recognized AMI risk factors, the MZ genotype still predicted a significant negative risk factor for developing AMI in the Sicilian population. Thus, our data show a posi- tive role of MZ heterozygosity in attainment of successful ageing linked to the positive effects of this genotype versus the cardiovascular ischemic diseases.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), also referred to as a -proteinase inhibitor (Pi), is a 52 kD glycopro- 1 tein secreted by hepatocytes and, to a lesser extent, by lung epithelial cells and phagocytes, into the plasma at a concentration of 1.9–3.5 mg/ml. It is proposed to play an important role in protect- ing vulnerable elastic tissue in the lungs, gut, and vasculature from degradation by neutrophil elas- tase and its severe deficiency is involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (De Meo and Silverman 2004; Lomas and Parfrey 2004; Luisetti and Seersholm 2004). The Pi gene, located on chromosome 14q32.1 (OMIM: 107400), is 12.2 Kb in length with seven exons and six introns. The encoded protein includes 394 amino acids with the active site of the enzyme inhibitor at methionine 358. It inhibits a variety of serine proteinases but its preferred target is neu- trophil elastase that is bound to active site and permanently inactivated (De Meo and Silverman

assessed. A Danish study (Dahl et al. found that ZZ AAT deficiency and MZ deficiency patients affected by cor- artery disease (CAD) have lower blood than MM/MS patients. Furthermore, heterozygosity was associated with reduced of ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) CAD. The authors supposed that neutrophil can play a favourable role in CVD destroying elastic tissue of the arterial it alters the distensibility of the vessel wall thus blood pressure and cardiac load. Since blood pressure is protective against ICVD CAD, AAT deficiency might be associated reduced risk of development of these dis- through this mechanism (Ooyama and 1995; Zureik et al. 2002; Dahl et al. However, in that year, another report seemingly contrasting results (Talmud al. 2003). In fact, the other authors demon- that the progression of atherosclerosis was with low AAT levels. They suggested elastase activity attributable to AAT defi- accelerates hardening of arterial walls and (Talmud et al. 2003). However, analysis was very limited in scope and num- (several dozens of patients), and mostly dealt

More than 100 genetic variants of AAT have been identified and these are strictly associated with specific AAT plasma levels in a co-domi- nantly inherited fashion. Current listings of all polymorphisms can be derived by visiting a database found at: http://www.innateimmuni- ty.net (De Meo and Silverman 2004; Luisetti and Seersholm 2004). The most common allele is PiM; MM homozygotes product a normal level of AAT. Other common variants are PiZ and PiS. The PiZ variant, Glu342 to Lys, results in a severe protein deficiency that is characterised in the homozygote state by levels of plasma concentra- tions lower by 84% when compared with levels in MM individuals and in the MZ heterozygote state by intermediate levels lower by 17%. So, Z homozygosity is a proven genetic risk factor for COPD and emphysema. The PiS variant, Glu264 to Val, is associated in homozygosity with AAT levels lower by 7% when compared with levels in MM and in MS individuals with AAT levels lower by 3%. This S variant is not associated to an increased chance of the symptomatology by defi- ciency syndrome. However, PI MZ and PI MS

To date, the lifespan of MZ carriers has not yet fully been analysed. Although in the Danish study MZ heterozygosity was associated with increased age, centenarians, the best model of successful ageing (Franceschi et al. 2005), were not studied (Dahl et al. 2003). It is conceivable that lifespan of MZ subjects should depend on the suscepti- bility to COPD, a life-threatening disease. How- ever, the risk of COPD in PiMZ heterozygotes has been analyzed in several studies, without consistent results. Studies performed to date have both supported and refuted an increased risk of COPD in PI MZ individuals, with case control studies typically finding some increased risk for COPD in PI MZ subjects and population based

consisted of 143 Sicilian centenarians, whose age was verified by archival records at the City Hall and/or Church registries. We paid particular attention to the concordance between reported age and personal chronologies (age of marriage and of military service for men, age of first and last pregnancy for women, age of children, among others). They did not have any cardiac risk factors or major age-related diseases (e.g., CAD, severe cognitive impairment, severe physical impair- ment, clinically evident cancer or renal insuffi- ciency), although some had decreased auditory and visual acuity. The characteristics of patient and control groups are reported in Table 1. The Sicilian ethnicity of the participants at the study was established by confirming that all four grandparents were born in Sicily; immigration and intermarriage has historically been rare. The University Hospital Ethics Committee approved the project and an informed consent was obtained from each individual.

Comparison of the DNA sequences of healthy young people with the healthy, extremely old population may reveal genes that heavily partic- ipate in the determination of long life (Bessenyei et al. 2004). Thus, to clarify the role of AAT in CVD and longevity, we have studied the distri- bution of AAT allele variants in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, age-matched controls and centenarians.

Materials and methods

We enrolled 127 patients admitted at the Cardiac Unit of Palermo University Hospital (Italy) as they were affected by AMI. To improve the power of our study, we selected genetically loaded cases having early AMI onset (Marenberg et al. 1994). The diagnosis of AMI was based on typical electrocardiography changes and increased serum activities of relevant enzymes and confirmed by echocardiography and coronary angiography. The healthy age matched control group of 255 subjects was recruited amongst stu- dents or staff personnel who were checked and judged to be in good health based on their clinical history and on blood tests (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, C reactive protein, liver function tests, iron, proteins, cho- lesterol, triglycerides). The second control group

Blood specimens were collected in tripotassi- um EDTA sterile tubes, DNA extracted (Miller et al. 1998) and processed for genotyping according to published protocols. Our procedure for mutation analysis was modified from the PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis method of Tazelaar et al. (1992) according to Lam et al. 1997. Allele and genotypic frequencies were evaluated by gene count and differences in fre- quency among the groups. The v2 test (2 · 2 and 3 · 3 tables, where appropriate) and ODD ratio (OR) with confidence interval (CI) were calcu- lated. The data were tested for the goodness of fit between the observed and expected genotype

frequencies of MZ genotypes and Z alleles was obtained between centenarians and both young controls and AMI patients. The frequency of MZ genotype and Z allele in AMI patients was lower than that observed in young healthy controls, but the datum was not significant. Finally, we per- formed a logistic regression analysis to test the association of genotypes with AMI after taking into account smoking habits, family history of CAD and the presence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and hyper- triglyceridemia. By performing a multiple logistic regression analysis to test the association of MZ genotype with AMI considering the previous risk factors, significant differences in genotype fre- quency were observed between 117 male AMI patients and 107 male young controls and per- sisted between 117 male AMI patients and 46 male centenarians (Table 4). These results indi- cate that the MZ genotype is an independent negative risk factor for developing AMI in the male Sicilian population.

frequencies according to Hardy-Weinberg equi- librium (HWE), by v2 test. Due to the different number of women in the groups under study, lo- gistic regression analysis was performed only in men. We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to test the association of MZ genotype with AMI taking into account smoking habits, family history of CAD and the presence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholester- olemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The OR (with CI) was calculated as exponential of regression coefficient and its standard error.

Results

Table 2 shows the frequency of AAT M, Z, S alleles in the groups under study. The Z allele frequency was most frequent in centenarians (13.3%), intermediate in healthy young controls (3.1%) and less frequent in AMI patients (1.2%) (P = 0.0000001). None of the Sicilian subjects was the ZZ, SS homozygotes and SZ heterozygotes. The heterozygous MZ genotype was significantly over represented in centenarians (38/143) and under represented in AMI patients (3/127) with intermediate values in young controls (16/255) (Table 3, P = 0.0000001). All the genotypes were in HWE.

Discussion

The risk of CVD in patients with severe AAT deficiency has not been sufficiently investigated to formulate firm conclusions. There should be a theoretical association between aortic aneurismal disease and AAT deficiency due to uninhibited

elastase activity on the elastic tissue of arterial walls, but this has not been supported in pub- lished data nor has an association been shown with intracranial aneurysms (St Jean et al. 1996; Needham and Stockley 2004). However, elastin is a major component of vessel wall elastic lamina, and degradation of elastic fibbers may be impor- tant in the lowering of blood pressure, which is a well-known risk factor for CVD and AMI. Increased elastase activity attributable to AAT deficiency has therefore been claimed to play a favourable role in CVD because destroying elas- tic tissue of the arterial wall, it alters the disten- sibility of the vessel wall and so blood pressure and cardiac load (Robert et al. 1998; Dahl et al. 2003). In fact, in a Danish study the PI Z and PIMZ phenotypes have been associated with lower blood pressure in men and PI MZ has been associated with a reduced risk of ICVD and CAD (Dahl et al. 2003). However, in another study opposite results have been reported (Talmud et al. 2003). The causes of the discrepancies are not clear, but the inclusion criteria, the study populations, and the measured endpoint differed substantially among the two studies (Dahl et al. 2003; Talmud et al. 2003).

population since the frequencies of healthy con- trols are close to those expected from literature data. In Caucasoids the most common alleles are the M variants with allele frequencies of greater than 0.95, the Z variant occurring with a fre- quency of 0.01–0.03 (de Serres et al. 2003; Lomas and Parfrey 2004). So, according to Danish data, our results support a protective role for Z allele in CVD. Besides, they show a positive role of MZ heterozygosity in attainment of successful ageing likely linked to the positive effects of this geno- type versus the cardiovascular ischemic diseases. Concerning the meaning of our results, as

Concerning the meaning of our results, as previously discussed, a better control of blood pressure in AAT deficiency has been proposed (Robert et al. 1998; Dahl et al. 2003). However, it has to point out that the interaction of AAT with elastase results in the suicide cleavage of AAT. During this process, the C-terminal 36 amino acids (C-36) are cleaved off yet remain attached to the complex. This C-36 cleaved peptide is biologically active and increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) binding and internalization, upregulates the LDL-receptor, induces cytokine and glutathione production. Thus, there is strong suggestive evidence that C-36 participates in inflammatory processes involved in atherogenesis. AAT deficiency could lead to less cleaved frag- ments of AAT in atherosclerotic plaques and thereby reduce atherosclerotic inflammation and

The aim of this report was to investigate whe- ther the variants of AAT gene play an opposite role in AMI and longevity. To this purpose, all the subjects were screened for M, Z and S alleles which are the more common variants. We found a higher frequency of MZ heterozygosity and Z allele in centenarians respect to controls and AMI patients. In agreement with these results, Z allele was overrepresented in longevous and underrep- resented in patients with AMI with intermediate value in young controls. These results are not due to bias in allele frequencies assessment in our

Therefore, present results add another piece of evidence to our hypothesis that people genetically predisposed to a reduced cardiovascular risk, have less chance to develop CVD and, therefore, greater chance to live longer. Genetic polymor- phisms responsible for a low inflammatory response may result in an increased chance of

long lifespan in an environment with a reduced pathogen burden and improved control of severe infections by antibiotics since such a modern and healthy environment permits a lower grade of survivable atherogenic inflammatory response (Lio et al. 2004; Balistreri et al. 2004; Caruso et al. 2004, 2005; Grimaldi et al. 2006; Licastro et al. 2005; Candore et al. 2006a, b). In any case, all these data point out the strong relationship between genetics, CVD and longevity.
