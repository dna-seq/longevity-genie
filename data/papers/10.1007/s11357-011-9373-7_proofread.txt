Evidence from case-control and longitudinal studies supports associations of genetic variation in APOE, CETP, IL6, and IL6R with human longevity. In a case-control study of 1,089 oldest-old (ages 92-93) and 736 middle-aged Danes, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs769449 (APOE) was significantly decreased in the oldest-old, while the MAF of rs9923854 (CETP) was significantly enriched. These effects were supported when investigating 1,104 oldest-old (ages 95-110) and 1,104 middle-aged Danes. Rs769449 was in modest linkage (R20 0.55) with rs429358 of the APOE-4 haplotype, and adjusting for rs429358 eliminated the effect of rs769449, indicating that the association reflects the well-known effect of rs429358. Family-based analysis confirmed the effects of variation in APOE and CETP and furthermore pointed to IL6 as a longevity gene. In a longitudinal study with 11 years of follow-up on survival in the Danes, only one SNP, rs2069827 (IL6), was significantly associated with survival from age 92 (p=0.064). This advantageous effect of the G allele was supported when investigating a second longitudinal cohort (N=563) of oldest-old (age ≥95 years). Since rs2069827 was located in a putative transcription factor binding site, quantitative RNA studies were conducted. However, no difference in expression was observed between rs2069827 groups. In conclusion, we here support and expand evidence suggesting that genetic variation in CETP, IL6, and possible HSPA14 is associated with human longevity.

Introduction

Approximately 25% of the variation in human lifespan is thought to be caused by genetic variation (Herskind et al. 1996), a contribution considered to be minimal before age 60 years and most profound after age 85 years (Hjelmborg et al. 2006). Candidate genes for longevity encode proteins engaged in different biological processes including lipoprotein metabolism and inflammatory processes (Christensen et al. 2006). In this study, we investigated 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the common genetic variation in 16 genes recurrently regarded as candidates for human longevity: APOE, ACE, CETP, HFE, IL6, IL6R, MTHFR, TGFB1, APOA4, APOC3, SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT6, HSPA1A, HSPA1L, and HSPA14. Of these genes, only SIRT1 and SIRT3 have previously been investigated by a tagging SNP approach in a candidate association study (Flachsbart et al. 2006; Kuningas et al. 2007; Lescai et al. 2009). We explored the apolipoprotein E, C3, and A4 genes (APOE, APOC3, and APOA4), all of which are involved in lipoprotein metabolism and believed to affect longevity (Christensen et al. 2006). The APOE-4 haplotype is by far the most validated genetic variation and has repeatedly been associated with human longevity (e.g., Asada et al. 1996; Bathum et al. 2006; Deelen et al. 2011; Gerdes et al. 2000; McKay et al. 2011; Nebel et al. 2011; Schachter et al. 1994), whereas one study has found an association of rs2542052 in APOC3 with longevity (Atzmon et al. 2006). We also investigated the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), for which rs5882 has been reported as a longevity SNP (Barzilai et al. 2003). Genes encoding proteins engaged in immune regulatory processes are also key candidates for longevity (reviewed in Jylhava and Hurme 2010). Frequently discussed is the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) and its receptor alpha (IL6R); in IL6, a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and a 174C/G polymorphism (rs1800795) have been described as associated with longevity (Capurso et al. 2007; Christiansen et al. 2004; Hurme et al. 2005; Rea et al. 2003). Another cytokine gene often suggested is the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene (TGF-β1), which is involved, among others, in regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. In TGF-β1, the +915 polymprobably function as intracellular regulatory proteins affecting, for example, IGF1/insulin signaling and DNA repair, although their roles are not entirely clear (Olmos et al. 2011). In SIRT3, a G477T polymorphism (Rose et al. 2003) and a VNTR polymorphism (Bellizzi et al. 2005) have been put forward as longevity polymorphisms. Finally, we examined three genes not belonging to any of these biological processes but still considered reliable candidates in previous studies: the highly discussed candidate gene angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), for which the I/D insertion/deletion (tagged by rs4343 (Abdollahi et al. 2008)) has been reported by several authors to be associated with longevity (Arias-Vasquez et al. 2005; Cellini et al. 2005; Frederiksen et al. 2003; Luft 1999; Novelli et al. 2008; Schachter et al. 1994; Zajc et al. 2012); the iron absorption regulatory protein hfe, for which the Cys282Tyr variation (rs1800562) was found to decrease with age (Bathum et al. 2001; Lio et al. 2002); and finally, MTHFR, which is of importance for the essential remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, where the C677T (rs1801133) polymorphism has been suggested as associated with longevity (Stessman et al. 2005; Todesco et al. 1999). Subjects A considerable number of the associations mentioned above could not be replicated in subsequent studies. These studies include rs2542052 in APOC3 (Novelli et al. 2008), rs5882 in CETP (Cellini et al. 2005; Novelli et al. 2008), I/D insertion/deletion in ACE (Agerholm-Larsen et al. 1997; Bladbjerg et al.  Detailed characteristics for the discovery cohorts were previously described in (Soerensen et al. 2010). In short, the study population of oldest-old were 1,200 participants from The Danish 1905 Birth Cohort Study (Nybo et al. 2001), while the 800 younger controls were singleton participants from the Study of Middle-Aged Danish Twins (Skytthe et al. 2002). The survival status information was retrieved from the Danish Central Population Register (Pedersen et al. 2006), and the vital status was followed until death or January 1, 2010. After data cleaning, the final sample size was 1,089 oldest-old and 736 middle-aged individuals. Permission to collect blood samples and usage of register-based information was granted by The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (see Online Resource 1). The chromosomal regions investigated are the gene regions plus 5,000 kb upstream and 1,000 kb downstream. Tagging SNPs were identified via HapMap consortium database (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html.en, CEU cohort) and analyzed using the HaploView software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview; Barrett et al. 2005). Finally, for optimal genotyping, SNPs known to perform poorly on the Illumina GoldenGate genotyping platform were excluded. Genotyping DNA was isolated from blood spot cards using the QIAamp DNA Mini and Micro Kits (Qiagen, Germany); genotyping was performed using Illumina GoldenGate technology (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA), and data clean-up, data verification, and reproducibility checks were conducted as previously described (Soerensen et al. 2010). In total, 16 SNPs were excluded, leading to 102 SNPs for data analysis. Genotyping in the German and Dutch study populations was performed using Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEXGold technology (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA); see the Supplementary Material (Online Resource 1) for details. Study populations for replication of initial findings For replication of the initial observations from the Danish case-control study, two German samples of 1,613 unrelated long-lived individuals (age 95-110) and 1,140 middle-aged controls (mean age 67.2) were used. The participants were identified through local registry offices and from the Federal Administrative Office. They were recruited from the different geographic regions of Germany and were all of German ancestry (Nebel et al. 2005). Approval was received from the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein. For replication of initial findings from theThe SNPs were analyzed, and the P-set value was corrected for multiple testing based on the number of SNPs in each gene. In the replication study, genotype data from the Leiden 85-plus Study were used to perform survival analysis using a sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model in Stata 11.1. Kaplan Meier plots were generated for the Dutch and Danish cohorts in Stata 11.1. For all analyses, a nominal significance level of 0.05 was set, and correction for multiple testing was performed using the permutation approach with max(T) permutation mode set at 10,000 permutations for analyses carried out in Plink and R software. LD estimates for APOE SNPs were obtained using Plink software, and the LD data were used in HaploView software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview; Barrett et al. 2005) to generate an APOE LD plot. The expression measurements of IL6 data were analyzed using linear regression of C and rs2069827 genotype data in STATA 11.1 statistical program, adjusting for age at blood sampling (the latter was initially observed to be a confounder). The assumptions of normal distribution and equal variance were tested for Ct by Shapiro Wilk and Breusch Pagan/Cook Weisberg tests. A box plot of mean Ct by rs2069827 genotype groups was generated in STATA 11.1. In the Danish longitudinal study, two survival variables were applied to explore the genetic contribution to surviving for a short period versus a longer period during the ninth decade of life. The distribution of survival times was right-skewed (data not shown); hence, a cutoff with respect to survival data on the oldest-old Danes was performed.

The analyses were repeated while stratifying by gender since the association of SNPs with longevity has previously been suggested to differ between genders. The sex-specific analyses of rs9923854 (CETP) and rs769449 (APOE) were in complete agreement with the result of the combined group, although rs769449 (APOE) did not pass correction for multiple testing (see Supplementary Table 3, Online Resource 4). The 102 genotyped SNPs in the 16 candidate genes are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (Online Resource 2), whereas the Danish discovery cohorts and German and Dutch replication populations are described in Table 1. Gene-based analysis confirmed the association of variations in CETP and APOE with longevity (see Table 3). HSPA14 and SIRT6 also showed significance in the gene-based analysis, but the gene-based P value for SIRT6 reflected the association of only a single SNP, since the remaining SIRT6 SNPs were insignificant at the single-marker level (data not shown). Comparison of allele frequencies between middle-aged and oldest-old Danes showed more significant findings than expected by chance (see Supplementary Table 2, Online Resource 3) and left two out of 102 SNPs significant after correction for multiple testing. The minor allele frequency of rs9923854 (CETP) was enriched in the 92-93-year-olds, implying that this allele is advantageous for survival from middle-age to old age (OR >1). In contrast, rs769449 (APOE) displayed a decreased prevalence of the minor allele, thus indicating a disadvantageous effect on survival (OR <1). Analysis of genotype frequencies supported these findings. Haplotype case-control comparisons identified three haplotypes significantly associated with longevity after correction for multiple testing; all three included either rs9923854 (CETP) or rs769449 (APOE) and demonstrated effects in line with the single-SNP analysis. The data are summarized in Table 2.

In the German population of 1,613 oldest-old and 1,104 middle-aged individuals, the APOE and CETP SNPs were analyzed, and rs769449 (APOE) was supported at the allelic level, whereas rs9923854 (CETP) showed borderline significance at the allelic level (95% CI (OR) 0.960-1.358) and was supported at the genotype level (see Table 4). Regression analysis on survival data on the oldest-old Danes was performed to investigate whether the two SNPs also affected survival during old age. We found no effect of rs769449 (APOE), while rs9923854 (CETP) showed nominal significance in females separately, with an estimate pointing in the same direction as observed in the case-control comparison (the data are summarized in Table 4). From the regression analysis, the quantitative effect of carrying at least one rs2069827 A allele was estimated to be 0.77 and 0.74 additional years of survival for AA/AC.The corrected and processed text is:

Males and females had a mean survival time of 2.91 and 3.74 years, respectively, for rs2069827-CC males and females, indicating a considerable effect. The study evaluated the association of 102 SNPs with survival at advanced ages and estimated their quantitative effects through regression analyses of survival variables using 11 years of follow-up data from the cohort of oldest-old Danes. The Dutch prospective cohort and Danish case-control data were also used for replication studies.

Investigation of the single borderline significant IL6 SNP in the Dutch replication cohort using Cox regression supported an effect on late-life survival; HR 0.74. qPCR investigation of IL6 expression did not show any significant difference in mRNA levels between genotype groups for rs2069827 (P value 0.532).

Several candidate genes have been explored for their role in human longevity, including APOE, CETP, and MTHFR. Retrospectively inspecting these SNPs in the data shows that only rs4343 (ACE) was nominally significantly associated with longevity (P<0.05), while no effect of the other two SNPs could be noted. Thus, these results emphasize that a single-marker candidate approach might point to a specific polymorphism but does not enable conclusions on the possible relevance of variation in the gene region as such.

To facilitate the confirmation of the relevance of a number of well-known candidate genes for longevity, we extended the examination of these genes to cover the majority of the common variation in the regions by using a total of 102 tagging SNPs. Applying the case-control approach, two SNPs, rs769449 (APOE) and rs9923854 (CETP), were found to be associated with longevity. The effect of these was supported by haplotype and gene-based analyses.

The German replication population also supported these findings, pointing to the importance of genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism for longevity. The effect of APOE rs769449 most likely reflected the well-known effect of the APOE 4 haplotype defining rs429358 and was not evident in advanced age survival. Rs9923854 (CETP) did show nominal effects on survival during old age, but only in females, indicating that the effect of this SNP might become gender specific toward the most late part of life.

HSPA14 belongs to the same functional group as HSPA1A and HSPA1L (70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70s)) previously reported as associated with human longevity. The level of the entire gene indicated a positive effect of the rare variants of HSPA14 on survival from middle-aged to old-aged. Hsp14 (also named hsp70L1) is a rather recently identified hsp70 protein and is known to be located in ribosomes, probably playing a role in the folding of newly translated proteins. Accordingly, the rare alleles of the HSPA14 SNPs reported here could be hypothesized to enhance such activity and avoid accumulation of newly translated proteins during aging. However, hsp14 also enhances cellular immunity in dendrites, e.g., stimulating secretion of for instance IL12 and TNF, and has therefore beenSuggested as an adjuvant for the treatment of cancer and infectious disease (Wu et al. 2005). An enhancement of such effects could intuitively be considered to pose a positive effect on longevity, although the connection between immune regulatory processes and longevity is, as explained below, probably not that straightforward.

The relation of immune regulatory genes to longevity is in general based on the idea of a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes since aging is accompanied by both a decline in several immune functions (immunosenescence) and an increase in a chronic low-grade inflammation state (inflammaging). The genetic polymorphisms associated with longevity are presumed to increase the ability to cope with inflammaging (Jylhava and Hurme 2010). Therefore, one might expect the rare allele of rs2069827 (IL6) to hold a low pro-inflammatory activity. Such low activity could presumably be caused by low IL6 expression, yet in our qPCR study, we observed no difference in IL6 mRNA levels between rs2069827 genotype groups. Hence, the impact of this SNP does not appear to be mediated through changes in IL6 expression. Finally, rs2069827 may simply be a proxy for a causal variant not genotyped in the present study.

In conclusion, we here add data to the proposed roles of 16 frequently discussed candidate genes indicating that variation in APOE and CETP and possible HSPA14 is of importance in survival from middle age to old age whereas genetic variation in IL6 seems to affect survival during late life.
