Abstract The SHC1 gene encodes a signaling and transforming protein that has been implicated in the aging process in worms and mammals. In this study we examined 230 Japanese centenarians and 180 healthy younger controls and looked at the SHC1 locus as a candidate region that may be associated with longevity. We identified 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a 10-kb region encompassing the entire SHC1 gene from the DNA of 30 centenarians and 24 healthy younger controls. Five SNPs, including three nonsynonymous sites, lay within coding elements, six were located within introns, and one was in the 30 untranslated region. All of these SNPs were relatively rare, with a minor allele frequency of less than 5% in our

subjects. A pairwise linkage disequilibrium analysis using the r2 statistic showed that two of the SNP pairs are in tight linkage disequilibrium at this locus. We investigated the possible association of SHC1 with longevity using association analyses with allelotypes and haplotypes but found that the SNPs identified in SHC1 had no impact on longevity for Japanese centenarians.

Subjects

A total of 230 Japanese centenarians (168 women, 62 men, age 100.8€1.5 years) living in the Tokyo metropolitan area recruited between April 1999 and January 2001 for the second of the Tokyo Centenarian Study. Participants were identified the national registry of centenarians, published by the Ministry Health, Welfare, and Labor [11]. Among those enrolled 162 living at home, and 68 were institutionalized. None was in an care setting, and none was receiving tube feeding. included physical examination, measurement of body weight height, electrocardiography, and blood pressure Information regarding habitual food intake, alcohol smoking habits, physical and cognitive functioning, use of ication, and past medical history was also collected [11]. seven centenarians (20.4%) were receiving antihypertensive ment, and ten had a history of treatment for cancer (two cancer, two colon, two prostate, one bladder, two breast, and cancer of the uterus). Using the Mini-Mental State (MMSE) and clinical dementia rating criteria, 170 (73.9%) were found to have varying degrees of cognitive ment; this rate is similar to that of a previous study in Japan The regionally matched control subjects comprised 180 volunteers (116 women, 64 men, mean age 36.1€11.3 years, 22–65) who were recruited from hospital and institutional medical and nursing school students, and bank clerks. The subjects were free from diseases such as coronary artery stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Smoking and alcohol consumption moderate to nil. All subjects enrolled in this study were Nonfasting venous blood (20 ml) was collected from all and genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral according to standard protocols. Written informed consent obtained from all participants directly or by proxy. This study approved by the ethics committees of the Medical School of University and of the RIKEN Yokohama Institute.

Introduction

The influence of genes on aging and life expectancy is well established in species ranging from yeast to mammals. The shc1 gene was originally described as a proto-oncogene, encoding three different isoforms of shc1 proteins with molecular masses of 46, 52, and 66 kDa respectively [1]. Recently an unexpected correlation between life span and control of the oxidative stress response was reported. Targeted mutation of the shc1 gene locus caused ablation of a splice variant of relative molecular mass 66,000 (p66shc) and resulted in selective resistance to oxidative stress and an extended life span in the mouse [2]. On a high-fat diet, the p66shc(cid:1)/(cid:1) mouse showed a significant reduction in systemic and tissue oxidative stress, vascular cell apoptosis, and early atherosclerotic lesions, compared with the wild type animal [3]. Another recent study [4] suggested an important functional relationship between forkhead proteins, shc1, and intracellular oxidants, all of which are thought to be involved in the aging process in worms [5, 6] and mammals [7, 8]. These studies suggest a role for shc1 in the interrelation between oxidants, stress, and aging.

One of the most intriguing questions to arise from our current understanding of the science of aging is whether genes associated with longevity in various animal models have the same involvement in human aging processes. Centenarians, who are the best examples of human longevity, show less evidence of oxidative stress in plasma [9] and have a lower prevalence of carotid plaques [10] than aged control subjects, suggesting a possible overlap in the aging mechanisms between humans and mice. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the SHC1 gene, the human homologue of shc1, may have some association with exceptional longevity in humans. In this study we examined 230 Japanese centenarians and 180 healthy younger controls and looked at the SHC1 locus as a candidate region that may be associated with longevity.

Identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms

Genomic DNA and mRNA sequences of SHC1 were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers AL451085 and U73377, respective- ly). PCR primer sets were designed to amplify the SHC1 gene, including DNA 1 kb upstream of the first exon and 0.5 kb downstream of the last exon, with some overlap of PCR amplicons (Table 1). Following PCR amplification genomic DNA was sequenced using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA). In total five partially overlapping PCR fragments, each about 2 kb in length, were sequenced using 23 primers. Polymorphisms were identified by comparing sequences from 108 chromosomes from 30 Japanese centenarians and 24 younger controls, using the Sequencher program (Gene Codes, Mich., USA). Polymorphisms were confirmed by reamplifying and resequencing both strands using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit or real-time pyrophosphate DNA sequencing [13, 14] using a PSQ 96 system (Pyrosequencing, Uppsala, Sweden) and an single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) reagent kit (Pyrose-

Statistical analysis

The (cid:1)2 test was performed between centenarians and control subjects for each allelic and haplotype frequency. Statistical significance was inferred at P<0.05. Pairwise linkage disequilib- rium (LD) was estimated as D=x (cid:2)p p , where x is the frequency of ij i j ij haplotype A B , and p and p are the frequencies of alleles A and 1 1 1 2 1 B at loci A and B, respectively. A standardized LD coefficient, r, 1 is given by D/(p p q q ) where q and q are the frequencies of the 1 2 1 2 1 2 other alleles at loci A and B, respectively. Haplotype frequencies for multiple loci were estimated by the expectation-maximization method. Computations were performed using the SNPAlyze software (Dynacom, Mobara, Japan).

Discussion

central role in controlling the oxidative stress response and aging, we investigated the possible association of SHC1 genetic variability with longevity in the Japanese popula- tion. We first investigated molecular variants in the 10-kb genomic region that contains the entire SHC1 gene (Fig. 1, Table 2). Among 12 SNPs identified in this study three were nonsynonymous sites. Although the frequency of these nonsynonymous SNPs was very small, their presence is likely to affect protein function. In particular, the A205V substitution occurs within a conserved phosphotyrosine- binding domain. The frequency of the other observed SNPs is also low, which reduces the statistical power to detect population differences at this locus. Ventura et al. [17] showed that p66shc expression in primary, immortal, and transformed human cells is regulated by the degree of methylation of its promoter. Accordingly, we sequenced 1 kb of the SHC1 promoter region; however, no variation was found among centenarians or controls.

somes analyzed, despite a reported frequency of 4% in the white population [15]. Homozygotes for SNP2, SNP3, and SNP4 were identified only among the younger controls. The other polymorphisms showed no significant difference in distribution between centenarians and con- trols. For each polymorphism the major allele showed a high frequency (>95%; Table 3). The genotype frequen- cies within our sample fitted Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations with remarkable fidelity (data not shown).

Pairwise LD and haplotype analysis for SHC1

Estimation of the strength of pairwise LD allows detec- tion of risk variants by analyzing associated markers in LD. The r2 value is used in LD analyses because the power to detect a risk variant indirectly in n samples is equivalent to the power to detect it directly in nr2 samples [16]. The strength of LD for each pair of SNPs was measured using the r2 value for a total of 410 (230 centenarians and 180 controls) sets of genotypes. Figure 2 shows pairwise r2 values (1–0.9, blackened boxes) for assessment of patterns of significant disequilibrium values. Only two SNP pairs, SNP2/SNP3, and SNP6/

Association analyses were then performed using allelic and haplotype frequencies of observed SNPs in centenar- ians and control samples (Tables 3, 4). Although not statistically significant, we found some notable differ- ences in SHC1 between centenarians and younger controls. SNP8, with a reported frequency of 4% in the white population [15] was observed only in centenarians.

On the other hand, homozygotes for the minor allele of SNP2, SNP3, and SNP4 were found only among the younger controls. The frequency of the major haplotype is similar between centenarians and controls. A recently developed mathematical model suggests that centenarians show greater heterozygosity for stress-responder genes that drive the individual adaptive capacity than younger subjects [18]. Our data do not support this model, probably because SHC1 is not one of the genes affecting such adaptive capability.

While examining for differences between centenarians and controls, we found an interesting feature of SHC1. In our analysis the major allele showed a high frequency (>95%) in each polymorphism. Consequently the fre- quency of the major haplotype was also significantly high. In a recent study in which 50 genes were scanned across regions totaling 564 kb common SNPs, defined as ones with minor allele frequencies greater than 10%, were observed at a rate of one per 506 bp [19]. In our study no common SNPs were observed across the 10 kb region that comprised the SHC1 locus.

was unique for the Japanese population we additionally sequenced the same locus in samples from 24 African- Americans and 24 whites. This confirmed that this is indeed a characteristic of the SHC1 gene (data not shown), raising the possibility that this locus has been highly protected against mutations or highly preserved by natural selection throughout human evolution.

Although numerous studies have investigated the role of SHC1 as an adaptor protein functioning in the regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis, few studies have focused on the associations between variations in the SHC1 locus and age-related disease in humans. Almind et al. [15] identified a M300V substitution in SHC1 and looked for any associations with birth weight, insulin sensitivity, or prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. No such associa- tions were found. In our thorough investigation of the SHC1 locus in the Japanese population we found no significant association between allelotypes, genotypes, or haplotypes and longevity. However, we uncovered a unique feature of the SHC1 locus, which is monopolized by one major haplotype in the Japanese population. Further study is needed to elucidate the relationship between the characteristics of SHC1 and human longevity.

In light of the recent progress in understanding the biomedical significance of SHC1 the SNPs documented here will be useful not only for studying associations between specific SNPs and SHC1-related diseases but also as a catalogue of SNPs among Japanese centenarians.
