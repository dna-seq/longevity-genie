SIRT3 investigates whether variants within the gene are associated with human longevity. We analyzed 549 genomic DNA samples collected during the prospective study Treviso Longeva, including elderly individuals over 70 years of age from the municipality of Treviso, a small city in the northeast of Italy. 

Abstract 

Human sirtuins are a group of seven proteins with deacetylase activity that are emerging as key modulators of basic physiological functions. Some evidence links SIRT3 to longevity in mammals. This study aimed to investigate whether variants within the SIRT3 gene were associated with human longevity.

Background 

Human sirtuins are a group of seven proteins sharing NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity that seem to be involved in several basic physiological mechanisms and relevant for age-linked diseases (Albani et al. 2010; Polito et al. 2010). Among SIRTs, SIRT3 is a mitochondrial protein involved in defensive mechanisms against oxidative stress (Yu et al. 2012; Bause and Haigis 2012; Iwahara et al. 2012). Considering that oxidative stress is a basic feature of aging, SIRT3 may have a role in modulating longevity, a hypothesis supported by evidence in an animal model where the disruption of the gene coding for angiotensin II receptor type 1A resulted in marked prolongation of lifespan in mice, with an increased number of mitochondria in the kidney and upregulation of prosurvival genes (including SIRT3) (Benigni et al. 2009). Moreover, genetic association studies pointed out a role for SIRT3 in human longevity. The SIRT3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11555236 minor allele (T) increased male survival in an Italian cohort from Calabria and was found in linkage disequilibrium with a putative enhancer located within SIRT3 intron 5 (Bellizzi et al. 2005; Rose et al. 2003). In a different multicentre study that recruited centenarians from Italy and Germany (for a total of 1,321 centenarians and 1,140 younger subjects), some SNPs in SIRT3 showed significant association with longevity in the Italian female and in the German male subgroups, although this result was not supported by a replication enrolling centenarians of French ancestry (Lescai et al. 2009). Moreover, in a study analyzing genetic variants of the oldest old, a list of SIRT3 SNPs was detailed in long-living individuals of Caucasian ancestry (Halaschek-Wiener et al. 2009). Starting from the evidence supporting an involvement of SIRT3 in longevity, we genotyped three SNPs of SIRT3 in an ongoing prospective study enrolling an elderly population (Treviso Longeva (TRELONG) study; GallucciDeparture from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed in the considered groups, even after gender stratification (data not shown). Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model. The proportional hazard was tested using Schoenfeld's residual test, and it was never rejected, thus confirming the suitability of the model. Multivariate regression analysis was performed considering mortality as the dependent variable. These statistical analyses were computed using the survival package of the R software. After correction for possible confounders (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cerebral vasculopathies, cancer, cholesterol level, scholarship, age, and gender), results were considered significant at <0.05, using two-tailed tests of significance.

Prospective analysis of the TRELONG study features a longitudinal follow-up with mortality data. We decided to reanalyze variability considering mortality as a dependent variable and plotting survival curves according to genotype (Fig. 1). As mortality might be influenced by several other variables, we controlled for TRELONG disorders (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, vasculopathies, and cancer), risk factors (cholesterol level, scholarship), age, and gender. We found an association between rs4980329 and survival, with the allele (A) giving an advantage for longevity. HRs, considering the major allele homozygous genotype as reference, were 1.08 and 0.66 for (GA) and (AA) genotypes, respectively. A second association was found for rs11555236, with the minor allele (T) giving an advantage. For this polymorphism, HRs using the major allele homozygous genotype were 1.18 and 0.58, respectively. No association was found for rs3825075.

To investigate whether these associations had a different outcome in males or females, we performed a gender-stratified analysis, correcting for the other variables influencing survival. Plots of the TRELONG population according to genotype are shown in Fig. 2. We found a significant effect of rs4980329 and rs11555236 minor alleles for females (corrected p-values and HR: value, 0.02; HR, 0.27, respectively), while the association was no longer present in males (corrected p-values, 0.96 and 0.52, respectively).

We started evaluating the correlation of rs3825075, rs4980329, and rs11555236 with longevity by splitting the TRELONG population around 85 years of age, based on previous evidence from the same study (Albani et al. 2009, 2011). Results of this analysis are reported in Table 1. Each SNP was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (p=0.82, 0.71, and 0.93 for 2 tests assessing departure from HWE, respectively). Genotypic and allelic frequencies did not differ between age groups.

As it was hypothesized that rs11555236 might be a genetic marker of longevity in linkage disequilibrium with a putative functional enhancer within intron 5 of SIRT3 (Bellizzi et al. 2005), we decided to assess whether the rs11555236 genotype correlated with SIRT3 modulation of expression level. We focused on the SIRT3 isoform having a molecular weight of around 30 kDa that is considered the fully active protein relevant for mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis (Hallows et al. 2008). We analyzed SIRT3 protein level by Western blotting in PBMCs from the TRELONG population, building up three groups (=10 subjects each) balanced for age and gender, stratified according to rs11555236 genotype (GG, GT, or TT). Figure 3 shows SIRT3 protein immunoreactivity and the densitometric quantification. In the group homozygous for the rs11555236 minor allele (T), SIRT3 reactivity was significantly enhanced in comparison to the (GG) carriers, using α-tubulin as a normalization internal control. The normalized mean densitometric values for the three groups were as follows: (GG)=0.710±0.08; (GT)=0.80±0.4; and (TT)=1.11±0.3. These values fitted an additive model of allelic effect (linear correlation coefficient r2=0.892).

In the longitudinal survival analysis of the TRELONG population after gender stratification (Fig. 4), survival curves were plotted according to genotype and gender to search for a gender-specific effect of the investigated SIRT3 SNPs. The reported p-values are corrected for potential confounders (age, cholesterol level, scholarship, cardiovascular disease, vascular cerebropathies, diabetes, and cancer).

Significant association was found between rs4980329 and whole population survival, with a gender effect significant in women only. Importantly, we also observed a parallelism between the results of rs4980329 and rs11555236 as expected due to the predicted location of these SNPs in a linkage block according to the available HapMap (www.hapmap.org) (see Fig. 1). Our experiment allows for the consideration of these SNPs as an alternative to be genotyped in association with longevity. The fact that these polymorphisms were associated with survival in the whole population but only in females under gender stratification might tune down their effect on survival, but we and others have already seen several cases of analogous outcomes after stratification (Albani et al. 2009; Napolioni et al. 2011; Anselmi et al. 2009; Cederholm et al.). SIRT3 is linked to increased survival at oldest ages (Tazearslan et al. 2012). This gene deserves attention both for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, a fundamental aspect of cell physiology, and for the available data associating it with survival in animal models or in the elderly (Benigni et al. 2009; Halaschek-Wiener et al. 2009; Rose et al. 2003; Bellizzi et al. 2005). We analyzed an informative set of SNPs of the SIRT3 gene in a prospective study (TRELONG) allowing us to have access to survival data over a 7-year follow-up. This work was carried out on a unique group of subjects: a community-based population with the highest longevity rates in Italy (Gallucci et al. 2007). Therefore, our analysis closely reflects the correlation between SIRT3 and longevity in the Italian population in the real world. As in a previous genetic study performed in our laboratory where we had already investigated a panel of SNPs (Polito et al. 2013), we decided to select from this panel those SNPs matching or tagging a list of genetic variants whose presence was highlighted in a population of Caucasian elderly, suggesting their involvement in a prosurvival background (Halaschek-Wiener et al. 2009). Thanks to the existence of linkage disequilibrium blocks within SIRT3, we were able to choose a couple of SNPs from Polito et al. (2012) (rs3825075 and rs4980329) that were linked to the SNPs rs511744 and rs11246020 reported by Halaschek-Wiener et al. (2009; Fig. 1). The third SNP, rs11555236, was linked to longevity in an Italian study and was supposed to be in linkage disequilibrium with a putative functional enhancer (a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) element) located within intron 5 (Bellizzi et al. 2005). The cross-sectional association study was performed by splitting the TRELONG population around 85 years, a critical point discriminating long-living individuals that has allowed us to find other informative genetic variability in the same population (Albani et al. 2009). However, no association was found with this experimental design. To reanalyze data taking into account the real survival curve of each subject, a prospective analysis was conducted by inputting mortality data of the TRELONG study over a 7-year follow-up. The main result was the association between rs11555236 and survival. In this study, we have not assessed the putative VNTR enhancer element of the SIRT3 gene described by Bellizzi et al. (2005). Still, taking advantage of its reported linkage disequilibrium with rs11555236, we decided to investigate further the functional action of the VNTR element in a group of TRELONG subjects bearing the rs11555236 variants. We hypothesized that some sequences of the cis SIRT3 VNTR element acted as an enhancer on the gene, leading to an increase in SIRT3 protein levels. We verified this by measuring SIRT3 protein expression in PBMCs, as this was the only available tissue specimen from the TRELONG study. Our observation that the (T) allele, which correlated with longevity, was also associated with an increased level of SIRT3 protein is intriguing, as it might suggest that increased SIRT3 levels are beneficial, as expected from the current knowledge on this protein's functions, dealing with response to oxidative stress and control of the mitochondrial acetylome (Bause and Haigis 2012; Fritz et al. 2012). This study points to an involvement of SIRT3 variability in human longevity, with a particular emphasis on the role of the rs11555236 polymorphic site as aS, De Rango F, Greco V, Maggiolini M, Feraco E, Mari V, Franceschi C, Passarino G (2014) A novel NTR enhancer within the SIRT1 gene, a human homologue of SIR2, is associated with survival at oldest ages.
