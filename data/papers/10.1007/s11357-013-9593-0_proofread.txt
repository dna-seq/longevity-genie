Abstract:
The rs1333049 (G/C) polymorphism located on chromosome 9p21.3 is a candidate to influence extreme longevity owing to its association with age-related diseases, notably coronary artery disease (CAD). We compared allele/genotype distributions of rs1333049 in cases (centenarians) and controls (younger adults, without (healthy) or with CAD) in two independent cohorts: Spanish (centenarians: n=152, 128 women, age 100-111 years; healthy controls: n=343, 212 women, age <50 years; CAD controls: n=98, 32 women, age 65 years) and Japanese (centenarians: n=742, 623 women, age 100-115 years; healthy controls: n=920, 511 women, age <60 years; CAD controls: n=395, 45 women, age 65 years). The frequency of the risk C-allele tended to be lower in Spanish centenarians (47.0%) than in their healthy (52.9%, p=0.088) or CAD controls (55.1%, p=0.078), and significant differences were found in genotype distributions (p=0.034 and p=0.045), with a higher frequency of the GG genotype in cases than in both healthy and CAD controls as well as a lower proportion of the CG genotype compared with healthy controls. In the Japanese cohort, the main finding was that the frequency of the C-allele did not differ between centenarians (46.4%) and healthy controls (47.3%, p=0.602), but it was significantly lower in the former than in CAD controls (57.2%, p<0.001). Although more research is needed, the present and recent pioneer findings (Rejuvenation Res 13:23-26, 2010) suggest that the rs1333049 polymorphism could be among the genetic contributors to exceptional longevity in Southern European populations, albeit this association does not exist in the healthy (CAD-free) Japanese population.

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1333049 (G/C) located on chromosome 9p21.3, a locus outside of annotated genes that confers susceptibility to CAD and myocardial infarction as shown with recent genome-wide scanning (McPherson 2010; Palomaki et al. 2010; Samani et al. 2007; Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2007). This increased risk is independent of traditional risk factors including gender, age, obesity, smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (Schunkert et al. 2008). The C-allele (or the CC genotype) of rs1333049 has been associated with the risk or progression of CAD (Angelakopoulou et al. 2012; Bressler et al. 2010; Dandona et al. 2010; Ellis et al. 2010; Karvanen et al. 2009; McPherson 2010; Mendonca et al. 2011; Muendlein et al. 2009; O'Donnell et al. 2011; Palomaki et al. 2010; Plichart et al. 2012; Samani et al. 2009; Samani et al. 2007; Schunkert et al. 2008; Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2007), and related disease phenotypes such as myocardial infarction (Buysschaert et al. 2010; Helgadottir et al. 2007; Koch et al. 2011; Scheffold et al. 2011; Shen et al. 2008b), atherosclerosis progression (Ye et al. 2008), peripheral arterial disease (Cluett et al. 2009), atherothrombotic manifestations (Arlestig and Rantapaa-Dahlqvist 2012), abdominal aortic aneurysm (Biros et al. 2010; Bown et al. 2008; Helgadottir et al. 2008), ischemic stroke (Karvanen et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2009), vascular dementia (besides Alzheimer's disease) (Emanuele et al. 2011) or type 2 diabetes (During the years 2008 to 2010, controls with CAD (n=99) were included in the study. Inclusion criteria for this group were (1) men or women aged 65 years and (2) diagnosed with CAD. We extracted genomic DNA from the saliva samples of patients (66 men, 33 women) in the cardiology department of two Spanish hospitals (Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona and Gregorio Maran, Madrid) during the summer of 2013. Written consent was obtained from each participant in the Japanese cohort. The study protocol was approved by the corresponding institutional ethics committee (National Institute of Health and Nutrition and Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical Dental University, Japan, for controls and Keio University, Japan, for centenarians) and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for Human Research of 1974 (last modified in 2008). All study participants were of the same Asian (Japanese) descent.

In the Spanish cohort, written consent was obtained from each participant. The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Universidad Europea de Madrid, Spain) and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for Human Research of 1974 (last modified in 2008). All study participants were of the same Caucasian (Spanish) descent for three or more generations; the majority (~90%) of them were born and lived most of their lives in the same areas of Spain (Meseta Castellana, ~600 m altitude).

The Japanese cohort of cases was gathered from two prospective cohorts: the Tokyo Centenarians Study (TCS) and the Semi-Supercentenarians Study in Japan (SSC-J). A detailed description of population-based recruitments for the TCS has been previously reported (Gondo et al.). Cases (centenarians, n=175) were obtained from saliva samples during 2009 to 2012. The SSC-J is a nationwide longitudinal survey mainly consisting of individuals aged 105 years or older, which started in 2002. In 2002, we recruited 135 SSC in whole Japan. After 2002, our recruitment strategy has relied on responses to local governments and nursing homes in the whole country and direct inquiries to our research team. Consequently, a total of 450 centenarians (58 men, 392 women) were enrolled into SSC-J by the end of November 2011.

Genotyping was performed in the genomics laboratory of Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) during the summer and autumn of 2012 (centenarians and healthy controls) and summer of 2013 (CAD controls) for the Spanish cohort. The two experienced researchers in charge of genotyping were totally blinded to the participants' identities. Saliva samples were tracked solely with barcoding, and personal identities were only made available to the main study researcher who was not involved in actual genotyping. We used the classical phenol-chloroform DNA extraction protocol with alcoholic precipitation. Genomic DNA was resuspended in 50 μl milli-Q HO2 and stored at -20°C. We used custom-designed Taqman SNP genotyping assays (assay ID C_1754666_10) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All samples were run in a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The analysis had a pre-read and post-read step of the plate consisting of 1 min at 60°C before and after the PCR cycle. The cycle conditions were 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 92°C, and 1 min at 60°C. To ensure proper internal control, for each genotype analysis, we used positive and negative controls from different DNA aliquots which were previously genotyped by the same method.

For healthy and CAD controls gathered from the Department of Molecular Pathogenesis (Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan), venous blood samples and Taqman SNP genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were also used for rs1333049 genotyping in PCR products with the primer pairs rs1333049-F (5'-CCTTCATGCTATT  TTGAGGAG) and rs1333049-R (5'-GGAGATAAGT TGAGAATGTCA) (Hinohara et al.). The main finding was that the frequency of the C-allele tended to be lower in PP cases than in healthy (=0.088) or CAD controls (=0.078), and significant differences were found in PP genotype distributions (=0.034 and =0.045), with a higher frequency of the GG genotype in cases than in both healthy and CAD controls and a lower proportion of the CG genotype in cases compared with healthy controls. On the other hand, allele andA cohort of Japanese individuals, comprising 49.1% (Hiura et al. 2008), was studied to determine allele/genotype distributions. Table 1 presents the distributions of alleles and genotypes in the three Japanese groups. The study found that P allele (=0.602) and genotype frequencies were similar in cases and healthy controls (=0.554). However, there were significant differences in allele and genotype distributions between cases and CAD controls (both <0.001), with the high-risk C-allele and CC genotype being less frequent and the low-risk GG genotype more frequent in the former. On the other hand, allele and genotype distributions did not differ between centenarians with CAD and/or dementia compared to those without these two conditions (Table 2). Similarly, allele (=0.251) and genotype distributions (=0.188) did not differ between TCS and SSC-J centenarians subgroups (TCS: CC=25.9%, CG=47.2%, GG=26.9%; SSC-J: CC=20.0%, CG=52.5%, GG=27.5%). Table 3 shows the results of logistic regression.

The failure rate of genotyping (due to insufficient DNA) was 13.1% in cases and 5.2% and 1.01% in healthy and CAD controls, respectively. Thus, the final number of cases, healthy controls, and CAD controls entered into the analyses were n=152 (24 men, 128 women), n=343 (131 men, 212 women), and n=98 (66 men, 32 women), respectively.

Genotype distributions of rs1333049 met Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in the two control groups (>0.05), but not in the cases group (<0.05). The frequency of the risk C-allele found in healthy controls (52.9%) was similar to that previously reported in other Southern European control cohorts. In our cohort of centenarians, most of whom were not disease-free, the frequency of the C-allele (47.0%) was similar to that recently reported (46.3%) in 80 super-healthy Italian centenarians (men and women, 100-105 years) by Emanuele et al. (2010).

Our main finding was that the risk C-allele of the rs1333049 (G/C) SNP located on chromosome 9p21.3 was associated with exceptional longevity in the Spanish cohort studied, with a trend towards this association in this population segment. The major strengths of our study were the clear definition used for the criterion of exceptional longevity (with all cases being centenarians or semi-supercentenarians) and that the analyses were performed in two totally independent cohorts from both ethnic and geographic perspectives.

There is evidence indicating an association, especially in Caucasian cohorts, of the rs1333049 SNP studied here and risk of CAD and vascular dementia (besides Alzheimer's disease), with the C-allele exerting an unfavorable effect. The rs1333049 SNP has been linked with CAD-related phenotypes in non-Caucasian cohorts, especially with myocardial infarction in Japanese people, with a frequency of the risk C-allele of 52.8% in 589 individuals who had suffered myocardial infarction (Hiura et al. 2008). Further, the C-allele was recently associated with excess mortality independent of CAD risk factors in individuals aged 71 years or older.(Dutta et al., 2011). In summary, our data overall replicate and extend the original data by Emanuele et al. (2010) in suggesting that the rs1333049 (G/C) polymorphism in chromosome 9p21.3 could be among the numerous variants contributing to exceptional longevity in Mediterranean (Southern European) cohorts. However, this association was not replicated in the healthy Japanese population, and further corroboration is needed in other ethnic/geographic groups worldwide.

The genotype distribution of Spanish centenarians vs. their healthy (CAD-free) controls suggests that the potential influence of the rs1333049 SNP on exceptional longevity goes beyond its documented influence on CAD. With regards to this, although the functional significance of the rs1333049 SNP remains unclear, and the 9p21.3 locus does not contain any known expressed gene products, it lies adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, two important cell cycle regulators that are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes regulating the G1 phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases. This raises the possibility that rs1333049 may modulate the rate of cellular aging (Emanuele et al., 2010). In fact, recent genomewide scanning has suggested an association between CDKN2A/CDKN2B and extreme longevity, and CDKN2A performs a key step in the p53 pathway, which plays a crucial role in inducing cellular senescence (Sebastiani et al., 2012).
