out following the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the ethics committees of the participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their legal representatives.

We compared the allele/genotype distributions of the exonic MSTN variants K153R (rs1805086), E164K (rs35781413), I225T, and P198A in Spanish centenarians (cases, n=156; 132 women, age range 100-111 years) and younger adults (controls, n=384; 167 women, age <50 years). No subject in either group carried a mutant allele of E164K, I225T or P198A. The frequency of the variant R allele was significantly higher in centenarians (7.1%) than in controls (2.7%) (P=0.001). The odds ratio of being a centenarian if the subject had the R allele was 3.48 (95% confidence interval 1.67-7.28, P=0.001), compared to the control group after adjusting for sex. The results were replicated in an Italian cohort (centenarians, n=79 (40 women), age range 100-104 years; younger controls, n=316 (155 women), age <50 years), where a higher frequency of the R allele in centenarians (7.6%) compared to controls (3.0%) (P=0.004) was independently confirmed.

Myostatin inhibitors, such as MYO-029, have an adequate safety margin and are able to improve muscle strength/function or muscle contractile properties in some patients with muscular dystrophy (Krivickas et al., 2009; Wagner et al., 2008). Of the identified MSTN variations in humans, the Lys(K)153Arg(R) polymorphism located in exon 2 (rs1805086, 2379 A>G replacement) is one candidate to influence skeletal muscle phenotypes (Ferrell et al., 1999). The Lys(K)153Arg(R) amino acid replacement is found within the active mature peptide of the myostatin protein. It could influence proteolytic processing with its pro-peptide or affinity to bind with the extracellular activin type II receptor (ActRIIB). The MSTN K153R polymorphism is thus a candidate to influence skeletal muscle phenotypes, including in older people.

One of the most robust and well-studied improvements in longevity is caused by starvation and genetic down-regulation of a nutrient-sensing pathway, namely mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Fontana et al., 2010; Kenyon, 2010). The mTOR pathway is an evolutionarily conserved nutrient-sensing pathway that adjusts metabolism and growth to amino acid availability, growth factors, energy status, and stress (Fenton and Gout, 2011; Sengupta et al., 2010). A number of studies have demonstrated that myostatin acts as a negative regulator of mTOR-directed signaling (Amirouche et al., 2009; Langley et al., 2002; Lipina et al., 2010; McFarlane et al., 2006; Rios et al., 2004; Sartori et al., 2009; Trendelenburg et al., 2009), which provides support for a potential role of myostatin inhibition in longevity. Myostatin deletion is beneficial for bone density, insulin sensitivity, and heart function in senescent mice (Morissette et al., 2009). Inhibition of the myostatin receptor ActRIIB increased survival (by 17%) in myotubularin-deficient mice (Lawlor et al., 2011). An extension of lifespan (+30%) was also observed after therapy with follistatin (a natural antagonist of myostatin) in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (Rose et al., 2009).

Human lifespan is a partly heritable phenotype, with some alleles contributing to longevity assurance because they enhance the structure and function of the organism (Martin et al., 2007). As we age, we inevitably experience age-associated declines in the systems and organs that determine physical fitness, notably in the skeletal muscle tissue, i.e. sarcopenia. Accelerated age loss of muscle strength is associated with higher mortality risk (Metter et al., 2004; Ruiz et al., 2008); as such, genes potentially associated with higher preservation of muscle function at late life could be associated not only with healthy aging and lower disability risk but also with longevity. One such candidate is the myostatin (MSTN or growth differentiation factor 8) gene (Huygens et al., 2004).

Myostatin is a skeletal muscle-specific secreted peptide that modadult controls. The study followed the recommendations for human genotype-phenotype association studies recently published by the NCI-NHGRI Working Group on Replication in Association Studies (Chanock et al. 2007). One of the recommendations was to specify the time period and location of subject recruitment, success rate for DNA acquisition, sample tracking methods, and genotyping with a second technology in a second laboratory. 

The study investigated two groups of Italian subjects born and living in Northern Italy: 79 healthy centenarians (40 women, 39 men; age range 100-104 years) and a control group of 316 healthy young subjects aged <50 years (165 women, 151 men; age range 28-50 years). Participants' ages were defined by the dates of birth as stated on identity cards. All patients and controls in the Italian cohort were Caucasian whites of Italian descent. The criterion for Italian descent was met when an individual's parents and four grandparents originated from Italy.

The history of past and current diseases was accurately collected by checking the centenarians' medical documentation and the current drug therapy. Italian centenarians did not have major age-related diseases like severe cognitive impairment, clinically evident cancer, ischemic heart disease, renal insufficiency, or severe physical impairment, although part of this group had decreased cognitive and physical function.

Written consent was obtained from each participant, and the study protocol was approved by the corresponding institutional ethics committees (European University of Madrid, Spain, and University of Pavia, Italy). The protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for Human Research of 1974 (last modified in 2000).

In order to ensure external validity of genotyping methods, a subset of polymorphisms/samples was corroborated in a second laboratory using a different method (Chanock et al. 2007). As such, genotyping (polymorphisms K153R and E164K) of the samples of 134 centenarians (78% of total) was also performed in the genomics laboratory of Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) during the spring of 2012 using a different methodology, i.e. custom-designed Taqman SNP genotyping assays (assay ID: C___282184_30 for the K153R variant and assay ID: C__57828961_10 for the E164K variant) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All samples were run in a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The analysis had pre-read and post-read steps of the plate consisting of 1 min at 60°C before and after the PCR cycle. The cycle conditions were 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 92°C and 1 min at 60°C.

Genotyping in the Spanish cohort was performed specifically for research purposes. The researchers in charge of genotyping were blinded to the participants' identities. Saliva samples were tracked solely with barcoding, and personal identities were only made available to the main study researcher who was not involved in actual genotyping. In all participants, genomic DNA was extracted from saliva samples using the classical phenol-chloroform DNA extraction protocol with alcoholic precipitation. Genomic DNA was suspended in 50 μl Milli-Q H2O and stored at -20°C.

In all samples (from both cases and controls groups), sequences corresponding to the E164K, I225T, K153R and P198A variants were amplified during 2009-2012 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the Genetics Laboratory of the European University of Madrid (Spain). The resulting PCR products were genotyped by single-base extension (SBE) (Gonzalez-Freire et al. 2010). The primers used for E164K, I225T, K153R, and P198A were 5'-GAAAACCCAAATGTTGCTTC-3' and 5'-TGTCTAGCTTATGAGCTTAGGG-3'. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min; 35 cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 52°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.

In the Italian cohort, genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood samples using the QiaAmp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In order to obtain unlimited quantities of centenarians' DNA for different genotyping projects, an in vitro immortalization of genomic DNA was performed by means of whole-genome amplification using a commercially available kit (GenomiPhi, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ,Controls. The genotype distributions of the MSTN K153R polymorphism met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the control (P=0.168) and the centenarian groups (P=0.465). Figures 1 and 2 show the MSTN K153R allele and genotype frequencies, respectively, in the two study groups. In keeping with the results obtained in the Spanish cohort, the frequency of the R allele in Italian controls (3.0%) was also similar to that previously reported in European Caucasians. The frequency of the variant R allele and R allele carriers was significantly higher in centenarians (7.6% and 15.2%) than in controls (3.0% and 5.7%) (χ²=8.116, P=0.004 and χ²=7.059, P=0.008, respectively). No participant had the very rare RR genotype except one participant in the control group. The sex-adjusted OR of being an Italian centenarian if the subject had the R allele was 2.44 (95% CI 1.19-5.21, P=0.031), compared to the control group.

Results: Spanish cohort
The median (min, max) of the Barthel score in the centenarians group was 15 (0, 100), whereas the mean ± SD (min, max) of MMSE was 13±10 (0, 32). Approximately 13% of the centenarians were virtually independent during daily living without assistance from other persons; i.e., their Barthel score was 80 and their score in MMSE was >23 (Christensen et al., 2008). The highest Barthel and MMSE scores (95 and 28, respectively) corresponded to an individual aged 102 years.

Failure rate of genotyping (due in all cases to insufficient amount of DNA) was 3 of 387 (0.78%) in controls and 16 of 172 (9.3%) in centenarians with the SBE method (European University of Madrid) and 17 of 134 (12.7%) with the Taqman method (Vall d'Hebron Hospital). Successfully genotyped samples of centenarians showed 100% concordant results between the two laboratories. No subject carried a mutant allele of the E164K (rs35781413), I225T, and P198A variations.

Statistical power
Based on the observed prevalence of the R allele of the K153R polymorphism in the combined cohorts (Spanish and Italian subjects), our sample size had an 80% power to detect an OR of 1.92 for being a centenarian between R allele carriers and non-carriers with a significance level (α) of 0.05. Hence, the power calculations in the whole study sample imply that our data would have been sufficient to detect moderate (OR of 1.5-2.3) differences in allele and genotype frequencies between centenarians and controls.

Genotype distributions of the MSTN K153R polymorphism met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the control (P=0.581) and the centenarian groups (P=0.135). Figures 1 and 2 show the MSTN K153R allele and genotype frequencies, respectively, in the two study groups. The frequency of the R allele in the Spanish controls (~3%) was similar to that previously reported in European Caucasians, i.e., 3-4%, with a frequency of mutant homozygotes (RR) below 1% (Corsi et al., 2002; Ferrell et al., 1999; Kostek et al., 2009). The frequency of the variant R allele and R allele carriers was significantly higher in centenarians (7.1% and 12.8%) than in controls (2.7% and 5.5%) (χ²=10.815, P=0.001 and χ²=8.546, P=0.003).

Discussion
Our main finding was that the variant R allele of the MSTN K153R polymorphism is associated with exceptional longevity in the two independent cohorts we studied, with a significantly higher proportion of this allele in centenarians than in controls. In fact, the frequency of the R allele in our centenarians (7.1% in Spaniards and 7.6% in Italians) was approximately twofold higher than that previously reported in the literature for European Caucasians, i.e., 3-4% (Corsi et al., 2002; Ferrell et al., 1999; Kostek et al., 2009). Despite the complexity of the ageing process and the fact that exceptional longevity is likely a poly(Lawlor et al., 2011) X-linked myotubular myopathy is a severe form of congenital myopathy that often manifests with severe perinatal weakness and respiratory failure. An extension of lifespan (+30%) was also observed after therapy with follistatin (a natural antagonist of myostatin) in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (Rose et al., 2009). Variants of the MSTN gene are associated with muscle hypertrophy phenotypes in a range of mammalian species (Grobet et al., 1997; McPherron et al., 1997; McPherron and Lee, 1997; Mosher et al., 2007). Myostatin expression increases might contribute to muscle wasting, as suggested by research in animal models such as immobilized mice (Carlson et al., 1999) and human models such as HIV infection (Gonzalez-Cadavid et al., 1998), critical illness (Constantin et al., 2011), or cachexia (Dasarathy et al., 2004). One study showed that serum myostatin levels increased with age, suggesting an association between myostatin and age-associated sarcopenia (Yarasheski et al., 2002). However, others have shown that myostatin expression does not increase (Kawada et al., 2001; Welle et al., 2002) and can even decrease (Baumann et al., 2003) in aging-induced sarcopenia in humans or rodents, thus questioning its involvement in muscle mass wasting during aging. In fact, the R allele has not been associated with higher muscle mass/function in old Caucasian people (aged <80 years) (see Garatachea and Luca (2013) for a review). Carriage of one R allele does not seem to exert a major influence on the muscle phenotypes of nonagenarians (Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2010), whereas, surprisingly, the only two reported Caucasian old people with the RR genotype (i.e., a Spanish woman aged 96 years and an Italian person with assumed age <80 years) seemed to have lower muscle strength than their age-matched peers (Corsi et al., 2002; Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2010). Nonetheless, given the low frequency of the R allele, further research with larger population samples is needed. In summary, the variant R allele of the MSTN K153R polymorphism was significantly more frequent in centenarians than in the control group. Although more research is needed, this genetic variation could be a potential contributor to exceptional longevity.
