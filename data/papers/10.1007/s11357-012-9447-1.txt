Abstract Successful aging (SA) is a multidimension- al phenotype involving living to older age with high physical function, preserved cognition, and continued social engagement. Several domains underlying SA are heritable, and identifying health-promoting poly- morphisms and their interactions with the environment could provide important information regarding the health of older adults. In the present study, we exam- ined 263 cognitively intact Amish individuals age 80 “ ” and older (74 SA and 189 normally aged ) all of

whom are part of a single 13-generation pedigree. A genome-wide association study of 630,309 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was per- formed and analyzed for linkage using multipoint analyses and for association using the modified quasi-likelihood score test. There was evidence for linkage on 6q25-27 near the fragile site FRA6E region with a dominant model maximum multipoint hetero- 0 geneity LOD score 3.2. The 1-LOD-down support interval for this linkage contained one SNP for which

there was regionally significant evidence of association (rs205990, p0 2.36×10−5). This marker survived interval-wide Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and was located between the genes QKI and PDE10A. Other areas of chromosome 6q25- q27 (including the FRA6E region) contained sev- 0 eral SNPs associated with SA (minimum p 2.89× 10−6). These findings suggest potentially novel genes in the 6q25-q27 region linked and associat- ed with SA in the Amish; however, these findings should be verified in an independent replication cohort.

Previous genetic studies of SA have focused on three primary categories of genes selected primarily for their relevance to aging-associated pathophysio- logical processes or processes that are known to change during the aging process (Glatt et al. 2007). These categories include: (1) genes involved in the maintenance of cholesterol, lipid, and/or lipoproteins (Arking et al. 2005; Cellini et al. 2005; Taioli et al. 2001); (2) genes that influence inflammation and im- mune response, particularly cytokines, many of which also influence cell cycling, growing, motility, and signaling (Capurso et al. 2004; Naumova et al. 2004); and (3) genes involved in drug metabolism (Taioli et al. 2001). To date, few of the candidate genes associated with SA have been successfully replicated, with the exception of a few studies that have associated with longevity but not SA (Atzmon et al. 2009a; Banasik et al. 2011; Chung et al. 2010; Deelen et al. 2011; Kleindorp et al. 2011; Li et al. 2009; Nebel et al. 2011; Snejdrlova et al. 2011), suggesting that this approach may not be the best for a complex trait such as SA.

Introduction

With the rapid expansion of the population over age 60, understanding the components of successful aging (SA) is becoming a critical component of the medical and public health response to this demographic shift. The number of adults over age 60 is predicted to reach two billion worldwide by the year 2050, more than doubling from 2000 (US Census Bureau Population Division and Housing and Household Economic Sta- tistics Division 2001). This growing elderly popula- tion could dramatically impact our health care system depending on how successfully this population ages with regard to multiple factors such as physical, men- tal, and social well-being. Surprisingly, a large propor- tion of older adults has continued to function at a high “ ” level and has aged successfully (Depp and Jeste 2006). Understanding why some individuals avoid significant decline in physical function and suscepti- bility to age-related diseases might help guide clinical care and provide the basis for novel programs to prevent or slow such declines.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) avoid choosing specific candidate genes in favor of broadly surveying common variation across the entire genome. Two GWAS for extreme longevity (living past age 90 (Newman et al. 2010) and living past age 100) have recently been published, and three other GWAS, one for healthy cognitive aging past age 85 (Poduslo et al. 2009), one for disease-free survival after age 65 (Lunetta et al. 2007), and one for survival of 89 years for men and 91 years for women (Deelen et al. 2011) have also been published. There is significant variabil- ity across studies with regard to how longevity is defined as surviving beyond a certain age and others are based on being healthy and disease free up to a certain age. This inconsistency in the definition has made it difficult to compare findings across studies. To our knowledge, a GWAS has not been performed for a dichotomous successful aging outcome defined as maintaining function in cognition, physical function, and social engagement at age 80 or older. In this report, we present a genome-wide linkage and associ- ation study examining 74 successfully aged and 189 “ ” normally aged Amish adults over age 80 living in several communities in Indiana and Ohio. Genetic

Although SA is a complex and multifactorial trait, its sub-domains (chronological age, physical function, cognitive health, and social engagement and well- being) have strong genetic components. Centenarians cluster in families and siblings of centenarians are more likely to live past 85 years than others in their birth cohorts (Perls et al. 2002). Finally, data suggest that several domains underlying SA are heritable in- cluding: longevity, grip strength, lower extremity function, and retention of cognitive ability (Carmelli

studies of population isolates such as the Amish have multiple advantages over other study designs because they represent well-ascertained multigenerational ped- igrees obtained from relatively few founders and span- ning few generations, resulting in both environmental and phenotypic homogeneity (Arcos-Burgos and Muenke 2002). The results of this study suggest that several regions of interest in the genome might harbor SA loci, with the strongest evidence implicating the FRA6E region of chromosome 6.

only exclusion criterion for the SA arm of the study was cognitive impairment (individuals screening cognitively impaired were referred to the dementia arm of the study). The recruitment and ascertainment methods for CAMP have been previously described (Pericak-Vance et al. 1996; Velez Edwards et al. 2011).

Using an all common paths query of the Anabap- tist Genealogy Database, all 263 individuals were placed in a 13-generation, 4,998 person pedigree (Agarwala et al. 2003). There is no evidence of a more recent founder effect among the SA individuals. The first individuals in this pedigree born in Indiana or Ohio were born in the 1820s, four to five generations before the oldest sampled individuals in this study.

Study population

Definition of successful aging Successful aging was defined according to tests and measurements taken at the time of baseline enrollment in the study. SA was defined as previously described (Velez Edwards et al. 2011), considering functioning in all three domains described by Rowe and Kahn (1997). The specific criteria we used are outlined in Table 1. The first requirement was survival to age 80. All individuals had to be cognitively intact (education-adjusted mod- ified mini-mental state examination (3MS) >86). If someone had an education-adjusted 3MS <87 but was determined not to be cognitively impaired after further neuropsychological testing and evaluation at a consensus conference (Hahs et al. 2006), they would be classified as SA if they met the other criteria. SA individuals did not have significant depressive

This study is a part of the larger ongoing Collaborative Aging and Memory Project (CAMP). CAMP is a multi-institutional prospective population-based study of aging and dementia in the Amish communities of Adams, Elkhart, and LaGrange counties in Indiana and Holmes County in Ohio, conducted from 2002 until the present. These communities were formed in several waves of migration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (van der Walt et al. 2005). The Amish originally emigrated from Europe to Pennsyl- vania in the 1700s, and a further westward expansion of the Amish population occurred in the early 1800s when a subset of the Pennsylvania population migrat- ed to Ohio and Indiana. A second wave of migration from Switzerland arrived in the nineteenth century, eventually settling in Adams County, Indiana, in the 1850s. Present-day Amish in Holmes County, Ohio and Elkhart and LaGrange counties, Indiana are large- ly descended from the first wave of westward immi- gration from Pennsylvania, while the Adams County, Indiana settlements are largely descended from the second wave of immigration that passed through Pennsylvania (van der Walt et al. 2005). Both sets of communities, therefore, have a degree of shared his- tory and ancestry with the Pennsylvania Amish com- munities. Written and informed consent was obtained for all participants and their legal guardians.

Table 1 Criteria to identify “successfully aged” individuals

Criteria Test/cutoff Age >80 Cognitively intact 3MS >86 (education- adjusted) No significant depressive symptoms GDS <6 “High function” self-reported measures of 0 or 1 ADL and physical function IADL scales 0 or 1 Nagi score 3 or 4 Rosow– Breslau score Lower extremity function >8 (12 pt scale) EPESE Satisfied or very satisfied with life Questionnaire

For the SA arm of the CAMP study, individuals over age 80 were identified through public directories published by individual Amish communities and re- ferral from individuals already enrolled in the study. Once individuals were identified, a door-to-door inter- view was performed for a baseline examination. The

Self-rated physical function was assessed by several well-established instruments. Basic self-care was assessed using a modified Katz ADL scale con- sisting of eight items: bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, continence, transferring, walking, and eating (Katz 1983). Difficulty with musculoskeletal function was assessed by a five-item scale based on the work of Nagi (1976) used in the EPESE (Seeman et al. 1994): pushing large objects, stoop- ing or kneeling, carrying weights over 10 lb, extending arms above shoulder level, and writing. Advanced daily living tasks were evaluated by a – three-item modified Rosow Breslau scale (Rosow and Breslau 1966) assessing difficulty performing heavy work around the house or farm, walking up and down a flight of stairs, and walking a half mile without help. A final scale assessing more integrative functions IADLs consisted of six of the eight items suggested by Lawton and Brody (1969): traveling, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework, managing medications, and handling money.

Next, we considered whether individuals met standard “ ” cutoffs for high function on the self-reported meas- ures of physical function: total scores of 0 or 1 on the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental (IADL) scales, indicating no assistance or partial as- sistance on only a single item needed; Nagi score of 0 or 1 (Nagi 1976), indicating no difficulty or difficulty – on only one item; Rosow Breslau score of 3 or 4, indicating limitation on zero items or one item. Lower extremity function was considered by limiting SA to individuals scoring in the top 1/3 of the sample on the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) short physical performance bat- tery summary score (>8 on a 12 point scale). Finally, individuals considered SA self-reported to be satisfied or very satisfied with life.

There were a total of 263 Amish individuals included in this study after performing sample qual- ity control (QC). Among these 263 individuals, 74 were classified as SA and 189 were classified as controls. This study has been reviewed and ap- proved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Miami and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

In addition to these self-reported measures of func- tioning, a short physical performance test developed for use in the EPESE was used to assess lower ex- tremity function (Seeman et al. 1994). The tasks in- clude three measures of balance (side by side, semi- tandem, and tandem) for 10 s, the time required to sit and stand from a chair five times without using the hands and the time required to walk 10 ft.

Collection of clinical and demographic data The baseline examination included collection of demo- graphic characteristics and a screening of cognitive and physical function. Demographic information and family relationships (parents and grandparents) were recorded in standard format to facilitate pedigree construction.

Genotyping

The Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix®, Inc Santa Clara, CA) was used for genome-wide SNP genotyping. DNA was obtained from the Hussman In- stitute of Human Genomics at the University of Miami and the Center for Human Genetics Research at Van- derbilt University DNA Banks. Genomic DNA was quantitated via the ND-8000 spectrophotometer, and DNA quality was evaluated via gel electrophoresis. μ The genomic DNA (250 ng/5 l) samples were pro- cessed according to standard Affymetrix procedures for processing of the assay. The arrays were then scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7 G operated by the Affymetrix® GeneChip® Command Console® soft- ware. The data were processed for genotype calling using the Affymetrix® Power Tools (APT) software using the birdseed calling algorithm version 2.0 Affy- metrix®, Inc Santa Clara, CA (Korn et al. 2008).

Participants underwent cognitive screening using a revision of the 3MS examination (Teng and Chui 1987) developed for use in the Cache County Memory Study. We established the 3MS cutoff point of <87 (after education adjustment), indicating potential cog- nitive impairment after examining the receiver operat- ing curves in predicting subsequent dementia and ’ prodromal Alzheimer s disease in the Cache County Memory Study. This cut point was selected as having maximal utility in detection of dementia (Khachaturian et al. 2000), optimizing the sensitivity of case detection (98.4 %). Depression was screened using the 15-item GDS (Yesavage 1988), and life satisfaction was “ probed using a single question: Overall how sat- isfying is your life: very satisfying, satisfying, not ” so satisfying?

Samples with call rates less than 95 % were reexamined by re-clustering analysis. The follow- ing sample QC procedures were applied: (1) one CEPH sample was placed on each plate to ensure reproducibility of results across the plates; (2) all samples with call rates <95 % were rechecked individually to ensure quality of genotypes; the DNA sample was examined using gel electropho- resis to determine the quality of the actual DNA sample before making a call to exclude it from analysis; (3) A sample call rate of 95 % was applied to all samples, if the call rate fell below this average after several chips were run, genotyp- ing was stopped, and molecular procedures and equipment were tested for potential problems.

for these same markers and were used for SNP allele frequency estimation, determining deviations from HWE, and setting linkage phase in the pedigrees.

Linkage analysis We used the software program Ped- Cut (Liu et al. 2008) to subdivide the 13 generation pedigree into computationally tractable sub-pedigrees. The 74 SA individuals and their 7 full siblings were grouped into 16 sub-pedigrees informative for linkage (e.g., at least two SA individuals in each pedigree) that ≤ were small enough (bit size 24) to generate multi- – point LOD scores using the Lander Green algorithm implemented in Merlin (Abecasis et al. 2002). PLINK was used to select a set of 4,941 markers in low linkage disequilibrium (pairwise r2<0.16 for all markers) for multipoint linkage analysis. Inter-marker map distances were obtained from the Rutgers Com- – bined Physical Linkage Map (Matise et al. 2007). Multipoint LOD scores allowing for heterogeneity (multipoint heterogeneity LOD score (MHLOD)) were calculated using affected-only dominant (trait 0 allele frequency 0.001), affected-only recessive (trait 0 allele frequency 0.20), and nonparametric allele- sharing (multipoint nonparametric allele-sharing LOD score (MLOD*)) models.

Statistical analysis

Quality control Additional sample QC was per- formed using the APT software release 1.12.0 avail- able from Affymetrix®, Inc Santa Clara, CA. Twenty- nine samples were dropped due to low contrast QC. All individuals with inconsistent genders were dropped if the inconsistency could not be resolved; this removed 20 samples. RELPAIR software (Epstein et al. 2000) was used to test for misspecification of pedigree relationships and to obtain a list of problem- atic individuals to be followed up and resolved; all misspecifications were resolved. Seven samples were dropped due to sample genotyping efficiency (<95 %).

Case control association The case control analysis of SA was performed using the modified quasi- likelihood score (MQLS) method, a quasi- likelihood score test that accounts for correlations among individuals to maintain correct type I error rates and tests for allelic association (Thornton and McPeek 2007). MQLS uses a kinship variance/ covariance matrix of inbreeding coefficients and kinship coefficients to account for inbreeding and relatedness between individuals using a specified pedigree structure. Population prevalence for SA of 30 % was specified, consistent with the frequency of SA in the current study. The method is compu- tationally tractable for GWAS. Only analyses of autosomal SNPs were performed.

dropped due to sample genotyping efficiency (<95 %). PLINK (Purcell et al. 2007) statistical software was used both for marker QC and to format data for analysis. Markers included in analyses had a minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05 and a geno- typing efficiency >95 %; this resulted in the re- moval of 221,982 markers for MAF and 30,303 markers for genotyping efficiency. Markers that did not map to a chromosome, mitochondrial SNPs, and X chromosome SNPs were also exclud- ed (23,997). A goodness of fit test was used to – examine deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilib- rium (HWE) in the most unrelated individuals (166 individuals determined by pairwise kinship coeffi- cients obtained from the KinInbcoef program (Thornton and McPeek 2007)). Markers with strong deviations from HWE (p<1.0×10−7) were removed from the analysis; this removed seven markers. Genotypes on 551 individuals generated by the CAMP dementia study were also available

lege Station, TX, 2008) was used to create summary statistics for demographic data. Generalized estimat- ing equations with an independence correlation matrix and robust standard errors were used to compare SA cases to controls for demographic data using nuclear families as the correlated grouping variable. p values are reported for demographic data analyses.

Results

dominant model at 166.19 Mb, with a 1-LOD-down support interval extending from 164.38 to 169.62 Mb. The peak MHLOD of 3.30 on chromosome 16 was obtained at 23.97 Mb under a recessive model (1-LOD-down support interval, 18.97 to 26.57 Mb). Three peaks were detected under the nonparametric model on chromosomes 10 (peak MLOD* 4.30 at 4.26 Mb, 1-LOD-down support interval 3.28 to 5.59 Mb), 17 (peak MLOD* 3.50 at 10.09 Mb, 1-LOD-down support interval 9.82 to 11.49 Mb), and 20 (peak MLOD* 3.3 at 0.93 Mb, 1-LOD-down support interval 0.58 to 4.07 Mb).

A description of the criteria used to define SA and normally aged control individuals is provided in Ta- ble 1, and a description of the study sample is provid- ed in Table 2. SA cases were slightly younger and had a higher proportion of males than the controls. A larger proportion of SA cases were from Ohio than Indiana, although a majority of participants were from Indiana. SA cases had slightly lower but not statisti- cally different mean body mass index than the control. By design, measures used to define SA (tests of cog- nitive impairment, depression, and physical impair- ment tests) were lower in SA cases than the control.

Association analysis

Multipoint linkage analysis

To assess association under linkage peaks, markers were examined for regionally significant association within the 1-LOD-down support intervals for the five multipoint linkage peaks. Only the association at inter- genic SNP rs205990 (chromosome 6, 164.44 Mb (GRCh37/hg19 build) between quaking homolog KH domain RNA binding (QKI) and phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A), p0 2.36×10−5) survived a Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs located in each 1- LOD-down confidence interval (p<2.8×10−5 on

The results of multipoint genome-wide linkage analy- sis for all chromosomes using parametric affected- only dominant, parametric affected-only recessive, and nonparametric linkage models are summarized in Fig. 1. Five regions of the genome generated multi- point LOD scores (MHLOD or MLOD*) exceeding three under at least one of the models tested. The peak MHLOD of 3.24 on chromosome 6 occurred under a

These markers were located ~60 Mb upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase, kinase 4 (MAP3K4) and downstream of plasminogen (PLG). However, there is low pairwise LD between these three associations (r2<0.01 between rs205990 and the other two blocks, r20 0.08 between the FRA6E blocks), indicating that the signals are independent.

In addition to the association mapping under link- age peaks, all genotyped SNPs were analyzed to detect any genome-wide significant associations (Bonferroni corrected p<8×10−8). Quantile– quantile (q– q) plots (Online Resource Fig. 1) demonstrated little deviation from expectations. As summarized in the Manhattan plot (Online Resource Fig. 2), no associations exceeded this threshold, but the strongest results genome-wide (p<1×10−5) are summarized in Table 3. Ten of these SNPs are in the fragile site 6 (FRA6E) region on chromosome 6 and are less than 3 Mb from the regionally significant SNP on chromosome 6 (rs205590). Eight additional SNPs were further than 3 Mb. Stratification by state of residence indicated that associations were concentrated in Amish from Ohio, consistent with linkage results in the 6q region.

Discussion

We performed a GWAS examining linkage to and association with SA in the Amish and observed sug- gestive evidence for both at intergenic SNP rs205990 on chromosome 6. This marker survived interval-wide Bonferroni correction and is located between the genes QKI and PDE10A. Neither gene has been pre- viously associated with risk for SA or any other lon- gevity or aging trait. PDE10A is involved in neurologic cascades and has been associated with schizophrenia and Huntington’ s disease (Arnaud-

Three SNPs in the FRA6E region were in a gene, Parkinson juvenile disease protein 2 (PARK2), and are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (Online Resource Fig. 3) with each other with r2 ranging from 0.86 to

complex disorders. In addition, the TSHR expression has previously associated with exceptional longevity in a previously published study of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, which may support a role for PDE10A in SA (Atzmon et al. 2009b). Although we observed strong evidence for linkage at three additional regions on chromosomes 10, 17, and 20, markers under these linkage peaks did not show individual evidence for association. This may be due to either lack of power to find association or it may be possibly due to segrega- tion of alleles in sub-pedigrees and not population- level association.

Lopez et al. 2008; Kehler 2011; Kleiman et al. 2011). A previously published genome-wide scan associating thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid levels with gene variants observed a strong association with PDE8A and PDE10A in age diverse populations (Sar- dinians, Tuscans, and Old Order Amish) (Arnaud- Lopez et al. 2008). The strongest association in this previously published study was in PDE8A; however, PDE10A is in the same enzyme family and is involved in the cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP signaling pathways. The PDE10A gene protein product has been found to be involved in the pathophysiology of human disease. TSH controls thyroid function through bind- ing of G protein coupled receptor, TSH receptor (TSHR), and cAMP production. TSH plays a role in muscle, bone, central nervous system, and heart phys- iology, and therefore may contribute to several

The SNPs with the strongest, but not genome-wide significant, evidence for association (p<1.00×10−5) were not located in genes and did not show evidence for linkage. Several of these markers are on chromo- some 6 within the FRA6E region, which is less than

3 Mb from the top linkage result. However, there is no extensive LD between SNPs in the linkage region and the FRA6E region, indicating that these asso- ciation signals might be independent. FRA6E has not been previously implicated with SA, although some studies have proposed PARK2, located with the FRA6E region, as a putative candidate for longevity and aging (Lunetta et al. 2007). The nearest neighboring genes to these markers in the FRA6E region were PLG and MAP3K4. PLG is a circulating zymogen with the primary function of dissolving fibrin (OMIM #173350). PLG is not an established candidate gene for SA but has been suggested to be involved with wasting (weight loss and poor wound healing) and decreased longevity due to disseminated fibrin deposition in animal model studies (Cheng et al. 2005). There is no established biological evidence implicating MAP3K4 with longevity or aging.

necessary to fully understand the significance of these findings.

A potential limitation to our study was the inability of MQLS to allow for covariate adjust- ment, and as a result we were unable to adjust for heterogeneity in study findings across ascertain- ment center (Ohio and Indiana). However, our linkage analyses should implicitly take care of confounding through pedigree structure. Since we looked at a consensus of results across linkage and association analyses, we believe that the results are not likely confounded by ascertainment center and merit further follow-up.

SA to chromosomes 6, 7, and 14 in a smaller subset of the sample (48 SA cases) used here (Velez Edwards et al. 2011). In the current sample of 74 SA cases, genotyped for a much denser map of markers, the strongest evidence for linkage was obtained in a different area of chromosome 6. This region, near FRA6E, did provide modest evidence 0 – for linkage (MHLOD 1.10 2.09) in our original study, indicating that the expanded sample im- proved power to detect linkage (Velez Edwards et al. 2011). The difference in evidence for linkage across the three models considered (dominant, re- cessive, and nonparametric allele-sharing) may re- flect differences in the goodness of fit for each model given different modes of inheritance. While evidence for linkage maximizes under different models for chromosome 6 (dominant), 16 (reces- sive), and 10, 17 and 20 (nonparametric), the linkage curves for the other models follow a sim- ilar pattern (nonparametric model reaches 2.5 on chromosomes 6 and 16, the dominant model peaks just under 3 on chromosome 10, and the recessive model just over 2 on chromosome 17), suggesting that these findings are fairly robust to the specifi- cation of a genetic model. A notable exception is chromosome 20, which generates much stronger linkage under nonparametric analysis than the oth- er two models (maximum MHLOD ~1 under a dominant model). We note, however, that given relatively small sample size from an isolated pop- ulation and differences in results from our previous study in this population, further replication of these results in an independent cohort is desirable. The correlation between linkage and association on chromosome 6 establishes a priority area for

We observed a higher rate of SA in males relative to females in our cohort, results that have not been observed consistently in previous litera- ture. Studies in the MacArthur Studies of Success- ful Aging observed that males were more likely to have better physical performance at baseline in a – cohort of 70 79-year olds with high function, con- sistent with our observations (Seeman et al. 1994). The studies by McLaughlin et al. of adults aged 65 and older, however observed the opposite asso- ciation between SA and gender (McLaughlin et al. 2010). A possible explanation for these differences is the definition of SA used. We attempted to use a definition as comprehensive as possible, integrat- ing factors pertaining to physical and cognitive function, social engagement, and health, whereas other studies often used only one or two of these components. Another possible explanation for the larger number of SA males relative to females could be the effect of marital status on successful aging which previously has been indicated (Li et al. 2006). Our sample also had a greater propor- tion of successfully aged men (52 % of men SA vs. 17 % of women SA) who were currently married (78 % of men currently married vs. 45 % of women currently married). The relation- ship between gender, marriage, and SA has not been consistent across studies, with the majority finding no association; however, it merits further
