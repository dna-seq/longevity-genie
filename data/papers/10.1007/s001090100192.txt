ined the effect of the PAI-1 4G/5G genotype on longevi- ty among 205 subjects aged 80 years and older. Such studies in larger cohorts have recently become available along with new methods for the rapid and easy determi- nation of gene polymorphisms. We utilized a light-cycler assisted method which is a fast and flexible method of analyzing the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism on the gene level. In these 205 persons the 4G/5G allele was found in 96 persons (47%), the 4G/4G variant in 62 (30%), and the 5G/5G allele in 47 (23%). These data are similar to the allele distribution described in other large cohorts not restricted to old age. Thus the results of this study are not suggestive of an important contribution of the PAI-1 genotype on total mortality.

Abstract Accumulating evidence suggests that plasma levels of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) may modulate the risk of coronary artery disease. The regulation of PAI-1 levels underlies not only environ- mental but also genetic influences. The 4G/5G polymor- phism of the PAI-1 gene has recently gained additional relevance as a possible cardiovascular risk factor, as the 4G allele may be associated with enhanced expression of the PAI-1 gene.

Introduction

The primary function of the plasminogen activator inhib- itor 1 (PAI-1) in vivo is to regulate fibrinolysis. There is increasing evidence that elevated levels of PAI-1 may also play a role in the development of cardiovascular dis- ease [1, 2, 3]. In this context it is interesting to note that raised PAI-1 plasma levels may be associated with a 1-bp guanine deletion/insertion (4G/5G) polymorphism in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene [4, 5]. Never- theless, studies on the significance of this polymorphism as a risk predictor in individuals with or without athero- thrombotic disease to date have revealed conflicting re- sults [6, 7, 8], with the majority of recent studies denying a correlation between the PAI-1 polymorphism and car- diovascular disease [9, 10, 11, 12]. Therefore it still re- mains unclear whether the PAI-1 polymorphism, as with some other single-nucleotide polymorphisms [13], is as-

Table 1 PCR primers and hybridization probes for the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism. The hybridization probes were constructed as pub- lished by Nauck et al. [15] (boldfaced fluorescein-labeled 5G-hybridization probe, LCR Light-Cycler red, FL fluorescein)

sociated with an increased risk in morbidity and mortali- ty. The accurate assessment of its age dependency and proportional distribution in the population could provide additional information on the (patho)physiological rele- vance of the 4G/5G polymorphism.

hybridization probe, 20 pmol of each PCR primer, 2 µl Light-Cy- cler DNA master hybridization mix (Roche), 2 µl DNA (100 pg–10 ng) in a final volume of 20 µl. After 45 s of denatur- ation at 94°C, PCR cycles were performed with 0 s denaturation at 94°C, 5 s annealing at 57°C, and 2 s extension at 72°C for 50 cy- cles. Melting curves were achieved following a denaturation peri- od of 0 s at 94°C at a start temperature of 45°C and an end tem- perature of 75°C with a temperature increase of 0.2°C/s. PCR and melting procedure were detected online with the Light-Cycler in- strument.

As PAI-1 is of biological significance in causing an elevated risk of thromboembolic disease, the determina- tion of this PAI-1 polymorphism may have important im- plications in the early detection of asymptomatic patients who have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In the present study we evaluated the 4G/5G PAI-1 polymorphism in 205 persons aged 80 years or older to evaluate whether aging is associated with the predominance of a certain PAI-1 genotype, possibly indi- cating the selection of a favorable allele.

Statistical methods

Statistical analysis of data was performed using Excel (Microsoft Office 2000). Data are expressed as a percentage of all studied in- dividuals.

Such investigations of the biological basis of human longevity have not frequently been attempted in the past because of a lack of efficient and cost-effective methods to analyze gene polymorphisms in large numbers of indi- viduals. With a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assisted approach a high throughput analysis of the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism has been made possible [15].

Results

Figure 1A presents the online fluorescence curves of the PCR amplification of the PAI-1 promoter region cover- ing the 4G/5G polymorphic site. All samples show an exponential increase in fluorescence intensity as a mea- surement for the quantity of amplified fragments. The negative PCR control remained negative. The real-time PCR-assisted analysis of the PAI-1 4G/5G polymor- phism was carried out by the online analysis of the melt- ing curves of the hybridization probes. Figure 1B shows melting curves of three samples (fluorescence over time), and Fig. 1C shows the first differentiation of the fluorescence (F) over time (T) (–dF/dT). The melting maximum of the 5G hybridization probe is 59.5°C for the 4G/4G genotype, 59.5°C and 65°C in the case of the 4G/5G genotype, and 65°C in the case of the 5G/5G gen- otype.

Materials and methods

Subjects

Blood samples from 205 white donors (147 women, 58 men; aged 80–98 years, mean 86.1) were recruited from three different homes for the aged in the city of Bonn, Germany. All volunteer subjects provided information on their medical history. Their mean body mass index was 22.6. The series included 44 current or former smokers, 39 persons with a history of myocardial infarc- tion, 36 with a history of stroke, 87 with arterial hypertension, 30 with diabetes mellitus, and 34 with malignant disease. Whole blood was collected from an antecubital vein into vacuum contain- ers, containing EDTA. Before entering the study, each subject gave informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Bonn.

The 4G/5G allele was found in 96 persons (47%), the 4G/4G variant in 62 (30%), and the 5G/5G allele in 47 (23%; Table 2).

Subgroup analysis was performed for subjects who had a history of myocardial infarction and/or a history of stroke (Table 2). Among the combined group of patients with cardiovascular disease (33.7% of the entire cohort), the allele frequencies were nearly identical to those among subjects without a history of cardiovascular dis- ease within our study group.

DNA-extraction

Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using the QiAmp Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Real-time PCR

Discussion

PCR was performed utilizing a Light-Cycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using hybridization probes in combination with the Light-Cycler DNA master hybridization probes kit (Roche, Mann- heim, Germany) as described by Nauck et al. [15]. The PCR prim- ers and the hybridization probes are shown in Table 1. The hybrid- ization probes were synthesized by TIB MOLBIOL (Berlin, Ger- many). The PCR conditions were 4 mM MgCl , 1 pmol of each 2

Several sequence variations in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene, especially the 4G/5G polymorphism, have been described [16, 17]. 4G/5G polymorphism refers to a guanosine insertion/deletion polymorphism in the pro-

moter region of the PAI-1 gene, 675 bp upstream from the start of transcription. In vitro studies suggest that the 4G allele is associated with higher PAI-1 activity than the 5G allele [18]. One possible mechanism may be de- rived from the finding that while both alleles bind a tran- scriptional activator, the 5G allele contains an additional binding site for a DNA-binding protein that could be a transcriptional repressor [18]. In the absence of bound repressor the basal level of PAI-1 transcription is in- creased [4, 18]. As gene variants of PAI-1 obviously ac- count for a significant portion of the interindividual vari- ability in circulating PAI-1 antigen concentrations in the general population [19], there is increasing interest in the determination of the genotype of PAI-1. In a large cohort of men in the United States aged 40–84 years the overall allele distribution has been reported as approximately 25% 4G/4G, 25% 5G/5G, and 50% 4G/5G genotype [20].

erence values for the distribution of the 4G/5G alleles among cohorts in the United States, Japan, and Europe. A similar pattern of distribution as shown in these stud- ies was also demonstrated in our group of 205 elderly subjects (Table 2). Subgroup analysis comparing the fre- quency of the PAI-1 4G/5G alleles between subjects with and without a history of cardiovascular disease yielded no further information as the allele frequencies among those two groups did not differ significantly (Table 2). Thus homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its associa- tion with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with reach- ing old age. This contrasts with the findings of a previ- ous study [21] which demonstrated a higher proportion of the 4G allele and the homozygous 4G/4G genotype in centenarians than in young individuals (P=0.021 and P=0.049, respectively). The latter results suggest an even better survival for individuals with the PAI-1 4G geno- type despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis. Individuals with the homozygous 4G/4G genotype did not suffer more frequently from stroke or myocardial in-

farction, which is intriguing as high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of myocardial infarction in young men [18]. Despite this fact, the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in the studied subjects who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached old age.

Nevertheless, it must be considered that the 4G allele which might be associated with higher PAI-1 serum lev- els is not necessarily a disadvantageous marker. The ac- tivity of the fibrinolytic system is reflected in circulating levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its most important inhibitor, PAI-1. Elevated t-PA antigen levels are strongly associated with elevated PAI-1 anti- gen and activity [26]. Increased levels of t-PA antigen have been shown to be a marker of risk of several thromboembolic diseases [27, 28]. The pathophysiologi- cal background of this finding is controversial; one pos- sible mechanism is the increased risk of arteriosclerotic plaque rupture under conditions of an enhanced fibrinol- ysis. Thus individuals with the 4G/4G allele may better balance increases in t-PA levels, and this could represent a possible mechanism for reduced fibrinolytic activity to be advantageous. This hypothesis is supported by evi- dence that thrombosis increases the expression and cir- culating levels of PAI-1 [29, 30].

Nevertheless, the studied groups were small both in the cited 124 centenarians and in our study of 205 elder- ly individuals. Therefore it cannot be excluded that dif- ferences between the results of these two studies are due to small numbers with the resulting statistical conse- quences. Moreover, we chose a group of of persons who were 10–20 years younger than the centenarians, and this may also have contributed to the differing results.

On the basis of the results of our own study we sus- pect that other genetic variables and environmental con- ditions may be stronger predictors of longevity than the 4G/5G PAI-1 polymorphism. However, it should be ac- knowledged that the method of investigating single gene polymorphisms may identify only genes with a mono- causal genetic impact on health risks. Multiple logistic functions linking numerous genotypical and phenotypi- cal characteristics are probably needed to determine indi- vidual risk, thus identifying high risk groups. Neverthe- less, genotyping of PAI-1 polymorphism may be useful for predicting and preventing thrombosis-related events [19, 24, 31], although, in conclusion of our study results, the 4G/5G polymorphism cannot discriminate individu- als with a high mortality risk. Our data suggest that the allele-distribution of the 4G/5G polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene is not markedly different in a cohort of per- sons 80 years or older than in several other published studies investigating other age ranges.
