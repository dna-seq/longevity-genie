Abstract Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is one of the key proteins in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). The role of CETP in atherosclerosis remains con- troversial. In this study we investigated the associations between polymorphisms of CETP (mutations in intron 14 and exon 15, and Taq1B), hepatic lipase (C-514T), li- poprotein lipase (PvuII and HindIII), and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (R219K) loci and longevity in 256 centenarians and 190 healthy younger controls. Although heterozygous CETP deficiency and the B2 allele of the Taq1B polymorphism was consistently associated with higher HDL-C concentrations both in centenarians and controls, the allelic frequencies of those polymorphisms did not differ between the two groups. The allelic fre- quencies of other gene polymorphisms in RCT were not different between the two groups. Centenarians with li- − − poprotein lipase P( / ) genotype had significantly higher − HDL-C concentration than those with P( /+) or with P(+/+), in contrast, there was no such a relationship among controls. In stepwise multiple regression analysis, serum albumin, CETP deficiency and lipoprotein lipase PvuII genotype were independently associated with HDL-C in centenarians. Sex, CETP deficiency, and the Taq1B genotype were also independently associated with HDL-C; however, lipoprotein lipase PvuII genotype had no significant effect on their HDL-C in controls. In con- clusion, we observed that CETP deficiency and other gene polymorphisms in RCT have no impact on longevi- ty for Japanese centenarians.

French [20], Finnish [21], and Japanese centenarians [23, 24, 25]. It is of interest to investigate associations be- tween CETP deficiency and longevity in Japan, where the prevalence of the deficiency is extremely high and the life expectancy is longest around the world. It is also of worth to examine the hypothesis that rather a defect of risk factor for atherosclerosis, protective factors by na- ture could be advantageous for longevity. Therefore we have examined the associations of CETP deficiency as well as other genetic polymorphisms involved in RCT and longevity in 256 Japanese centenarians and 190 younger controls.

Introduction

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has poten- tially antiatherogenic property. Numerous epidemiologi- cal studies have confirmed that a low level of HDL-C is a strong risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) [1]; however, there is evidence that not quantity but underlying mechanisms of high HDL-C levels are im- portant for preventing atherosclerosis [2, 3]. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which enhances cholesterol efflux from the arterial wall and transport to the liver for reuse or excretion into bile, has been proposed as one of possible antiatherogenic mechanism of HDL. Cholester- yl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a carrier protein in RCT, which mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipopro- teins, thus enhancing RCT. The role of CETP in athero- sclerosis remains controversial. Several mutations have been described at the CETP gene locus which cause de- pletion of CETP activity and consequently high HDL-C in plasma, especially in Japan [4, 5]. It has been demon- strated that CETP deficiency exhibits atherogeneity when combined with serum HDL-C level lower than 60 mg/dl [6] or with low activity of hepatic lipase [7]. In contrast, low CETP activity associated with the B2 allele of the Taq1B polymorphism may have protective roles against atherosclerosis [8]. Furthermore, CETP deficien- cy has been demonstrated to be associated with longevity in one study [4], and opposite result was obtained from another study [9, 10].

Methods

Subjects

A total of 256 Japanese centenarians (190 women, 66 men) living in the Tokyo metropolitan area were recruited for the second term of Tokyo Centenarian Study from April 1999 to January 2001 by using national registry of centenarians published by Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Labor. Among them, 184 centenarians were living at home, and 72 were institutionalized, but none were in acute setting nor receiving tube feeding. Evaluations included physical examination, measurement of body weight and height, blood pressure, habitual food intake, alcohol consumption, smok- ing habits, physical and cognitive function, electrocardiogram, use of medication, and past medical history [23]. Blood chemistry an- alyses included screening for liver and renal dysfunction, malnu- trition, and inflammation. Fifty-three centenarians (20.6%) were receiving antihypertensive treatment, and ten had a history of can- cer treatment (two each for stomach, colon, prostate and breast, and one each for bladder uterus cancer). None was diabetic or used lipid-lowering drugs. The regionally matched younger con- trol group consisted of 190 healthy volunteers (104 women, 86 men; mean age 40.0±11.2 years, range 22–65). They were free from diseases such as CAD, stroke, diabetes, and cancer and had either no or moderate smoking and alcohol consumption. Written informed consent was obtained form all the participants or proxy. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Keio Univer- sity School of Medicine.

In addition to CETP, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransfer- ase, hepatic lipase (HL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) are partici- pants of reverse cholesterol transport. Certain polymor- phisms of the LPL gene have been shown to be associat- ed with atherogenic lipid profiles [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], CAD [13, 14], and diabetes [13]. Common variations in the ABCA1 gene are reported to be associated with plas- ma lipids and cardiovascular risk [16, 17]. These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of those enzymes in reverse cholesterol transport could affect lipoprotein me- tabolisms and modulate risk for CAD presumably in concert with CETP. However, as far as we know, there have been a few studies that simultaneously investigate the interplay of participants in reverse cholesterol trans- port as a whole system [18, 19].

Table 1 presents the background characteristics in centenarians and controls. As previously described [23], lipid profiles in cente- narians were characterized by low levels of total cholesterol, low- density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL-C, apoA1, and apo B and by elevated lipoprotein (a) levels. The CETP concentrations in cente- narians were significantly lower than those in controls (P<0.001), which are also compatible with our previous report [23]. Body mass index and serum albumin were also lower in centenarians. In centenarians no significant sex differences were found in the mean levels of plasma lipid, serum albumin, or body mass index; ac- cordingly, the data for both sexes were combined for subsequent analysis. In contrast, women in control group had significantly higher levels of HDL-C (67±12 vs. 53±14 mg/dl, P<0.0001), apoA1 (151±18 vs. 138±17 mg/dl, P=0.0018), and CETP mass (3.9±1.0 vs. 3.5±0.7 µg/ml, P=0.014), and lower levels of triglyce- ride (76±46 vs. 139±98 mg/dl, P=0.0002 by using logarithmically transformed value), apoB (80±20 vs. 98±26 mg/dl, P<0.0001), and body mass index (20.5±2.2 vs. 23.6±3.3, P<0.0001) as com- pare to male controls.

Recently there have been many findings from narians studies that have extensively investigated the sociations between genetic predisposition for fatal ε ease and longevity [20, 21, 22, 23]. For example, the allele of the apoE gene which is related not only to an crease risk for CAD but also to the development

Promoter polymorphism of the HL gene (C-514T) were deter- mined as developed by Couture et al. [29] with following primer: 5′-TCT AGG ATC ACC TCT CAA TGG GTC A-3′ and 5′-GGT GGC TTC CAC GTG GCT GCC TAA G-3′. The PCR product was digested with 10 U NlaIII, resulting in two fragments of 215 and 70 bp for the T allele, a 285 bp for the C allele.

concentrations of total cholesterol and triglyceride were deter- mined by automated enzymatic procedures. The concentrations of HDL-C were determined after precipitation of apoB-containing li- poproteins with phosphotungstic Mg2+. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated from Friedewald formula. The concen- trations of apoA1 and apoB were determined by turbidimetric im- munoassay. The concentrations of lipoprotein(a) was measured by latex agglutination immunoassay. Plasma CETP concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a com- mercial kit [26] (CETP ELISA, Chugai, Tokyo).

The R219K polymorphism of the ABCA1 gene was recently identified by Clee et al. [16]. The PCR primer was as below: 5′- GTA TTT TTG CAA GGC TAC CAG TTA CAT TTG ACA A-3′ and 5′-GAT TGG CTT CAG GAT GTC CAT GTT GGA A-3′. PCR was conducted with denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, anneal- ing at 60°C for 1 min and primer extension at 72°C for 1.5 min for a total of 30 cycles. After digestion with EcoNI, the resulting frag- ment is 177-bp for the R allele and 107and 100 bp fragments for the K allele.

DNA mutation and polymorphism

cell by phenol extraction. CETP mutation in intron 14 (Int14A) was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method as described by Inazu et al. [4]. Briefly, genomic DNA was amplified by PCR in Program TEMP control system PC-800 (ASTEC, Fukuoka) using designed primer as below: 5′-AGC ATC TGC CTT GTG GGT-3′ and 5′AAG CTC TGT CAG CCT CGG CAC CCA GTT TCC CCT CCA GCC CAC ACA TA-3′. The product was digested with 5 U NdeI (Gibco BRL, Gainthersburg, Md., USA) at 37°C with 10 µl reaction mixture. The digested sample was electrophoresed on 3.0% Nusive 3:1 agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with an UV transilluminator. If the G→A mutated allele contained two fragments of 138 and 47 bp were observed af- ter NdeI digestion.

Statistical analyses

Values were expressed as mean ±SD. Statistical analysis was car- ried out using StatView version 4.5 (Abacus Concepts, Berkley, Calif., USA). Because distribution of triglyceride and lipopro- tein(a) were markedly skewed, these variables were logarithmically transformed for further statistical analyses. Comparisons between centenarians and controls were calculated by Student’s unpaired t test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare the three groups. The χ2 test was performed to detect differences in al- lele frequencies. Multiple regression analysis was calculated with HDL-C levels as dependent, and genetic markers and modifiable factors as independent variables to determine the quantitative ef- fects of covariates. Because the nonfasting blood sample was uti- lized triglyceride was not included for multiple regression analysis. Differences were considered significant at P<0.05.

CETP mutation in exon 15 (442D:G) was determined by PCR- RFLP as described by Takahashi et al. [5]. The primer was: 5′- CTC AAG CTT TGG GGC AGA AGG GAA T-3′ and 5′-CAG GAA TTC TGT CTG GGC CTT CTC TC-3′, generating a 392-bp fragment. After digestion by Taq1 the wild-type allele shows 240 and 70 bp fragments while the muted allele shows additional 76 bp.

Results

CETP Taq1B polymorphism was determined as described by Fumeron et al. [27] with minor modification. PCR was conducted using originally designed primers with denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, annealing at 60°C for 1 min and primer extension at 72°C for 1.5 min for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR product was digested with 5 U Taq1 at 65°C for 30 min, then electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel for Taq1B genotyping.

Candidate gene polymorphisms in the subjects

The distribution of genotype and allele frequencies for RCT gene polymorphisms in centenarians and controls is presented in Table 2 and Fig. 1. In both groups, the poly- morphisms of PvuII and HindIII of the LPL gene were in strong linkage disequilibrium by using maximum likeli- χ hood estimation ( 2=80.2, P<0.001 for centenarians, χ 2=64.1, P<0.001 for controls). Among seven polymor- phisms in four genes no significant gender differences were observed in genotype distribution and allele fre- quencies either in centenarians or in controls (data are not shown).

PvuII and HindIII polymorphisms of the LPL gene were deter- mined as described by Anderson et al. [28]. PvuII restriction site in intron 6 was amplified by the following primer: 5′-ATG GCA CCC ATG TGT AAG GTC-3′ and 5′-GTG AAC TTC TGA TAA CAA TCT C-3′, and the primer for HindIII polymorphisms in in- tron 8 was: 5′-TGA AGC TCA AAT GGA AGA GT-3′ and 5′- TCA AAG CAA ATG ACT AAA-3′. PCR products were digested overnight at 37°C with PvuII or HindIII. After digestion with PvuII the presence of restriction site resulted in 330- and 110-bp fragments, represented as P(+). The HindIII restriction site pro- vides a 600-bp fragment, indicated as H(+).

effects of mutations and the Taq1B the CETP gene, and the LPL PvuII genotype on levels among centenarians and controls are Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Both in centenarians heterozygous CETP deficiencies including 14 and exon 15 were consistently associated HDL-C concentrations (P=0.0003 and t test, respectively) and with markedly CETP concentration (P<0.0001 and t test, respectively). In regard to the genotype, the B2 allele was significantly with lower CETP mass and higher HDL-C in control (P=0.0387 and P=0.029, ANOVA, and a similar but nonsignificant trend was in centenarians. The B2 allele was lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in (P=0.024). There was a significant − P( ) allele of the LPL gene with lower higher HDL-C concentrations in centenarians, relationship was not observed in controls. There significant association between ABCA1 genotype parameters either in centenarians or in the LPL HindIII polymorphism nor the promoter polymorphism had significant with lipid parameters in centenarians and are not shown). When men and women were separately, the same results as shown in Table observed in centenarians of both sexes, statistical power was less in male centenarians. however, there was a significant association

Two common CETP deficiencies, an intron 14 splic- ing defect [4] and an exon 15 missense mutation [5], have been reported in the Japanese population. In this study there was no subject who was identified as homo- zygous CETP deficiency. There was no difference in fre- quencies of either type of heterozygous CETP deficien- cies between centenarians and controls. The distributions of the Taq1B polymorphism of the CETP gene, the LPL PvuIIand HindIII genotype, the C-514T polymorphism of the HL gene and recently identified R219K variant of the ABCA1 gene did not differ between centenarians and controls.

Discussion

deficiency and other genetic polymorphisms in RCT as a longevity factor for Japanese centenarians. The present study explored whether although heterozygous CETP de- ficiency is consistently associated with higher HDL-C concentrations both in centenarians and controls, this de- ficiency is not associated with longevity. In this point we agree with the results from the Omagari study reported by Hirano et al. [10]; however, our study provided no ev- idence that common CETP deficiency is disadvanta- geous for longevity. The allele frequencies of overall CETP deficiency in centenarians and controls were 0.035 and 0.042, respectively, which are similar to those of 0.042 in general population in Kanazawa [30] and 0.029 in Japanese-American men in the Honolulu Heart Study [6]. Although the number of centenarians with CETP deficiency was limited, we found no history of CAD or other atherosclerotic disease among those sub- groups. Neither was CETP deficiency associated with cognitive dysfunction or problems of activities of daily living in centenarians (data are not shown). To date much experimental and epidemiological data have been accumulated; however, the role of CETP on atherogene- sis is still in debating. Proatherogeneity of CETP defi- ciency is widely accepted to be caused by impairment of RCT. Results from the Honolulu Heart Study [6] indicate that a common CETP mutation could be a risk factor for CAD if it is combined with an HDL-C concentration be- tween 41–60 mg/dl. Hirano et al. [7] has reported that hyperalphalipoproteinemia caused by CETP gene defi- ciency can be associated with increased CAD when it combined with low HL activity. Hirano et al. [7] have also noted the interesting finding that CETP deficiency could not be susceptible for CAD if accompanied by higher LPL activity. These findings indicate that pro- atherogeneity of CETP deficiency may be compensated by other genetic and circumstantial factors such as key enzymes synergistically involved in reverse cholesterol transport and/or antiatherogenic property of HDL parti- cle itself. In the study, however, there was no significant difference in demographics and biochemical parameters except HDL-C and CETP mass between centenarians with CETP deficiency and those with wild type. Neither did frequency of the C allele of the promoter polymor- phism in the HL gene, which may be associated with in- creased with CAD, differ between the two groups (0.500, 0.504, P=0.961, respectively). Compatible with results from several epidemiological studies [8, 9, 31], we demonstrated that the B2 allele of

ed with lower CETP mass and with higher HDL-C con- centration in both centenarians and controls; however, we found no significant association with the allele and longevity. The result remained unchanged after exclud- ing the participants with CETP deficiency. Ordovas et al. [32] reported that the B2 allele is associated with higher HDL-C and with lower CAD risk only in men, not in women, in a population-based sample from the Framing- ham Offspring Study. In the present study even after re- striction to men there was no difference in frequencies of B2 alleles among centenarians and controls (0.400, 0.443, P=0.472, respectively). The reason for no associa- tion of two polymorphisms of CETP gene with longevity was unclear. Therefore we calculated haplotype frequen- cies of the 442D:G and Taq1B polymorphisms of CETP gene in centenarians and controls (Table 7). Despite the limited sample size we found extremely a lower frequen- cy of 442D:G and B1B1 haplotype than of 442D:G and χ B2B2 in centenarians (P=0.0328, 2). The frequency of the haplotype in centenarians seems to be lower than that χ in controls (P=0.2489, 2). The result indicated that the 442D:G and B1B1 haplotype in CETP gene could be disadvantageous for longevity. The findings should be investigated in a future study with large sample size.

− − a significant association between the LPL PvuII( / ) genotype and higher HDL-C concentration in centenari- ans but not in controls. Results from epidemiological studies on the association between the LPL genotype and serum lipid have been conflicting. Chamberlain et al. [11] reported significant associations between the LPL PvuII(+/+) genotype and higher triglyceride, and lower HDL-C. Wang et al. [12] confirmed a similar effect of the LPL PvuII(+) allele on triglyceride but not on HDL-C concentrations in whites. Gerdes et al. [13] reported that a dose-dependent associations of the LPL HindIII H(+) allele with higher HDL-C, while no significant as- sociation between the LPL PvuII genotype and any lipid variables in middle aged Danish men. The inconsistency of those results could be due not only to ethnicity, but also to confounding factors such as abdominal adiposity and other cardiovascular risk factors which may affect

the significance of LPL genotype. In the present study multiple regression analysis revealed that determinants of HDL-C concentration are quite different between cen- tenarians and controls, suggesting that the relationship between LPL polymorphisms and lipid levels could be modulated by environmental factors as previously de- scribed by Wang et al. [12]. It is possible that the LPL genotype has dual function on lipid metabolism in rela- tion to middle or old age.

ods in evaluating overall efficacy of reverse cholesterol transport is required to investigate what combination of candidate gene polymorphisms could be optimum for human longevity.

background of Tangier disease [33, 34, 35, 36], ABCA1 is proposed to play an important role in the first step in reverse cholesterol transport that stimulates cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein A1 from cell surface. Recently Clee et al. [16]. identified 16 single- nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCA1 gene, and among them, R219K K allele was associated with lower triglyceride, higher HDL-C, and lower CAD risk in Eu- ropean population. We observed no significant associa- tion between R219K polymorphism and longevity in Japanese centenarians, although the result did not contra- dict the possible contribution of ABCA1 gene polymor- phisms to longevity. Nakamura et al. [36] recently re- ported 162 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCA1 gene in Japanese population, the functional ef- fects of which should be investigated in the future.

associated with longevity in centenarians in Japan, where the prevalence of the deficiency is extremely high. In ad- dition, despite a significant impact of several genetic polymorphisms in RCT on plasma HDL-C concentra- tions in centenarians, there was no frequency difference between centenarians and controls for these polymor- phisms. These results, however, should be interpreted cautiously. There could be several reasons for our nega- tive results. First, it may be true that those loci have no impact on longevity. Our results were in line with those of Bladbjerg et al. [22]. that demonstrated no associa- tions of 11 gene polymorphisms chosen for their poten- tial risk for CAD with longevity for Danish centenarians. These findings suggest the possibility that the genetic polymorphisms, which have antiatherogenic or proath- erogenic property, could have no significant impact on longevity. Second, centenarians have been exposed dur- ing their lifetime to a very different environment than the control population and in other populations around the world where these loci have been examined for lipid me- tabolism and CAD risk. In 1970s when centenarians were most susceptible for CAD, their daily intake of fat was less than 10% of the calories in Japanese population; however, nowadays it rises to 25% and over (Ministry of Health and Welfare, National Nutrition Survey in Japan, 2000). Considering the low risk for CAD in the popula- tion, and the low-fat diet traditionally consumed in Japan it is not surprising that candidate genes for lipid metabo- lism have little effect on longevity. Third, it is possible that our study design and sample size may not have enough statistical power to address this issue. Further
