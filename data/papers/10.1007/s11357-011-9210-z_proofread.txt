region of the gene. However, the combined effect of these variants with other genes involved in energy metabolism and longevity has not been investigated in depth. In this study, we analyzed the interchromosomal interactions among IGF1R, IRS2, and UCP2 genes to determine their impact on metabolic profile, energy expenditure parameters, and mortality rate in a group of 722 Italian subjects. Our results showed that the AAV allele combination of these genes was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality and an increased probability of reaching extreme old age. Additionally, individuals with this allele combination exhibited lower HOMA-IR, higher respiratory quotient, and resting metabolic rate. These findings suggest that the combined effect of IGF1R, IRS2, and UCP2 genes on energy metabolism and age-related metabolic remodeling capacity is responsible for the observed effects on longevity. Overall, our study highlights the importance of investigating gene-gene interactions in understanding the genetic basis of human longevity.were calculated by using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The chi-square test was used to compare genotype distribution and allele frequency between groups. Continuous variables were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) and were compared using Student's t-test or ANOVA, as appropriate. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between genotype and longevity, adjusting for potential confounding factors such as age, sex, BMI, and smoking status.(HOMA-B cell) were calculated according to the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) (31-32): insulin resistance (IR) = FIG/22.5 and B cell function: 20FI/G 3.5, where FI = fasting insulin (mU/ml) and G = fasting glucose (mmol/l; Matthews et al. 1985; Bonora et al. 2000). To approximate normal distributions, plasma insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-B cell were logarithmically transformed and used in all calculations and back-transformed for result presentations. 

Genetic analysis: Genomic DNA was obtained from blood lymphocytes collected into EDTA-containing tubes using a commercial DNA extraction kit (Illustra, GE Healthcare UK Limited, Buckinghamshire, HP7 9 NA, UK). For each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the genotypic and allelic frequencies were calculated. The Chi-square test was used to compare the expected genotypic frequencies with the actual frequencies observed based on the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. The difference in genotype frequency between cases and controls was analyzed by standard contingency Chi-square test. In all subjects, the following UCP2 gene polymorphisms on Chromosome 11 were evaluated using PCR and restriction analysis: Ala55Val in exon 4 (rs660339), 866 G/A in the 5' region (rs659366), 45 ins/del in position 173247 of the AC019121. In particular, Ala55val gene polymorphism was evaluated using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Scheffe's test used for comparing plasma insulin levels, BMI, WHR, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B cell, energy expenditure among the genotype groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the association of gene variants with longevity independently of multiple covariates. Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated. Associations between genotypes and metabolic profile were analyzed using the general linear model. 

In the whole population, HOMA-B cell displayed an age-related decrease (r=0.174; p<0.05), whereas HOMA-IR increased with advancing age up to 80 years (r=0.303; p<0.001), while later it declined (r=0.235; p=0.001). Gender ratio confirmed a prevalence of females in the long-lived group. No difference in gender distribution was found in control subjects. All-cause and cause-specific mortality risks with 95% CI were calculated with the Cox proportional hazard model, using left censoring to correct for the delayed entry into the risk set according to age.

As expected and in agreement with that previously reported in recent studies on Italian centenarians, long-lived subjects had a significantly lower BMI, WHR, lower fasting plasma cholesterol, and higher HDL cholesterol. Furthermore, long-lived subjects displayed preserved insulin action despite a decreased HOMA-B cell compared to controls (Table 1). Linkage disequilibrium and allele combination analyses were performed using the Thesias program based on the stochastic-EM algorithm (Tregouet et al. 2004). The Thesias program allows estimation of both haplotype frequencies and covariable-adjusted haplotype effects by comparison with a reference haplotype taken as the most frequent haplotype in the current analyses. A global test of association between haplotypes and any studied phenotype was performed by means of a chi-square test with m-1 degrees of freedom in the case of m haplotypes.

Parameters were also evaluated. Rq displayed an age-related decrease (r=0.17; p<0.02) and was negatively correlated with plasma glucose levels (r=0.242; p<0.001). Similarly, RMR decreased with advancing age up to 85 years (r=0.407; p<0.001), without significant changes in long-lived subjects (r=0.086; p=0.482) while a negative association with WHR (r=0.192; p<0.05), plasma glucose levels (r=0.214; p=0.001), and HOMA-IR (r=0.168; p=0.001) was found.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software package. All metabolic parameters are presented as mean standard deviation (SD). Due to the well-known effect of age on energy expenditure parameters, to better highlight the diverse role of long-lived vs. control people, the whole study population was subdivided into three age groups. Long-lived subjects (n=82; mean age, 96±3 years) had fasting Rq significantly higher (0.75±0.05 vs. 0.79±0.05; p<0.001) than aged subjectsexpenditure and energy balance (Vidal-Puig et al. 2000). In this study, we found that individuals carrying the Asp/Asp genotype at the IGF1R locus and Val/Val genotype at the UCP2 locus had higher Rq and RMR compared to other genotypes. Furthermore, the AAV allele combination was associated with a decreased all-cause mortality risk, higher probability of reaching extreme old age, lower HOMA-IR, and higher RQ and RMR. These findings suggest that genetic variability in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway and UCP2 may play a role in energy expenditure and longevity.

It is important to note that different genetic and/or environmental backgrounds may modulate the effect of a given gene in different populations. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to investigate potential interactions between genes and environmental factors in the regulation of energy metabolism and aging.Expenditure (Astrup et al. 1999; Buemann et al. 2001; Walder et al. 1998). Interestingly, in our study, AAV haplotype has been found to be significantly associated with a lower degree of insulin resistance and higher energy expenditure parameters. This factor is associated with a variety of intermediate phenotypes (hypertension, atherosclerosis, obesity) that strongly affect morbidity, disability, and mortality among the elderly (Facchini et al. 2001). By contrast, humans beyond 85-90 years of age display preserved insulin action, and centenarians are surprisingly insulin-sensitive. 

In accordance with previous studies (Barbieri et al. 2008), a remarkably low insulin resistance (IR), as well as BMI, WHR, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were found in our long-lived people, confirming that these individuals are less prone to the metabolic derangement normally occurring with aging. Furthermore, as previously demonstrated in a small Italian cohort, despite an age-related decline in energy metabolism parameters, long-lived subjects had greater RQ and RMR compared to aged subjects (Rizzo et al. 2005). It is likely that the overrepresentation of AAV allele combination might help to explain such a peculiar phenotype found in long-lived subjects. In fact, through its effect on insulin resistance and energy expenditure parameters, the AAV allele combination might confer to long-lived subjects a better ability to preserve energy metabolism and delay the age-related metabolic derangement. Indeed, the effect on longevity is supported by the prospective analysis showing that the AAV allele combination is significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality risk.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that the effect of the insulin IGF1 signaling pathway on lifespan may be partially mediated by regulating the expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) (Bratic and Trifunovic 2010; Andrews et al. 2005). In flies, overexpressing human UCP2 (hUCP2) to adult neurons resulted in decreased oxidative damage and extended lifespan without compromising fertility or physical activity (Fridell et al. 2005). Furthermore, a very recent study has demonstrated that the absence of UCP2 shortens lifespan in wild-type mice, and the level of UCP2 positively correlates with the postnatal survival of superoxide dismutase 2 mutant animals (Andrews and Horvath 2009). Indeed, no difference in relative mortality risk among UCP2 gene variants was observed in a Dutch cohort (van Heemst et al. 2005).

G/A-IGF1R and Pro/Ala IRS2 variants in human longevity and allele combination analysis firstly demonstrate a combined effect of IGF1R, IRS2, and UCP2 genes on longevity being AAV allele combination overrepresented among long-lived subjects. Although the test for the univariate association between this UCP2-55T polymorphism and longevity was not statistically significant, allele combination analysis indicated that allele combination possessing allele Val of UCP2 is associated with an increased probability of reaching extreme old age. Such results support the hypothesis that interaction with a different protein (UCP): a protective stress signal in neuronal injury.
