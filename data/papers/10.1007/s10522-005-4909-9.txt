Abstract

Immune response in elderly is characterised by a progressive loss of the ability to cope environmental stressors with a characteristic remodelling of cytokine network. One of the data constantly reported in literature is the decrease of IL-2 production. An IL-2 central role in the reconstitution of T cell function in ) vitro is largely documented. Studies on a T fi G polymorphism at 330 nt of IL-2 gene promoter region have demonstrated that T lymphocytes from 330GG homozygous subjects are able to produce in vitro ) ) higher amount of IL-2, than 330TG heterozygous or 330TT homozygous subjects. As a genetic back- ground conditioning the maintaining of an efficient immune response would exert positive effects on healthy ageing, we have typed for 330T/G IL-2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 168 centenarians and 214 control subjects matched for age and ancestry from Centre and South Italy to check the 330GG genotype association to longevity. The statistical analysis doesn’t show a significant difference of genotypic and allelic ) frequencies at 330 IL-2 T/G SNP among centenarians and controls. Comparing the two cohorts of subjects by extended Mantel Haenszel procedure a marginally significant trend for an increased -330TT genotype frequency was observed. Our data seem to be paradoxical considering the role attributed to a well-conserved T cell function in the successful ageing. On the other hand, in a recent study on a sample of Irish octoge- ) narians a similar distribution of 330T/G genotype even was observed. These data suggest that a genetic background favouring an increased IL-2 production might be detrimental for longevity. On the other hand, an increase of IL-2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokine production characterise the Alzheimer’s disease ) serum profile. All in all our data seem to suggest that reduction of 330G allele frequency might be protective for healthy ageing limiting cell mediated inflammation implied in age associated diseases.

Introduction

some immunological parameters of the immune response are often notably reduced in the elderly (Franceschi et al. 1995; Cossarizza et al. 1997; Globerson and Effros 2000; Pawelec et al. 2002).

In ageing many alterations of both the innate and clonotypic immunity have been described. The modifications of the immune system in the elderly are generally evaluated as a deterioration of the immune system, this is the origin of the term immunosenescence. A good immune system in the elderly is tightly correlated to health, and

An age-related decline in IL-2 production has been recognized since the early work of Gillis et al. (1981) who identified a T cell growth factor, later called IL-2 that was decreased in

Recently, studies on a T fi G polymorphism ) at 330 nt of IL-2 gene (4q26–q27) promoter re- gion have demonstrated that T lymphocytes from ) 330GG homozygous subjects are able to pro- duce in vitro higher amount of IL-2, than ) ) 330TG heterozygous or 330TT homozygous subjects (Hoffmann et al 2001). In addition, it has been demonstrated that IL2 promoter-lucif- erase constructs, transfected in Jurkat cell line, showed twofold higher levels of gene expression ) in the 330 G allele (Matesanz et al. 2004). As a genetic background conditioning the maintaining of an efficient immune response would exert posi- tive effects on healthy ageing, we have typed for ) 330T/G IL-2 SNP, 168 centenarians and 214 control subjects matched for gender and ancestry from Centre and South Italy to check the ) hypothesis that 330GG genotype might be asso- ciated to longevity.

ageing. Subsequent studies showed that IL-2, essential for T cell proliferation and growth and for an efficient effector response, is reduced in aged subjects with associated effects on intracel- lular activation of nuclear transcription pathways (Candore et al. 1992; Caruso et al. 1996; Rea et al. 1996; Pawelec et al. 2002). Moreover hexogen IL-2 was found to reconstitute T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro (Candore et al 1996; Lio et al 2000).

On the other hand, individual changes in type and intensity of immune response affecting life span expectancy and health ageing seem to have a genetic component. A well-preserved immune function characterizing the ‘successful ageing’ has been found in long term surviving exceptional individuals that reach the extreme edge of human life. Centenarians, actually, seem to be genetically equipped for overcame the major age- related diseases and polymorphisms of the im- mune system genes regulating immune responses have been found associated to longevity (Caruso et al., 2005; Franceschi et al., 2005).

Materials and methods

Some recent evidence has linked cytokine poly- morphisms with longevity and differential lon- gevity between males and females and reciprocally with age-related diseases, which might cause elderly mortality thus influencing longevity. Differences in the genetic regulation of immune-inflammatory processes might explain why some people but not others develop theses diseases and why some develop a greater inflam- matory response than others (Bonafe et al. 2001; Lio et al. 2002a, b, 2003, 2004). In several cyto- kine genes, polymorphisms (mostly single nucleo- tide polymorphism, SNPs or microsatellites) located within the critical promoter or other reg- ulatory regions, affect gene transcription resulting in inter-individual variation in levels of cytokine production. The polymorphism may either di- rectly influences gene transcription or indirectly via tight linkage with other polymorphisms occurring elsewhere in the cytokine gene. The polymorphic nature of the cytokine genes may confer flexibility on the immune response with certain alleles promoting differential production of cytokines that may influence the outcome of infections or increase susceptibility and resistance to immune mediated disorders (Bidwell et al 1999, 2001).

Subjects and DNA sampling

DNA samples were obtained from 168 centenari- ans (>99 years old, 127 women and 41 men) from Centre (n=68) and South (n=100) Italy. Age was verified by researching archival records in the City Hall and/or Church registries, paying attention to the concordance between reported age and personal chronologies (age of marriage and of military service for men, age of first and last pregnancy for women, age of children, among others). DNA from 214 (112 women and 102 men) <50 years old controls matched for geographical origin were also collected. Written informed consent for enrolling in the study and for personal data management was obtained from all the subjects according to Italian laws. Blood specimens were collected in tripotassium EDTA sterile tubes and immediately stored at ) 70 (cid:2)C. Genomic DNA extraction was carried ) out and subsequently stored at 20 (cid:2)C for the IL-2 gene analysis.

Statistical analysis

primer with a modified sequence which creates a restriction site for the enzyme MaeI. The sequence modification was introduced to posi- tion -333 T fi G and the primers sequences used for this assay were: Forward 5¢ TAT TCA CAT GTT CAG TGT AGT TGT 3¢; Reverse 5¢TGG ATT CAC ACC CGA TTA CA 3¢. PCR-RFLP was carried out as follows: 10 ng of DNA was amplified in a 25 ll final volume PCR reaction containing 1(cid:1) Buffer (39.6 mM TRIS, 9.8 mM ammonium sulphate) 200 lM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl , 6.25 pmol of each primer; 1 Unit Taq 2 polymerase, and 1 M betaine PCR was carried out on Mastercycler Eppendorf thermal cycler. Cycling was performed at 95 (cid:2)C for 2 min. and 35 cycle at 95 (cid:2)C for 1 min, 48 (cid:2)C for 1 min, and 72 (cid:2)C for 1 min., followed by a final exten- sion of 5 min at 72 (cid:2)C. Following amplification PCR product was visualized on gel a 2% aga- rose gel stained with ethidium bromide This confirmed the presence of a 150 bp product. Mae I enzyme digestion was carried out in 20 ll final volume reaction using 3 Unit MaeI (Boeh- ringer, Mannheim, Germany) and 4 ll of PCR product. The reactions were overlaid with paraf- fin oil and incubated at 45 (cid:2)C overnight. The digestive products were visualized on 4% aga- rose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Materi- als from individuals homozygous for ) 330 T (wild type) don’t cut with MaeI and remains as a 150 bp product. The homozygous mutants () 330G) cuts with MaeI to give 124 and 26 bp fragments.

IL-2 frequencies were evaluated by gene count. The data were tested for the goodness of fit be- tween the observed and expected genotype values and their fit to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by v2 test. Analysis of statistical differ- ences between genotype frequencies in centenari- ans and controls was performed by v2. Analysis of statistical differences between allele frequencies in centenarians and controls was performed by Fisher exact test. Trend analysis was performed by extended Mantel Haenszel procedure.

Results

Genotypic frequencies of 330 T fi G IL-2 SNP in centenarians and controls from Centre and South Italy are shown in Table 1. The statistical analysis doesn’t show a significant difference of genotypic frequencies at -330 IL-2T/G SNP among centenarians and controls. Absence of statistical difference among centenarians and con- trols was confirmed analysing data stratified according to gender (Table 1). Comparing the two cohorts of subjects by extended Mantel Haenszel procedure a marginally significant trend ) for an increased 330TT genotype frequency was observed. Absence of statistical difference among centenarians and controls was confirmed by studying allele frequencies analysed on the whole (Table 2) or stratified according to the gender (data not shown).

ageing. Data are accumulating on the role that a high IL-2 production might play in immune- inflammatory mediated diseases. In humans, as reported by Solerte et al. (2000) high IL-2, as well as interferon-c and tumor necrosis factor- a, serum levels characterise subjects affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, IL-2 increase has been associated with evolving atherosclerosis and coronary events in stable and unstable angi- na patients (Elkind et al. 2005; Methe et al. 2005). So the role of IL-2 in ageing might be more complex than that postulated as adaptive response rescue factor in immunosenescence (Lio et al. 2000; Candore et al. 2002; Pawelec et al. 2002). Immunosenescence, actually, may be considered an attempt to adapt response to the stressors of an aged immune system (Franceschi et al. 2005). A beneficial mechanism (i.e. geneti- cally determined IL-2 high production), devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood, turn to be detrimental late in life, in a period largely not foreseen by evolutionary strengths, and the reduction of IL-2 production, at least in part fa- voured by genetic background, or modification of cellular machinery of signal transduction might be a protective adaptation against age- related diseases that are ‘‘the price we pay’’ for a life-long active immune system (Caruso et al. 2005; Licastro et al. 2005).

Discussion

mediated immune response and defects in IL-2 mediated activation (e.g. for a deficit of c chain of Il-2 receptor) induce severe immune deficiency (Demoulin and Renauld 1998). An age-related decline in IL-2 production with associated effects on intracellular activation of nuclear transcrip- tion pathways involving reduction of ERK2 activity (Douziech et al. 2002) is considered a marker for immune senescence (Candore et al. 1992; Caruso et al. 1996; Rea et al. 1996; Pawelec et al. 2002). Recently a polymorphism (T/G), reported in the promoter region of IL-2 at ) the nucleotide position 330, (John et al. 1998), has been shown to influence IL-2 production and in vitro cytokine production in anti-D3/CD28- stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (Hoffman et al. 2001). G allele frequencies of ) IL-2 330 polymorphism in smaller samples of Caucasian populations across Europe have been documented as 30–40% in Germany, in Ireland and in North Italy (John et al. 1998; Rey- nard et al. 2000; Ross et al. 2003; Uboldi de Ca- pei et al. 2003) and about 35% was observed in our control population.

To date there is only an other study on IL-2 ) 330 G/T polymorphism frequency in aged peo- ple (but not in centenarians). The data, obtained comparing young and elderly Irish subjects (Ross et al. 2003), were in agreement with our present findings, showing a not significant in- crease of T allele frequencies in elderly. So pres- ent and previous reports seem to suggest that IL-2 low producer genotype is marginally, but not significantly, associated to longevity.
