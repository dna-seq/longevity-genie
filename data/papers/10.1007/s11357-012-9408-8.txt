– (3):524 530, 2009). Based on the above study in mice, here we sought to search for AGTR1 variations associ- ated to reduced AT receptor protein levels and to pro- 1 longed lifespan in humans. AGTR1 was sequenced in 173 Italian centenarians and 376 younger controls. A novel non-synonymous mutation was detected in a cen- tenarian. Two polymorphisms in AGTR1 promoter, rs422858 and rs275653, in complete linkage disequilib- rium, were significantly associated with the ability to

Abstract Longevity phenotype in humans results from the influence of environmental and genetic factors. Few gene polymorphisms have been identified so far with a modest effect on lifespan leaving room for the search of other players in the longevity game. It has been recently demonstrated that targeted disruption of the mouse ho- molog of the human angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT R) gene (AGTR1) translates into marked prolonga- 1 tion of animal lifespan (Benigni et al., J Clin Invest 119

attain extreme old age. We then replicated the study of rs275653 in a large independent cohort of Japanese origin (598 centenarians and semi-supercentenarians, 422 younger controls) and indeed confirmed its associ- ation with exceptional old age. In combined analyses, rs275653 was associated to extreme longevity either at 0 recessive model (P 0.007, odds ratio (OR) 3.57) or at 0 genotype level (P 0.015). Significance was maintained after correcting for confounding factors. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis revealed that subjects homozygous for the minor allele of rs275653 had less AT R-positive peripheral blood polymorphonuclear 1 cells. Moreover, rs275653 was associated to lower blood pressure in centenarians. These findings highlight the role of AGTR1 as a possible candidate among longevity-enabling genes.

Introduction

The phenotype of human longevity has many diverse determinants. Non-genetic factors such as health habits, socioeconomic conditions, diet and physical activity account for an important part; however, emerging evi- dence suggests that genetic factors contribute in a major way to variation in human lifespan particularly in pop- ulations known for exceptional survival (Sirtori et al. 2001; Bilal et al. 2008). Genetic determinants of lon- gevity were initially reported in small, short-lived organ- isms including yeast, worm and flies, but a considerable number of these genes turned out to extend lifespan in mammals as well. Among plausible candidates for human longevity, polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E gene have been found to influence lifespan in multiple populations, probably through their association with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia (Corder et al. 1996). More recently, findings in two independent populations documented that polymor- phisms in the human forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A) gene, which encodes a key regulator of the insulin/ insulin growth factor 1 signalling pathway, were asso- ciated with the ability to attain exceptional old age (Flachsbart et al. 2009; Willcox et al. 2008). However, as can be expected for a polygenic trait like lon- gevity, variations of FOXO3A and of other genes in the insulin/insulin growth factor 1 signalling pathway found no or only modest effect on human lifespan (Flachsbart et al. 2009; Willcox et al. 2008; Pawlikowska et al. 2009). Thus, investiga- tions on further candidates with substantial benefi- cial effects on human lifespan are needed to fully disclose the determinants of human ageing.

A recent study demonstrated that mice deficient for angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT R) (AT R−/− ) 1A 1A

Lombardy region, northern Italy, was recruited through – years 2004 2009. The gender ratio was 83 % females to 17 % males. Subjects aged more than 99 years and 6 months were considered centenarians as they were in their 100th year of life. Centenarians were recruited through PRIN 2006 study. The younger control subjects (between 49 and 78 years of age, mean 65.9±9.1 years, 43 % females and 57 % males) were Italians unrelated to centenarians and recruited in the same geographical area through COFIN 2000 study.

ageing and had a significant prolongation of lifespan than wild-type littermates (Benigni et al. 2009). In rodents, two isoforms of AT R have been identified, 1 AT R and AT R, while human cells express a single 1A 1B AT receptor (AT R). Angiotensin II (AngII) has been 1 1 involved in organ senescence, given its capacity to robustly stimulate mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are crucially implicated in age-related organ damage including heart, kidney and brain (Wilson 1990; de Cavanagh et al. 2007) and contribute to the plethora of clinical phenotypes associ- ating with ageing (Min et al. 2009). Over time, exuber- ant ROS production exceeds the antioxidant defence of the mitochondrial and the nuclear enzymes, so that accumulating damage untimely destroys cells by apo- ptosis or necrosis (Benigni et al. 2010). The protection observed in AT R−/− mice from vascular damage and 1A the associated extension of lifespan were interpreted as a consequence of mitochondrial integrity provided by the expression of survival genes that limited oxidative stress (Benigni et al. 2009). These findings prompted us to investigate the possible role of variations of AGTR1 in influencing human longevity, with the hypothesis that mutations causing reduced AT R expression levels 1 might associate to prolonged lifespan in humans as observed in AT R-deficient mice. Our studies identi- 1A fied two allelic variants in AGTR1 promoter which are significantly overrepresented in Italian centenarians. This association was subsequently replicated in an in- dependent population of Japanese centenarians and controls.

The Japanese replication sample consisted of 589 – centenarians/semi-supercentenarians ageing 99 115 years (mean 104.5±3 years). The gender ratio was 84 % females to 16 % males. Centenarians and semi- supercentenarians were recruited through year 2000 un- til now through four series of screening involving the Tokyo metropolitan area; the centenarians address books published by Ministry of Health, Labor and Wel- fare from 1997 to 2002; all the Japanese nursing homes; the centenarian address lists available at local prefec- tures; and finally through articles published by local newspapers. Younger controls (between 69 and 72 years of age, mean 70.1±0.9 years, 52 % females and 48 % males) were 422 volunteers from Itami City and Asago City, Hyogo prefecture, Japan, who participated in SONIC Study for elderly subjects to investigate factors related to successful ageing in Japan. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

DNA analysis of

In the Italian group AGTR1 exons, their flanking ′ ′ regions, the 5 - and 3 -UTR regions (including ′ 250 bp of the promoter upstream 5 -UTR) were ampli- fied from genomic DNA and sequenced in the two directions on an ABI 3730 DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems). Primers (Online Resource 1) were designed according to AGTR1 genomic reference NC_000003, built 37.1, at National Center for Biotech- nology Information. Variants are referred to transcript variant 4 (NM_031850) RNA reference sequence and numbering begins with the ATG start codon. For quality control purposes, 5 % random sample was sequenced twice. Moreover, subjects carrying very rare genotypes (<5 %) were confirmed by repeating PCR reactions, followed by resequencing of both DNA strands.

Also, we demonstrate that the allelic variants in the promoter of AGTR1 are associated with reduced AT R 1 receptor expression levels in peripheral blood neutro- phils. In addition, screening of the whole coding region of AGTR1 in Italian cohort disclosed in one centenarian a novel mutation leading to amino acid substitution. Finally, we disclose an association between variants in AGTR1 promoter and diastolic blood pressure in centenarians.

Methods

For the replication study in the Japanese group, SNP genotyping was performed by TaqMan SNP assay (Applied Biosystems). The genotyping conditions for

Analysis of AT R presence in peripheral leukocytes 1

Fresh blood samples were processed for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) purification as described (Noris et al. 1999; Noris et al. 1996), labelled with an anti-human AT R antibody 1 (Anti AT-1, N-10, Santa Cruz) followed by incubation ’ with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat F(ab )2 fragment anti-rabbit IgG (eBioscience). To identify the various leukocyte subsets, cells were stained with fluorochrome- conjugated mAb antibodies against CD45, CD16, CD14, CD3, CD4 (BD Bioscience and Biolegend). The samples were analysed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis using FACSAria cytometer (BD Biosci- ence). Results were expressed as percentage of AT R 1 positive cells (percent).

Results

the Italian cohort, we sequenced exons and putative regions of AGTR1 to determine if any gene which may alter the amino acidic sequence or regulation, is differently represented in vs. younger controls. We identified eight previously reported variants (Fig. 1 and Online 2), including a non-synonymous variant leading to amino acid substitution at posi- 298 (p.Asn298Ser), which was found in a centenar- and not in controls. This change occurs in the transmembrane domain of AT R and is pre- 1 to be damaging in silico. In addition to the rare we have also observed ten known SNPs during sequencing of AGTR1, and therefore, we have eval- their distribution in centenarians and in controls 1; Table 1). Of the ten SNPs observed, two were in HW equilibrium and were removed from further The rs422858 is a dinucleotide change (AG/ but for practical reasons here, the major allele AG “ ” “ ” defined as A and the CC allele as C (Erdmann al. 1999). Single marker analysis in the eight SNPs passed the HW equilibrium test revealed signifi- different rs422858 and rs275653 genotype distri- 0 between centenarians and controls (P 0.004 for markers, Table 1). Rs422858 and rs275653, locat- − in the promoter region of AGTR1 at 174/173 bp and − 113 bp, respectively, are in complete linkage dis- Under the recessive model, the minor of rs422858 and rs275653 were significantly 0 to extreme old age (unadjusted P 0.003; 0 0 P 0.021; OR 4.55) (Table 1). significant difference was observed for rs422858 rs275653 also under the dominant and the additive but this difference did not pass the Bonferroni

Statistical analysis

Quantitative variables were expressed as mean±SEM. ANOVA and T test were used to compare continuous variables. Categorical variables were analysed by chi- square test. If n<5, exact Fisher test statistics was “ ” used. In the presence of a category with 0 frequency, the statistical analyses were performed using Elrm software for R (Zamar et al. 2007). Markers deviating – from the Hardy Weinberg (HW) equilibrium in the control population (P<0.05) were excluded from the analysis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence inter- vals were analysed using SISA statistics.

Haploview software v4.1 (Barrett et al. 2005) was used for blocks definition, haplotypes estimation and allelic association tests. Nominal P values were reported and were corrected for multiple testing by permutation 100,000 times. The Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing when appro- priate. Logistic regression analysis was performed using MedCalc software. Level of significance was set at a P value <0.05 assuming a two-tailed model.

Bioinformatic analysis

Rs2307085, located on exon 1, was nominally sig- 0 nificantly associated to longevity at both genotypic (P 0 0.022) and allele levels (P 0.023) (Table 1). Rs422858 and rs275653 together with rs2307085 were found to be in a single Haplotype block (Fig. 1, Online Resource 3).

The sequence variants found in AGTR1 promoter were analysed for potential transcription factors binding sites using TESS (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/ tess/tess). The effect of base substitution on protein

0 0 to longer lifespan (P 0.0092; OR 1.56) even after 0 correction for gender (P 0.00083). For each SNP ex- amined, there was no significant difference in the allelic and genotypic distribution between males and females.

In this block, the haplotype A-A-C was associated with 0 0 a reduced lifespan (nominal P 0.007, permuted P 0.024); consistently, the minor C-G-C haplotype was 0 nominally associated with longevity (P 0.028) (Online Resource 3). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed a significantly different distribution of the rs275653 (and the linked rs422858) genotypes among 0 centenarians and controls (P 0.0066), while no signif- icance was observed for all the other SNPs. After adjust- ing for gender, rs275653 exhibited a stronger effect than 0 without adjustment (P 0.00095).

These results prompted us to validate the association data between variants of rs275653 and longevity in a Japanese population of 589 centenarians/semi-supercentenarians and in younger individuals whose age was comparable to that of Italian controls. We chose to study a population of different ethnic origin because the Japanese population is

one of the most long-lived and includes a high number of centenarians. Data of 1000 Genomes project in Japanese population indicate that rs275653 and rs422858 are in complete LD as in Italian subjects, so we chose to geno- type rs275653 because of the availability of a commercial TaqMan assay. In accordance to 1000 Genomes and Hap- Map data, in Japanese population the minor allele of rs275653 had a lower frequency (0.084) than in Italian – controls (0.158). Case control analysis of rs275653 in Japanese cohort revealed that the GG genotype was sig- nificantly associated to longevity under the recessive and 0 0 additive models (P 0.046 and P 0.047, respectively, 0 Table 2). Genotype distribution evidenced a trend (P 0.077) while no difference was observed with the domi- nant model and at allele level (Table 2).

of the minor rs275653 G allele between Italian and Japanese cohorts, an enrichment of the GG genotype was evident in both groups of centenarians as com- pared to controls, we performed further analyses merging the two populations. In the combined analy- sis, association of rs275653 with longevity was 0 observed using the recessive (P 0.007) and the addi- 0 tive models (P 0.009) (Table 2). Also, genotypic frequencies were significantly different between cen- tenarians and controls in the overall population 0 (P 0.015). After adjusting for confounding factors, namely gender, antihypertensive treatment and popu- 0 lation of origin, logistic regression gave P 0.00034 0 and P 0.00151 for the association between longevity and rs275653 considering either genotype distribution or the recessive model, respectively (Table 3).

FACS analysis of AT R on leukocyte populations 1

Given that the rs275653 SNP and the linked rs422858 are localized in the promoter region, we hypothesized that they might affect AGTR1 expression. We conducted in silico analyses to evaluate whether the allelic variants of rs275653 and rs422858 were associated with the presence/absence of DNA binding factors in AGTR1 promoter. Using Tess, we found that the region includ- ing the major allele variant A of rs422858 contains an E-box element (CANNTG), which can be the target of helix-loop-helix transcription factors, including Tal1 and NF-uEA. By contrast, the C allele, which is more frequent in our centenarians, causes the loss of the E-box site. No putative binding sites were predicted for allele variants of SNP rs275653 which, however, is in

complete linkage disequilibrium with rs422858. Thus, we sought to investigate whether genetic variants in AGTR1 promoter could affect AT R receptor pres- 1 ence on peripheral blood leukocytes by FACS. Due to the low frequency of subjects homozygous for the minor alleles of rs422858 and rs275653, we could identify one Italian centenarian with this ge- notype alive at the time of laboratory determina- tions, so we decided to extend the observation of AT R presence to younger controls. Three groups 1 of subjects, each including one centenarian and four younger controls and differing for their geno- type at rs275653 (GG, AG and AA), were evalu- ated. The three groups of subjects were comparable for total cholesterol (GG 227±48 mg/ dL; AG 198±30 mg/dL; AA 185±24 mg/dL) and lipids. By FACS analysis, we found specific ex- pression of AT R both on PMNs (57.5±14 %) and 1 on PBMC (17.3±8.9 %), which include mono- cytes, B and T cells. A representative flow cyto- metric analysis of AT R on PMNs and on their 1 CD16+ subset is shown in Fig. 2a, b. In PMNs of subjects homozygous for the minor rs275653 var- iant, significantly less cells positive for AT R (GG: 1 mean 42.8±8.8 %, median 43.5 %) were found as compared to heterozygous (AG: mean 68.9±10.9 %, 0 median 66.8 %, P 0.0024) or homozygous individuals for the common allele (AA: mean 60.7±10.4 %, median 61.0 %, P0 0.0185) (Fig. 2c). Analysis of AT R cell 1 surface presence in the PMN CD16+ fraction showed significantly lower percentage of AT R-positive cells in 1 subjects homozygous for the minor rs275653 allele (GG: mean 68.0±8.1 %, median 64.4 %) in respect to heterozygous (AG: mean 87.0±6.1 %, median 87.4 %, 0 P 0.0030) or homozygous subjects for the common

0 allele (AA: mean 81.1±4.5 %, median 80.5 %, P 0.0134) (Fig. 2d). AT R protein levels in PBMCs 1 showed a similar trend as in PMNs; however, differ- ences among rs275653 genotype subgroups did not reach statistical significance (AT R-positive cells in 1 PBMC according to genotype GG: mean 16.9±5.7 %; AG: mean 20.5±7.7 %; AA: mean 19.3±7.1 %). Failure to find a statistical difference in the percentage of AT R-positive cells among genotypes is likely attribut- 1 able to the high individual variability along with the small number of subjects analysed.

Association of rs275653 and blood pressure

High blood pressure is associated with severe compli- cations, including heart, kidney disease and stroke, which reduce life expectancy in humans. The renin– angiotensin system is involved in blood pressure reg- ulation and vasoconstriction to the extent that knock- ing out the AT R gene causes hypotension in mice 1 (Oliverio et al. 1998). Based on this observation, we evaluated whether rs275653 was associated with changes in blood pressure.

Centenarians with GG genotype of rs275653 had lower blood pressure, either systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) or mean arterial pressure (MAP) with respect to centenarians with AA genotype. This difference was statistically significant for DBP under recessive (P0 0.040) and additive model (P0 0.031) as well as at allele analysis (P0 0.037) (Fig. 3). A significant difference was observed for SBP and MAP at allele analysis.

Discussion

Here we have identified a region in the promoter of human AGTR1 associated to extreme longevity. Stud- ies on a test group of Italian centenarians and controls provided evidence of a significant association between SNP variants of AGTR1 and human lifespan. These

Although studies in short-lived organisms and in human isolated populations with exceptional lifespan have clearly shown that genes play a role in longevity,

Japanese cohort, characterized by a large number of centenarians and semi-supercentenarians of homoge- neous ethnic origin, confirmed an enrichment of the G allele in centenarians and its association to longevity according to the recessive model. Combined analyses sustained the association at genotype level. Data of European and Japanese populations from 1000 Genomes and from HapMap databases as well as our results on the Italian group demonstrate that rs275653 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs422858. The absence of the rs275653 GG genotype in our Japanese controls diverges from the data of the small cohort of Japanese subjects in 1000 Genomes database (rs275653 GG genotype: one over 90 subjects). How- ever, comparison of the genotype prevalence in Japa- nese population of 1000 Genomes and in our Japanese controls failed to evidence any statistical difference both at genotype and at allele level.

variant of rs422858 belongs to an E-box element which is lost in the presence of the minor allele. Supportive evidence to our genetic data comes from ex vivo findings indicating that the longevity- associated variants have functional consequences on the expression of the corresponding receptor protein on the surface of circulating cells. Indeed, by FACS experiments, we demonstrated that PMNs of subjects homozygous for the minor rs275653 allele (and con- sequently for the C variant of rs422858) had a signif- icantly lower percentage of AT R-positive cells with 1 respect to subjects heterozygous and homozygous for the major allele. A similar difference was observed when the CD16+ PMN fraction was analysed. Consis- tently, previously reported transfection experiments in adrenal cortical and in vascular smooth muscle cells (Kumar et al. 2005) documented that reporter con- structs containing the A rs422858 variant had higher promoter activity than constructs with the minor C variant, suggesting that this SNP could affect the lev- els of AT R gene transcription. 1

Fig. 3 Blood pressure in Italian and Japanese centenarians according to rs275653 genotype. Data are represented as mean± SEM. a Diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in cen- tenarians with GG genotype as compared to those AA genotype (additive model, P00.031) or to centenarians with AA and AG genotypes (recessive model, P00.040). G allele was also associ- ated to reduced DBP (P00.037). SBP and MAP (b and c, respec- tively) were statistically different in centenarians carrying the rs275653 G allele (P00.046 and P00.042, respectively)

the specific genetic variants involved are still largely unknown. Evidences in mammals point to a role of genes involved in the major causes of death, i.e. car- diovascular disease, cancer and brain disease. The vasoactive hormone AngII has been involved in organ senescence, and in previous studies, we demonstrated that disruption of the mouse gene encoding for AT R 1A markedly prolonged animal lifespan (Benigni et al. 2009) and protected mice from vascular and cardiac injury.

Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that SNP variations in the AGTR1 promoter can influence protein levels of the corresponding receptor and that a region including or linked to the AGTR1 promoter could play a role in modulating local RAS system. Since our sequencing-based screening study was con- fined to the proximal portion of AGTR1 promoter and to coding regions and intron/exon boundaries, the possibility that rs275653 and the linked rs422858

Here we demonstrate that in an Italian cohort, the C variant of rs422858 and the linked G-variant of rs275653 are overrepresented in centenarians with an OR of 4.55 according to the recessive model, in line with what should be expected for a polygenic trait like longevity.

2010). Other studies have found an association of ′ another SNP, the rs5186 (A1166C) in the 3 -UTR region of AGTR1, with hypertension and the metabolic syndrome (Mottl et al. 2008; Palatini et al. 2009). The A1166C SNP affects AT R expression (Sethupathy et 1 al. 2007) since the A variant is the target of the micro- RNA hsa-miR155. In untreated hypertensive young subjects, a correlation among protein expression levels and rs5186 genotype has been recently demonstrated (Ceolotto et al. 2011). In the Italian cohort, we failed to see any association of rs5186 with human longevity, suggesting that the mechanisms by which rs422858/ rs275653 or linked factors affect lifespan are not lim- ited to its effects on blood pressure. In both Italian and Japanese centenarians, however, we observed a statis- tically significant decreased systolic blood pressure in homozygous for GG rs275653 genotype suggesting that this polymorphism might influence blood pres- sure. In control subjects, we observed a reduction of SBP in subject homozygous for GG genotype; how- ever, this difference was not statistically significant. It is likely that the wide range of age in the control population may have masked the association between the G allele of rs275653 and lower blood pressure.

It is likely that the rs275653 and rs422858 minor allele variants or other linked elements in the AGTR1 promoter dampen cell surface levels of AT R protein 1 in PMNs as well as in their CD16+ subset. AT R levels 1 in several cell types including neutrophils have been shown to be affected by hypercholesterolemia or dys- lipidemia (Marino et al. 2007, 2009; Guasti et al. 2008). In the present study, blood cholesterol and lipids were not different among subjects with GG, GA or the AA genotypes of rs275653, thus ruling out that changes in blood lipid profile accounts for the differences in AT R expression. 1

Local AngII can be produced by tissues and cells, including circulating cells, due to the presence of the complete enzymatic machinery required to synthesize and transform angiotensinogen (Jurewicz et al. 2007; Rasini et al. 2006). Moreover, AngII and its precursors can increase, in a dosage-dependent manner, the mitogen-stimulated T and NK cell proliferation thus playing a role in the induction of inflammatory re- sponse and oxidative stress (Jurewicz et al. 2007). In PMNs of patients with peripheral artery disease, in- creased levels of AT R have been demonstrated, sug- 1 gesting a role for AT R in the inflammatory processes 1 which occur in atherosclerosis (Marino et al. 2009). AT R stimulation of human neutrophils by AngII 1 − increases O and ROS production (El Bekay et al. 2 2003; Paragh et al. 2002) through increased cytosolic Ca++ levels, and such response is exacerbated in dia- betes (Inukai et al. 2005) and hypertension (Alba et al. 2008). Based on the above evidence, the results of the present paper might be taken to suggest that a reduced number of AT R on PMNs of subjects carrying the 1 minor rs275653 and rs422858 alleles translates into a reduced capability of such cells to generate ROS, thus creating anti-inflammatory state as to slow cell senes- cence. Further studies are needed to confirm this as- sumption and assess whether the variation observed in receptor expression only takes place in PMNs or is shared by other cell types.

Through AGTR1 exon sequencing of the Italian centenarians and younger controls, we discovered few novel variants, all but one in the non-coding regions. Interestingly, the only novel variant leading to amino acid substitution (c.893A>G, p.Asn298Ser) was found in a centenarian. This mutation is not in LD with promoter SNPs, and it is likely a private mutation. It occurs in the highly conserved NPxxY motif of most G-protein-coupled receptors, which is involved in the initiation of signal transduction following ligand bind- ing (Rosenbaum et al. 2009). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have previously shown that Asn298Ser replace- ment reduced the number of binding sites and impaired the receptor signalling in respect to the wild-type recep- tor, suggesting that the change found in our centenarian could affect AT R activity (Nikiforovich et al. 2006). 1 Further studies are needed to confirm this finding in humans. Our results indicate that genetic AGTR1 variants leading to reduced receptor expression may contribute to prolong human lifespan. These findings are of particular relevance as they disclose AT R as a 1 peculiar pharmacological target for the prevention and treatment of disabilities and diseases that occur with

Allelic variations in AGTR1 promoter, including the rs422858 major allele, have been associated with hy- pertension in Caucasian women (Kumar et al. 2005). Very recently, SNPs in AGTR1 promoter have been associated to the risk of hypertension also in Mexicans (Martinez-Rodriguez et al. 2011) and to salt sensitivity
