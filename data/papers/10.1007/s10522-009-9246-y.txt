in blood mononuclear cells of people divided into three age groups (mean ages 28.7, 65.8 and 92.7 years old) showed that extreme longevity is associated with the decrease of the mean level of the specific mRNA; the differences between young or middle-aged vs. extremely old group were significant (P \ 0.0001, P \ 0.0001, respectively). In addition, the methylation pattern of the XPD promoter was analyzed in 30 people divided into three age groups (29.5, 65.9, and 101.4 years old). We showed that overall methylation of the XPD promoter is a rare event; however, aging is associated with the increase of methylation level upstream of the transcription start site. In summary, we showed for the first time that both the XPD polymorphic variants and the decreased level of its expression might be associated with aging.

mic instability. The XPD gene encodes a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair and in transcrip- tion. We analyzed the common XPD polymorphisms that were previously shown to affect protein’s DNA repair efficiency and to increase the risk of developing various cancers. Analysis was performed in 149 centenarians (mean age 101.1 years old) and in 413 young subjects (mean age 27.1 years old). We showed that the distribution of the Lys751Gln genotypes differed significantly between these groups (P = 0.017). In centenarians, the homozygous geno- types AA and CC were found less frequently than in young controls (29 vs. 36%, OR = 0.71, and 14 vs. 20%, OR = 0.652, respectively). The Arg156Arg and Asp312Asn were not significantly associated with extreme longevity. Analysis of the XPD mRNA level

Introduction

Aging is a progressive, inevitable process affecting all human tissues. It depends on multiple environmental and endogenous factors, and, according to widely accepted theory, is a result of life-long accumulation of stochastic damage to the genomic DNA and to other

an increased number of micronuclei and of chromo- somal aberrations compared to their young counter- parts (Burhans and Weinberger 2007; Kazim´ırova´ et al. 2009), we hypothesized that genes involved in the maintenance of genomic stability are involved in normal aging.

intra-cellular molecules such as key proteins and lipids (Terman and Brunk 2006; Petropoulos and Friguet 2006; Vin˜a et al. 2007; Hayflick 2007; Schumacher et al. 2008; Blagosklonny 2008; Afanas’ev 2009). Aging results in limiting the ability of the organism to maintain homeostasis, making it vulnerable to the development of different age-associated diseases such as diseases of the cardiovascular system, cancers and neurodegeneration (Taddei et al. 2006; Crews 2007; Jahangir et al. 2007; Ehrlich et al. 2008; Pietschmann et al. 2008; Andreassi 2008; Yankner et al. 2008).

by Sung and co-workers as a gene which result in cancer-prone xeroderma pigmen- type D (XPD) syndrome (Sung et al. 1993). gene is composed of 23 exons (Frederick et al. and encodes the xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) protein which is a helicase that also possesses ATPase activity et al. 1993). XPD associates with transcription IIH (TFIIH), a multisubunit protein complex in RNA polymerase II transcription and in excision repair (NER) of genomic DNA (Sung et al. 1993; Go¨zu¨kara et al. 1994; et al. 1996; Cullinane et al. 1997; Evans al. 1997; Winkler et al. 2000). It also plays a role in apoptosis (Wang et al. 1996). Its result not only in the XPD syndrome, but in the XPD-Cockayne precocious aging syn- (XPD-CS) and in trichothiodystrophy (TTD), segmental progeria. However, disease phe- cannot be predicted from the position of residue. Crystal structure analysis of vari- mutated XPD molecules shed some light on this it seems that XPD mutations impair helicase activity, XPD-CS mutations alter activity and movements of Rad51/RecA-like domain 2, and TTD mutations impair TFIIH (Lehmann 2001; Lambert et al. 2008; Fan

It is estimated that genetic factors make up 25–30% of the causative agents of aging (McGue et al. 1993; Herskind et al. 1996; Finch and Ruvkun 2001). A number of genes have been identified as being involved, to various degrees, in regulating the aging process (Shimokawa et al. 2008; Slijepcevic 2008). These are, for example, genes encoding sirtuins (SIRT), a family of deacetylases modifying histones and other proteins such as transcription factors (Wood et al. 2004; Longo and Kennedy 2006; Kuningas et al. 2007; Milne and Denu 2008; Julien et al. 2009), genes encoding different elements of insulin and of insulin- like growth factor 1 pathways such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors, KLOTHO protein, and FOXO transcription factors (Kuro-O et al. 1997; Arking et al. 2002; Kurosu et al. 2005; DiStefano et al. 2007; Suh et al. 2008; Selman et al. 2008; Flachsbart et al. 2009; Bonafe` and Olivieri 2009), and genes the protein products of which, catalase and superoxide dismutases, are involved in the deactivation of reactive oxygen species (Hari et al. 1998; Parkes et al. 1998; Kirby et al. 2002; Blander et al. 2003; Landis and Tower 2005; Di Massimo et al. 2006; Paul et al. 2007).

Another group of genes that might be involved in regulating the rate of aging comprises those whose mutations result in segmental progeroid syndromes. Such syndromes are characterized by the presence of a number of features similar to these of normal aging, but, in addition, each of them has its own specific signs and symptoms (Puzianowska-Kuznicka and Kuznicki 2005; Kudlow et al. 2007). On the molecular level, the majority of them are associated with impaired DNA repair, defects in transcription, and with genetic instability (de Boer et al. 2002; Andressoo and Hoeijmakers 2005; Puzianowska-Kuznicka and Kuznicki 2005; Neveling et al. 2007; Andressoo et al. 2009). Since normal senescent cells also have

The most extensively studied are three common XPD polymorphisms: the Arg156Arg C[A located in exon 6, the Asp312Asn G[A in exon 10, and the Lys751Gln A[C in exon 23. The majority of published data report correlations of these polymor- phisms with cancer risk (Wang et al. 2008). Although not completely consistent among themselves, these reports suggest that these polymorphisms might modify the risk of development of different cancer types including lung (Spitz et al. 2001; Kiyohara and Yoshimasu 2007; Hung et al. 2008), breast (Just- enhoven et al. 2004; Terry et al. 2004), skin (Vogel et al. 2001; Brewster et al. 2004; Millikan et al. 2006; Li et al. 2006), digestive tract (Ye et al. 2006; Wang

et al. 2008; Joshi et al. 2009) and blood (Wang et al. 2008) cancers.

from the Y group (22–37 years old, mean age 28.7 years old), in 18 people of middle age (M, 60– 69 years old, mean age 65.8 years old,), and in 17 extremely old subjects (90–100 years old, mean age 92.7 years old). All participants gave a written consent for participation in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw.

In this work we present evidence that certain Lys751Gln genetic variants of the XPD gene might be associated with the promotion of longevity, while the Arg156Arg and Asp312Asn polymorphisms show no such association in the Polish population. We also show that expression of the XPD gene, assessed in blood mononuclear cells, decreases in an age-depen- dent manner, which might be one of the reasons for the increase of genomic instability observed by other authors in senescent cells.

DNA isolation and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis

Four milliliter blood samples were used for isolation of the genomic DNA that was performed using salting-out procedure (Miller et al. 1988). Genotyping of the selected polymorphism in the XPD was done by PCR amplification followed by digestion with an appropriate restriction enzyme (restriction fragment length polymorphism method—RFLP). PCR–RFLP conditions used for the analysis are shown in Table 1. The restriction fragments obtained were visualized on 2–3% agarose gels (Fig. 1a–c).

Study subjects

in two age groups: 149 Polish centenarians (C, 99.6– 107.2 years old, mean age 101.1 years old, 130 women, 19 men)—participants of the ‘‘PolStu99’’ study (Mossakowska et al. 2008). The control group consisted of 413 blood donors and volunteers (Y, 18– 45 years old, mean age 27.1 years old, 232 women, 181 men). Analysis of the XPD promoter methylation was performed in 10 subjects from the Y group (25– 37 years old, mean age 29.5 years old) and in 10 subjects from the C group (100–102.4 years old, mean age 101.4 years old), as well as in 10 additional subjects that formed another control group (M, 65.3– 66.5 years old, mean age 65.9 years old). Analysis of the XPD expression was performed in 19 subjects

Bisulfite treatment of DNA and DNA methylation analysis

Bisulfite modification of the genomic DNA was performed using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Orange, CA, USA). Five hundred nanogram of each genomic DNA was bisulfite-modified following the manufacturer’s pro- tocol with the only modification being the PCR incubation conditions; the samples were subjected to

RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR

10 min and 53(cid:3)C for 30 min, then 8 cycles of 53(cid:3)C for 6 min, 37(cid:3)C for 30 min. Bisulfite-treated DNA was purified and resuspended in 10 ll of the M- elution buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Fifty nanogram (1 ll) of this DNA was used as a template in 12.5 ll PCR reaction performed with hot-start Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and with sense XPDsl 50GAGGATTAAATT TTAGTGAATGAGAT30 and antisense XPDasl 50AT AACCCCATCTTCAAAACCCCC30 primers. The PCR conditions were: initial denaturation at 94(cid:3)C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94(cid:3)C for 30 s, 58(cid:3)C for 30 s, 72(cid:3)C for 1 min, final elongation at 72(cid:3)C for 10 min. The PCR product of 377 bp, corresponding to the XPD promoter fragment located on both sides of the transcription start site, was gel-purified and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Three clones from each person were sequenced.

Total RNA was extracted from BMCs with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the procedure supplied by the manufacturer. One hundred nanogram of each RNA was used for reverse transcription that was performed with RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Lituania) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The result- ing cDNA was diluted in DNAse, RNAse-free dH O 2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Next, 1 ll of cDNA corresponding to 0.5 ng of total RNA was used as a template in real-time PCR. The reaction was performed in LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) with LightCycler 480 Sybr Green I Master kit (Roche, Mannheim, Ger- many) and with XPD 50CATTTCCTGGGCTTCCTG AG30 sense and 50GCTCTCCTGCACCACATGCT30 antisense primers, as well as with sense 50CAGCCT GGATAGCAACGTACA30 and 50TTCTACAATGA GCTGCGTGTG30 antisense b-actin control gene primers. PCR conditions were: initial incubation at 95(cid:3)C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95(cid:3)C for 12 s, 60(cid:3)C for 12 s, 72(cid:3)C for 12 s, then one melting curve cycle. The results obtained for the XPD gene were normal- ized against the results for the b-actin gene.

Blood mononuclear cells (BMCs) were isolated according to the method of Neitzel (Neitzel 1986) with modifications. Briefly, 4 ml of full blood were centrifuged at 25009g for 20 min at 4(cid:3)C. The bottom layer of approximately 2 ml, containing all types of blood cells, was diluted in 4 ml of phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) and the resulting suspension was overlayed onto 3 ml of lymphocyte separation medium LSM 1077 (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) or of LymphoSep (MP Biomed- icals, Irvine, CA, USA). The samples were centri- fuged at 6009g for 20 min at 19(cid:3)C. The layer of BMCs was collected and washed twice with PBS.

Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed using the Statistica software package (StatSoft, Tulsa OK). Hardy–Wein- berg equilibrium and differences in genotype frequen- cies between the analyzed groups were checked with the chi-square test. The distribution of genotypes was analyzed in three models of inheritance: dominant,

recessive and codominant using 2 9 2, 2 9 2, 3 9 2 contingency tables, respectively. The differences in quantitative parameters between groups were assessed using t-student/U Mann–Whitney test. For all tests the level of significance was established at 0.05.

heterozygotes were more frequent (57 vs. 44%, P = 0.0047, OR = 1.72, [95%CI: 1.18–2.51] than in the young controls. For the Arg156Arg and Asp312Asn polymorphisms no significant differences in the genotypes distribution were observed in the studied groups. Exclusion of the subjects suffering from cancers (n = 8) or myocardial infarction (n = 10) from the C group had no major influence on the genotypes frequencies in this group (data not shown).

XPD expression in blood mononuclear cells

The frequencies of each genotype in centenarian group of 149 subjects (C, 99.6–107.2 years old, mean age 101.1 years old, 130 females, 19 males) and in young control group of 413 subjects (Y, age range 18–45 years old, mean age 27.1 years old, 232 females, 181 males) are shown in Table 2. No significant difference in the distribution of genotypes in females and in males was observed. The distribu- tion of Lys751Gln genotypes differed significantly between the studied groups (P = 0.017). In cente- narians, the homozygous genotypes AA and CC were found less frequently (29 vs. 36%, OR = 0.71 [95%CI: 0.47–1.07], and 14 vs. 20%, OR = 0.652 [95%CI: 0.39–1.09], respectively), whereas the AC

XPD mRNA level in blood mononuclear cells was assessed in 54 people divided into three age groups: 22–37 years old (Y, 19 people, mean age 28.7 years old), 60–69 years old (M, 18 people, mean age 65.8 years old), and 90–100 years old (C, 17 people, mean age 92.7 years old), using real-time PCR. The results obtained for the XPD gene were normalized against the levels of the control b-actin mRNA. Real- time evaluation showed that the level of the specific XPD mRNA varied significantly between cases within each age group: the difference ranged up to 6.5-fold in the Y, 2.5-fold in the M, and twofold in

This fragment contains 35 potential methylation sites: 23 upstream and 12 downstream of the transcription start site. Sequencing of three clones from each person (30 in total in each age group) showed that, overall, the analyzed promoter fragment was not heavily meth- ylated. In 3 Y, 2 M, and 2 C subjects it was methylation-free, while in the remaining persons 1–3 out of 35 potential sites were methylated. In total, out of 350 potential methylation sites (100%) in each age group, in the Y group methylation was present in 11 sites, in the M group in 16 sites, and in the C group in 15 sites (Fig. 3) which corresponds to 3.14, 4.57, and 4.29%, respectively. The differences between the Y and M, Y and C, as well as the M and C age groups were not significant (P = 0.345, P = 0.513, P = 0.857, respectively). However, older age was associated with the increase of methylation at the sites located upstream of the transcription start site (230 potential sites—100%—in each age group): while in the Y group only 2 methylated sites within this promoter fragment were detected, in the M group methylation number raised to 9, and in the C group to 7 which corresponds to 0.87, 3.91, 3.04%, respec- tively. The difference between Y and M groups was significant (P = 0.043), while the difference between Y and C, as well as M and C groups did not reach the level of significance (P = 0.1, P = 0.966, respec- tively). No clear correlations were noticed between methylated sites and the relative XPD mRNA level in subjects in which both analyses were performed.

When the mean level of the XPD mRNA in young Y subjects was normalized to 100% (±45.16% SD), the relative mean amounts of this mRNA were 99.05 ± 31.21% in middle-aged M group and 60.30 ± 24.47% in extremely old C group. Statistical analysis showed that the mean level of the specific mRNA was significantly lower in the C group compared to the Y and to the M group (P \ 0.0001, P \ 0.0001, respectively). The differ- ence between the Y and M was not significant (P = 0.941, Fig. 2).

The methylation status of the 377 bp (-278 to ?99) fragment of the XPD promoter was assessed in 30 people divided into three age groups: 25–37 (Y, 10 people, mean age 29.5 years old), 65.3–66.5 (M, 10

Discussion

Recently, it has been shown that the levels of micronuclei and chromosome aberrations in the cells of the elderly are significantly higher than in the cells of young people (Kazim´ırova´ et al. 2009). This supports the notion that DNA repair capacity decreases with age (Burhans and Weinberger 2007; Slijepcevic 2008; Schumacher et al. 2008). XPD is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. Its effectiveness depends both on the level of its expression and on its polymorphic variant. In this work we show that aging is associated with the progressive decrease of the amount of XPD mRNA and with the change of methylation pattern of the

Fig. 2 Mean amounts of XPD mRNA in blood mononuclear cells of young, middle-aged and extremely old human subjects. The mean amount of the XPD mRNA is significantly lower in blood mononuclear cells of extremely old persons than in younger age groups. Assessment of the XPD mRNA was performed using real-time PCR. Results obtained for the XPD mRNA were normalized against those of b-actin mRNA. Y (young) 22–37 years old subjects, n = 19; M (middle-aged) 60–69 years old subjects, n = 18; C (extremely old) 90– 100 years old subjects, n = 17

clear correlation of the detected methylation sites with the amount of XPD mRNA. There are two potential explanations of this observation. First, the pattern of methylation in clones isolated from the same donor usually was not identical and, since the number of analyzed clones was limited to three, it was impossible to judge which pattern dominates in a given donor’s BMCs and to correlate it with the mRNA level. Second, even though the pattern of methylation is different in young and in old cells, methylation might have no major impact on the XPD promoter’s transcriptional activity. Instead, other regulatory mechanisms such as microRNA might be responsible for controlling the XPD mRNA level. Which hypothesis is true should be verified by in vitro studies.

CC genotypes of the Lys751Gln polymorphism are significantly less common in centenarians than in young subjects, while the frequencies of the Arg156Arg and Asp312Asn polymorphisms are not significantly associated with aging. The Lys751Gln polymorphism is located within C-terminal domain (CTD) of XPD, outside of its helicase or ATPase domains. However, both p53 protein and the p44 subunit of the core TFIIH associate with CTD of XPD, modulating XPD’s helicase activity. In addi- tion, XPD stabilizes the quaternary structure of TFIIH. Therefore, the Lys751Gln variants might differentially ‘respond’ to p53 or p44 binding, and/or differentially affect stability of TFIIH (Coin et al. 1998; Schultz et al. 2000). Comparison of the XPD genotypes at codon 751 with DNA repair efficiency showed that carriers of the Lys-encoding A allele at position 751 had a significantly higher number of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-induced DNA adducts, X-ray induced single stranded DNA breaks, double stranded DNA breaks and chromatid aberrations compared to carriers of the Gln-encoding C allele, indicating that the Lys variant is associated with the decreased DNA repair activity of XPD (Lunn et al. 2000; Vodicka et al. 2004; Naccarati et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2008). In agreement with previous findings, the most chromatid breaks were found in elderly carriers of the Lys/Lys variants of the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism. This polymorphism was also significantly associated with the level of cells with micronuclei (Kazim´ırova´ et al. 2009). On the other hand, Laine´ and co-workers found that this

The amplified 377 bp fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T vector. Three clones obtained from each person were sequenced.

capacity and on basal transcription (Laine´ et al. 2007). The DNA repair capacity is crucial for vulnerability to cancerogenesis, therefore, the XPD polymorphisms were extensively studied in cancer patients. Results regarding the Lys751Gln polymor- phism are relatively consistent: if any significant positive association with cancer risk is present, it usually is the CC genotype (Gln/Gln) that promotes cancer development. Such unfavorable association was shown, for example, for breast (Justenhoven et al. 2004; Terry et al. 2004), lung (Spitz et al. 2001; Kiyohara and Yoshimazu 2007; Hung et al. 2008), esophagus (Liu et al. 2007; Tse et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008) cancers, melanoma (Millikan et al. 2006; Li et al. 2006) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Wang et al. 2008). Such findings are inconsistent with the functional data described above, that shows either that the Lys751Gln polymorphism does not influence protein function (Laine´ et al. 2007) or that it’s the Lys/Lys, not Gln/Gln phenotype, which is associated with altered DNA repair function of XPD (Lunn et al. 2000; Vodicka et al. 2004; Naccarati et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2008; Kazim´ırova´ et al. 2009). If it is true, the reason for such a discrepancy is currently unknown. At this stage, our finding is consistent both with in vitro and with clinical findings: the decreased frequencies of function- impairing AA and cancer-prone CC genotypes of the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism promote longev- ity thanks to efficient DNA repair and lower risk of developing life-threatening disease.

The study has several limitations. First one is the relatively small number of individuals subjected to promoter methylation analysis and that only three clones from each individual were analyzed. Blood mononuclear cell fraction consists of different cell types and, therefore, cell type-specific age-related methylation changes could be missed. Second, the XPD polymorphism frequencies were analyzed only in young and in centenarian age groups, while the results are usually more convincing if additional group of intermediate age is also tested. Unfortu- nately, we were not able to collect group of this age large enough to perform statistical analysis. Third, the study groups subjected to polymorphism analysis differed with respect to sex distribution: while in young controls males/females ratio was 1/0.8, in centenarians it was 1/6.8. However, to our knowl- edge, no sex-related differences in XPD function were ever reported.

To sum up, in this work we show for the first time that the XPD promoter methylation pattern changes with age in human blood mononuclear cells and that the changes are already present at middle age. We also show that the amount of XPD mRNA decreases with progressing age and that the Lys751Gln poly- morphism affecting protein function is associated with aging.

In addition, results regarding the role of this polymorphism in carcinogenesis are quite inconsis- tent, showing an association between the A variant genotype (encoding Asn) either with decreased (Lovatt et al. 2005; He et al. 2008) or, more commonly, with increased (Hu et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2008; Gangwar et al. 2009) risk of cancer development. Data regarding the Arg156Arg poly- morphism are sparse and also inconsistent: the presence of the A allele was correlated with both increased (Harth et al. 2008) and with decreased (Lovatt et al. 2005) cancer risk. We think it is likely that these polymorphisms do not play a ‘universal’ role in cancer pathogenesis. Our results showing that
