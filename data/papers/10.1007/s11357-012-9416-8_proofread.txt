Abstract:
The study investigates genetic variations in genes that regulate energy homeostasis, damage repair, and signaling response to environmental changes or external signals that are critical in modulating the lifespan of organisms. The two-stage case-control study was performed in two independent sets of long-lived individuals from Calabria (Italy). In stage 1, 317 SNPs in 104 genes were analyzed in 78 cases (median age 98 years) and 71 controls (median age 67 years). In stage 2, 310 candidate SNPs identified in stage 1 were analyzed in an independent sample composed of 288 cases (median age 92 years) and 554 controls (median age 67 years). Two SNPs, rs282070 located in intron 1 of the MAP3K7 gene, and rs2111699 located in intron 1 of the GSTZ1 gene, were significantly associated with longevity in stage 2. Both genes are implicated in the cellular response to internal and external environmental changes, playing a crucial role in inflammation processes that accompany aging. The study confirms that long-lived subjects have genetic variants that allow them to optimize cellular responses and better deal with environmental and internal stresses.

Introduction:
Over the decades, developed societies have experienced a gradual increase in life expectancy, sharply increasing the percentage of elderly people in the population. This has led to an interest in understanding how individuals achieve a long and healthy life. Most gene-longevity association studies have so far focused on a single or a few candidate genes. However, given the complexity of the longevity trait, a single-locus approach may not be suitable as each locus is likely to exert a small effect on the trait. Thus, approaches have been developed that take into account complex traits caused by an intricate pattern of genetic variants where epistatic effects may be not negligible. Recent technological improvements in genotyping technology have made whole genome genotyping more accessible. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are at present widely used to find genetic variants contributing to variation in human lifespan. Along with GWAS, studies that consider candidate biochemical pathways consisting of many biologically related genes and a minimal number of tagging SNPs that efficiently capture all the common genetic variation in the assayed genomic region are also being routinely used. Family-based studies have demonstrated the existence of an important familial and genetic component of longevity. The offspring of long-lived subjects have a significant survival advantage and a higher probability to have been or to become long-lived. Twin studies found that approximately 25% of the overall variation in human lifespan can be attributed to genetic factors, which become more relevant at advanced ages. 

The study analyzed 317 SNPs in 104 selected genes involved in longevity pathways, including DNA repair, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, metabolism of xenobiotics, insulin/IGF-1, and neuromodulation. A first sample (stage 1) was used to test all selected SNPs, and only those showing some hint of association were subsequently retested in a second sample (stage 2), thus reducing the number of association tests.

Materials and methods:
The study recruited a stage 1 sample between 1994 and 1997 in Calabria (southern Italy) that included 149 unrelated subjects of which 78 were considered as cases (age ≥90 years; median age, 98 years; 36 males and 42 females) and 71 as controls (age <90 years; median age, 67 years; 39 males and 32 females). A stage 2 sample was recruited subsequently between 2005 and 2008, also in Calabria, that included 842 unrelated subjects of which 288 were cases (age ≥90 years; median age, 92 years; 125 males and 163 females) and 554 were controls (age <90 years; median age, 67 years; 277 males and 277 females). The chromosomal region encompassing the candidate genes was identified through databases. The gene region was defined as the region from up to 5 kbp upstream of the transcription start site to up to 5 kbp downstream of the transcription stop site, allowing no overlap with the neighboring genes. In the choice of candidate SNPs, different online databases were used. Younger subjects were contacted through general physicians, while subjects older than 90 years were identified by screening population registers in different municipalities distributed across the entire Calabria region. All participants gave written informed consent before processing their data.

5. "neuromodEnrolling in the study, the healthy status of subjects was confirmed by a medical visit conducted by a geriatrician who administered a validated questionnaire (available at http://biologia.unical.it/echa/results.htm) to collect sociodemographic information, evaluate physical and cognitive status, medications, and information on past common diseases. Subjects with dementia and/or neurological disorders were excluded. During the visit, peripheral venous blood samples were taken, and white blood cells from blood buffy coats were used as a DNA source. SNP selection was based on criteria such as minor allele frequency (MAF) >10% in Caucasians, coding SNPs, SNPs with potential functional impact (non-synonymous SNPs, SNPs located in potential regulatory regions), and SNPs previously identified in relevant association studies. Tagging SNPs were selected using the Tagger program within Haploview (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/; http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/tagger/; de Bakker et al. 2005), resulting in 317 SNPs in 104 genes involved in the aforementioned pathways. The complete list of genes, SNPs, and relevant information is provided in Supplementary Table S1.

Genotyping was carried out using a microarray technique based on arrayed primer extension (Kurg et al. 2000) for stage 1 samples and an allele-specific PCR-based KASPar SNP genotyping system (KBiosciences, Hoddesdon, UK) (Cuppen 2007) for stage 2 samples. Genotyping quality control procedures included duplicates and positive/negative controls in each assay reaction.

Candidate genes were chosen from genetic pathways related to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, metabolism of xenobiotics, insulin/IGF-1, and neuromodulation based on their biological relevance and published reports indicating their involvement in aging and longevity in either model organisms or humans. Online databases such as Pubmed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and GenAge (http://genomics.senescence.info/genes)/ were employed, and pathway analysis tools such as Biocarta (http://www.biocarta.com/) were used. 

After genotype calling, datasets underwent a quality control (QC) phase to check for errors at the genotypic level. SNPs were excluded if they had significant deviation, high missingness rate, or low minor allele frequency. The cleaned dataset was then analyzed for association with longevity using the chi-square test, with each genotypic variable coded with respect to dominant, recessive, and heterozygote disadvantage/advantage models. The maximum of these three chi-square values was used as a measure of association between the polymorphism and the analyzed phenotype.

In stage 2 analysis, 31 selected SNPs were genotyped in additional samples, and two SNPs were excluded due to high missingness rate. The cleaned dataset was analyzed for association with longevity using the chi-square test, and two observed associations remained statistically significant after Bonferroni's correction: rs282070 (p value = 1.1103) and rs2111699 (p value = 1.4103). For rs282070 located in MAP3K7 gene, subjects carrying the C allele showed an increased chance to attain longevity; for rs2111699 located in GSTZ1 gene, subjects carrying two copies of the G allele showed an increased chance to survive at very old age.

Second-order SNP-SNP interactions were captured using the model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MB-MDR) method developed by Calle et al. (2010). Logistic regression analyses were performed to define the nine possible genotypic combinations as high (H), low (L), or no risk (0). The significance for the epistatic effect was based on the minimum between PH and PL (MIN.P), and the significance of a specified model was assessed through a permutation test on the maximum Wald statistic. No significant differences remained after Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing.Multiple testing of different genetic models obtained by the proposed permutational approach.

Discussion:

Considered a crucial factor in the cascade of intracellular events initiated by environmental and/or physiological stressors, aging regulation may be important for cells to survive or die. However, although several components of MAPK signaling pathways play important roles in the regulation of cellular senescence (Maruyama et al. 2009; Debacq-Chainiaux et al. 2010) and have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases (Kim and Choi 2010), no data have yet been documented about the influence of MAP3K7 on human aging and longevity.

The results of our study provide the first evidence of such an influence with the rs282070-C allele positively affecting longevity in a dominant manner. In this study, we investigated possible associations between longevity and 317 SNPs in 104 candidate genes involved in the regulation of aging-related biological pathways using a two-stage approach. To improve the efficiency of this study design, we used a robust test that is powerful when the underlying genetic model is unknown, and that was successfully applied to genome-wide association studies (Zheng et al. 2007; Sladek et al. 2007).

We found that two SNPs, rs282070 on intron 1 of MAP3K7 gene and rs2111699 on intron 1 of GSTZ1 gene, were significantly associated with survival at advanced age after Bonferroni's correction. GSTZ1 is also implicated in the cellular response to environmental insults. GSTZ1 is a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) superfamily of multifunctional enzymes which are involved in cellular detoxification, via conjugation with glutathione (GSH), of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds, and various reactive products generated under oxidative stress. Diverse cellular functions, ranging from apoptosis to cell survival, are also modulated by GSTs (Nebert and Vasiliou 2004; Hayes et al. 2005; Laborde 2010).

The GSTs comprise three families of genes designed as cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal transferase. The cytosolic GSTZ class of GSTs is expressed in many eukaryotic species, including fungi, plants, insects, and mammals (Board et al. 1997). Human GSTZ1, which is identical to maleylacetoacetate isomerase, catalyzes two distinct reactions: the biotransformation of a range of-haloacids, including dichloroacetic acid, a drinking water contaminant, and the GSH-dependent isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate, the penultimate step in the phenylalanine tyrosine.

MAP3K7 (also known as transforming growth factor-activated kinase-1) is a serine/threonine kinase, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, which plays a crucial role in interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Various stressors and inflammatory cytokines trigger the activation of MAP3K7 which in turn activates key intracellular kinases such as the p38 MAPK, c-jun N-terminal kinase, and I-kappa B kinase complex. These pathways ultimately activate transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1 which are critical regulators of genes of the immune-inflammatory responses (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al. 1999; Sato et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2006; Landstrm 2010).

Studies have also demonstrated that the oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) may induce or mediate the activation of the MAPK pathways, including the one mediated by MAP3K (Son et al. 2011 for a review). In particular, Omori et al. (2008) reported that MAP3K7 regulates the levels of ROS and prevents inflammation. Thus, MAP3K7 may be allelic variants differently affecting the transcriptional rate, but linkage disequilibrium of these SNPs with other functional variants is also possible. This is an interesting issue that needs to be investigated in future research.

Nevertheless, we believe that our results reinforce the view (synthesized in the oxidation inflammatory theory of aging, see De la Fuente and Miquel 2009) that the immune, inflammatory, and stress responses, which are essential components of the body's network of defense against external and internal damaging agents, play an essential role in life span and in age-related phenotypes.

Moreover, analysis of Gstz1-knockout mice provided more insight into the physiological role of Gstz1.
