Gene set analysis of GWAS data for human longevity highlights the relevance of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling and telomere maintenance pathways. Joris Deelen, Hae-Won Uh, Ramin Monajemi, Diana van Heemst, Peter E. Thijssen, Stefan Bhringer, Erik B. van den Akker, Anton J. M. de Craen, Fernando Rivadeneira, Andr G. Uitterlinden, Rudi G. J. Westendorp, Jelle J. Goeman, P. Eline Slagboom and Jeanine J. Houwing-Duistermaat conducted a study using genotyped GWAS data of 403 unrelated nonagenarians from long-lived sibships collected in the Leiden Longevity Study and 1,670 younger population controls. They analyzed 1,021 SNPs in 68 IIS pathway genes and 88 SNPs in 13 TM pathway genes using four self-contained pathway tests (PLINK set-based test, Global test, GRASS and SNP ratio test). Although they observed small differences between the results of the different pathway tests, they showed consistent significant association of the IIS and TM pathway SNP sets with longevity.

Analysis of gene SNP sets from these pathways indicates that the association of the IIS pathway is scattered over several genes (AKT1, AKT3, FOXO4, IGF2, INS, PIK3CA, SGK, SGK2 and YWHAG), while the association of the TM pathway seems to be mainly determined by one gene (POT1). In conclusion, this study shows that genetic variation in genes involved in the IIS and TM pathways is associated with human longevity.

In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits like human longevity, single SNP analysis is still the most applied approach. However, the identified SNPs have small effects and provide limited biological insight. A more appropriate approach to interpret GWAS data of complex traits is to analyze the combined effect of a SNP set grouped per pathway or gene region. There are two main types of methods: the competitive and the self-contained tests. The competitive tests compare the association between a SNP set and trait to a standard defined by the genotyped SNPs outside the SNP set (complement), while the self-contained tests compare the SNP set to a fixed standard that does not depend on the complement.

Human longevity is a complex trait that is assumed to be determined by variation in many genes with small effects. Previous GWAS studies, in which single SNP analyses were performed, have identified only one genome-wide significant locus contributing to survival into old age: APOE. However, the genetic contribution to human lifespan variation, determined in twin studies, is estimated at 25-30%. Although the effect of genetic variation in APOE is relatively large, the heritability of longevity is only partially explained by this variation. Part of the remaining heritability might be explained by functionally related SNPs with small effects, of which the joint effect could not be detected in a single SNP analysis. Testing of SNP sets of candidate pathways for association with longevity would therefore be valuable.

Single SNP analysis has been successful in identifying loci for various quantitative traits and diseases. It became apparent that complex traits are usually determined by many genes with small effects and that results from single SNP analysis provide limited biological insight and only partly explain the genotypic variation of the studied trait. Instead of analyzing single SNPs, the combined effect of a SNP set, grouped per pathway or gene region, can be tested for association with the trait of interest. Such SNP set analysis could be used as an alternative approach for GWAS analysis and should be able to provide additional biological insight into the studied trait.

The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway is considered as a candidate pathway for studying human longevity. It is involved in the adaptation of the organism to its changing environment. When experimentally induced in model organisms like worms, flies, and mice, mutations in genes that play a role in IIS (e.g., homologues of human IGF1R, INSR, IRS1, PI3K, and FOXO) were shown to have a considerable effect on lifespan. Although the IIS pathway is evolutionarily conserved, the complexity of the human IIS pathway is much larger compared to that of model organisms.

Since the amount of tests in SNP set analysis is low compared to single SNP analysis, it requires a lower penalty for multiple testing. Therefore, SNP set analysis is also very suitable in studies with low power for GWAS analysis.considered to be within the window if it was located between 5 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream of the gene boundaries. SNPs were selected based on their location within the window and their minor allele frequency (MAF), which had to be at least 0.01 in the Rotterdam Study (RS) controls. Quality control was performed on the selected SNPs, and only those passing all criteria were included in subsequent analyses.

In this study, we examined the joint effect of genetic variation in the IIS and TM pathways on human longevity using data from the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and younger population controls from the Rotterdam Study (RS). We used several self-contained and competitive tests to analyze associations between SNPs in genes from these pathways and human longevity. Our results provide insights into the complex genetic networks that regulate aging and longevity, and may have implications for future research on interventions to extend healthy lifespan.Defined as an NCBI Entrez Gene (mRNA or RNA) cluster, corresponding to a set of transcripts (RefSeq) for which the alignments can be obtained from the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/), in which all transcripts within a cluster agree on strand and overlap. Due to an overlap of the 10-kb windows, the RS is a prospective population-based study of people aged 55 years and older, which was designed to study neurological, cardiovascular, and locomotor functions. Around IGF2 and INS, two SNPs, rs4320932 and rs7924316, were assigned to both genes. The Global test (http://www.bioconductor.org/help/bioc-views/release/bioc/html/globaltest.html; Goeman et al. 2004), which is capable and powerful for analyzing GWAS data (Chapman and Whittaker 2008; Pan 2009), is used in this study. This test is based on a multiple logistic regression model that uses the phenotype as the response variable and the SNPs in the SNP set as covariates while automatically taking the correlations between SNPs into account. The null hypothesis is tested that none of the SNPs in the SNP set are associated with the phenotype. P values are calculated using a permutation test based on 10,000 permutations.

Statistical Analysis
PLINK set-based test:
In the PLINK set-based test (set-test, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink; Purcell et al. 2007), a single SNP analysis (in our case, a trend test) of the original pathway or gene SNP set is performed. For each SNP set, a mean SNP statistic is calculated from the single SNP statistics of a maximum amount (set-max) of independent SNPs below a certain P value threshold (set-p). If SNPs are not independent, i.e., in case linkage disequilibrium (r2) is above a certain threshold (set-r2), the SNP with the lowest P value in the single SNP analysis is selected. The same analysis is performed with a certain amount (mperm) of simulated SNP sets in which the phenotype status of the individuals is permuted. An empirical P value for the SNP set is computed by calculating the number of times the test statistic of the simulated SNP sets exceeds that of the original SNP set. For the analysis in this study, the parameters were set to set-p 0.05, set-r2 0.5, set-max 99999, and mperm 10,000.

For the comparative approach, 10,000 random SNP sets per pathway SNP set were generated and tested to determine the chance to find a similar-sized SNP set with a comparable or lower P value as compared to the original pathway SNP set.

SNP ratio test:
snpratiotest/; O'Dushlaine et al. 2009) performs a single SNP analysis (in our case, a trend test) of the original pathway or gene SNP set and of similar-sized SNP sets in which the phenotype status of the individuals is permuted. An empirical P value of the SNP set is computed by calculating the ratio between the proportion of SNPs that show an association below a certain P value threshold (p) in the original GWAS dataset and in the simulated GWAS datasets. The amount of significant SNPs in the simulated GWAS datasets is defined as the top n SNPs with the lowest P values, where n is the amount of SNPs with an association below p in the original GWAS dataset. For the analysis in this study, we used the scripts described in SRT_documentation_090310.pdf (http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpratiotest/). For the analysis in this study, p was set to 0.05, and the amount of simulated datasets used was 10,000.

GRASS (http://linchen.fhcrc.org/grass.html; Chen et al. 2010) calculates eigenSNPs for each gene in the pathway SNP set by summarizing the variation of a gene using principal component analysis. Subsequently, one or more of these eigenSNPs per gene are selected using regularized logistic regression to calculate a test statistic for each pathway SNP set. The same analysis is performed with simulated SNP sets in which the phenotype status of the individuals is permuted. The P value per pathway SNP set is calculated by comparing the test statistic of the original pathway SNP set with that of the combined simulated pathway SNP sets. For the analysis in this study, the amount of simulated pathway SNP sets was 10,000.

Global test:
To adjust for multiple testing, the significance level was set at the Bonferroni-corrected nominal P value (which is 0.05/(number of pathway or gene SNP sets tested)).

Abnormalities in growth and/or increased mortality (www.informatics.jax.org; Blake et al., 2011), indicate that these genes are indeed responsible for the growth andthat the pathway as a whole is associated with the trait, rather than relying on a single SNP. This makes SNP set analysis a valuable tool for identifying complex genetic associations. However, it is important to carefully select the pathways and methods used in such analyses, as different approaches can yield contradictory results. In this study, we focused on the IIS and TM pathways and used several different pathway tests to ensure robustness of our findings. We also chose a fixed window of 10 kb for SNP set analysis to take into account regulatory regions surrounding the genes, while acknowledging that this approach may miss some functional SNPs. Our study highlights the potential of SNP set analysis as a complementary approach to single SNP analysis in GWAS, particularly for identifying associations with complex genetic pathways.The combined effect of SNPs within a gene can overcome this problem. Therefore, replication of SNP set analysis is assumed to be more reproducible between genotyping platforms and populations (Luo et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). To support these assumptions, our findings should be replicated in other cohorts.

In conclusion, we have shown that genetic variation in genes involved in the IIS and TM pathways is associated with human longevity. In addition, we provide evidence that different self-contained tests show similar results when applied to candidate-based pathway analysis.
