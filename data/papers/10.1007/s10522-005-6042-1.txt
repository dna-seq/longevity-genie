Abstract

The comparison of genotype frequencies between neonates and elderly populations can aid in the identi- fication of loci, and polymorphisms within those loci, that affect longevity. Here we have compared genotype frequencies of seven polymorphisms at four loci involved in DNA repair between a cohort of newborns (n=290) and a retired population (average age at sampling 70.02 years; n=430) who have suffered a lifetime of DNA damage from normal, metabolic processes, and on whom selection on DNA repair gene variants may be expected to have acted. No differences in genotype frequencies at the four SNP loci were seen, indicating that there is no evidence of association with longevity in this population. Significant differences in frequency of certain repeat sizes at three microsatellite loci were detected. How- ever, since there is no known functional consequence of these repeat lengths, the action of selection cannot yet be ascribed.

Introduction

over 400 polymorphisms have been identified in 80 of these genes that have been screened for variation (Mohrenweiser et al. 2003). Non-synon- ymous polymorphisms can have functional con- sequences (Mohrenweiser et al. 2003; Savas et al. 2004) and such polymorphisms could therefore alter the ability to repair DNA damage.

Our genetic material is under continual assault from extrinsic genotoxic agents and intrinsic met- abolic processes (Burcham 1999; Marnett 2000; Marnett and Plastaras 2001; Bohr 2002). Thus, as they age, people will have to contend with a lifetime of increasing exposure to DNA damag- ing agents. To cope with this barrage of DNA damage there are a number of DNA repair path- ways that are responsible for its detection and re- pair (Hoeijmakers 2001; Slupphaug et al. 2003). Base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) all contrib- ute to the repair of oxidative DNA damage (Slupphaug et al. 2003). Over 115 genes so far have a recognised role in DNA damage recogni- tion and repair (Ruttan and Glickman 2002) and

sure to DNA damaging agents is reflected in age-related increases in somatic mutations in both nuclear (Akiyama et al. 1995; Barnett and King 1995; Morley 1998; Jones et al. 2002) and mitochondrial DNA (Chinnery et al. 2002) and in chromosomal translocations (Ramsey et al. 1995; Lucas et al. 1999; Whitehouse et al. 2005). This increase in mutational events can contribute to the ageing process through cell and tissue degradation, malignancy and an increasing loss of genome integrity (Vijg 2000).

genes of either the BER pathway (XRCC1 R194W, R399Q and a [AC] microsatellite in the n 3¢ UTR of XRCC1), the HR pathway (XRCC3 T241M and a [AC] microsatellite in intron 3 of n XRCC3) or the NHEJ pathway (XRCC4 I134T, and a [GAPyA] microsatellite located 120 kb 5¢ n of XRCC5) between a newborn population and an aged population in order to establish whether polymorphism frequency differences, that may be attributable to selection, can be detected.

defective DNA repair proteins age prematurely (Hasty et al. 2003; Hasty 2005) reflecting the role of genetic determinants in the ageing process. Furthermore, a recent review of population data on DNA repair gene polymorphisms indicates that some common variants reduce DNA repair capacity, thus providing support for the role of DNA repair genes in determining disease suscep- tibility (Ruttan and Glickman 2002). It may therefore be expected that the presence of polymorphisms resulting in sub-optimal repair could effectively decrease lifespan. As a corollary to this, if DNA repair gene polymorphisms do indeed have an impact on life expectancy, then aged populations should present differing geno- type distributions from newborns since there would be an age-related selective effect on indi- viduals with reduced DNA repair capacity and this would manifest as a decreased frequency of sub-optimal DNA repair gene variants in an elderly population.

Materials and methods

Study populations

Umbilical cord blood samples from an unselected newborn population (n=290) were collected un- der the auspices of the North Cumbria Commu- nity Genetics Project (NCCGP), a DNA banking project which collected samples from pregnant mothers and neonates from consecutive pregnan- cies between 1996 and 2003 at the West Cumber- land Hospital, Whitehaven (Chase et al. 1998). Of these 290, 151 (52%) were male. Blood samples were taken, with informed consent, from retired male radiation workers previously employed at the Sellafield nuclear facility (n=430) as part of a separate study (Tawn et al. 2004; Wilding et al. 2005). Mean age at sampling within this group was 70.02 years (range 43.13–89.67 years). The two populations were drawn from the same geo- graphical area and composed predominantly of British Caucasians.

variants hypothesised to be associated with in- creased longevity (reviewed in De Benedictis et al. 2001; Bessenyei et al. 2004; Lewis and Brunner 2004). These are typically either genes conferring susceptibility to age-related diseases or genes in- volved in cellular maintenance and repair (Lewis and Brunner 2004). Most studies have considered genes of the first type and, although studies have been made of polymorphisms in cellular detoxifi- cation genes (De Benedictis et al. 1998; Taioli et al. 2001; Christiansen et al. 2004; Pesch et al. 2004), with the exception of the investigation of polymorphisms within the BER protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) (De Benedic- tis et al. 1998; Muiras et al. 1998; Cottet et al. 2000), none of these have been DNA repair gene variants. Although PARP activity is greater in elderly individuals, no association has been found for single nucleotide polymorphisms within the PARP gene and longevity (De Benedictis et al. 1998; Cottet et al. 2000) or for an [AC] repeat in n the promotor sequence (Muiras et al. 1998).

DNA was extracted from blood using standard methods. Ethical approval was obtained from the West Cumbria Local Research Ethics Committee.

Genotyping analysis

Seven polymorphisms in four DNA repair genes were genotyped: 2 SNPs and 1 microsatellite in XRCC1 of the BER pathway, 1 SNP and 1 mi- crosatellite within XRCC3 of the HR pathway, 1 SNP in XRCC4 and 1 microsatellite in XRCC5 both components of the NHEJ pathway. Meth- ods for the R194W and R399Q SNPs in XRCC1 followed the method of Lunn et al. (1999), XRCC3 T241M was as described by Shen et al. (1998) and the I134T SNP in XRCC4 was

Results

genotyped utilising the method of Relton et al. (2004). An [AC] repeat in the 3¢ UTR of n XRCC1, an intronic [AC] repeat in XRCC3 and n a [GAPyA] repeat situated 120 kb 5¢ of XRCC5 n were amplified using the primers of Price et al. (1997) with fluorescently tagged primers as described by Wilding et al. (2005). Briefly, fluor- escently tagged multiplex PCR products were separated on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser and allele sizes converted to repeat lengths based on allele size as described by Price et al. (1997) At least 10% of all genotyping was randomly under- taken in duplicate with no discrepancies found.

Genotype and allele frequencies are given in Table 1 for the four SNPs. Genotypes for two newborn samples and four retired workers were not available due to failure to amplify PCR product in any reaction. All four SNP polymor- phisms were found to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

SNP genotype frequencies were not different between the male and female newborns (the gen- der of one individual was not available and therefore this individual was excluded from this analysis) thus, these were combined for assessing the association with age (data not shown). There is no evidence for differing gene frequencies between the newborn cohort and the retired worker population as evidenced by the v2 test results (Table 1).

Statistical analysis

undertaken according to standard methods. Comparison of newborn and retired worker genotype frequencies at the 4 SNP loci was undertaken using v2 analysis. The distributions of microsatellite repeat length frequencies between the newborn population and the aged populations were first compared using the log likelihood ratio test utilising S-plus. Where sig- nificance was encountered, numbers of individual repeats were compared using Fisher’s exact test. Due to multiple comparisons, significance levels were adjusted using the sequential Bonferonni

Distributions of repeat lengths at the three microsatellite loci are shown in Figure 1. Repeat lengths in the XRCC1 microsatellite ranged from 9 to 24, XRCC3 repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 22 and XRCC5 repeat lengths ranged from 14 to 18+2. The XRCC5 microsatellite is a tetrameric repeat, however, a small proportion of alleles (designated n+2) had additional 2 bp repeats (Price et al., 1997). Log likelihood ratio tests identified significant differences in the repeat dis- tribution between newborns and aged individuals

effect at such loci utilising this approach, the polymorphisms under study must have functional significance. In vitro studies have indicated that cells homozygous for the XRCC1 194W or 399Q have reduced DNA repair capacity (Wang et al. 2003; Takanami et al. 2005), and analysis of pro- tein function (based on amino acid sequence) predicts that the XRCC1 R399Q and XRCC3 T241M SNPs do have functional consequence for the protein product (Savas et al. 2004). The evidence from epidemiological studies is mixed, some studies indicate that some of the studied SNPs influence cancer risk (Goode et al. 2002; Ruttan and Glickman 2002; Zhu et al. 2003; Savas et al. 2004), e.g. for XRCC1 R194W a reduced risk of various types of cancer is associ- ated with the W allele (paradoxically, considering

In the current study we have identified significantly different frequencies of certain inher- ited microsatellite sizes between newborns and aged individuals. However, these did not involve repeat sizes previously associated with pheno- typic effects (Price et al. 1997) and therefore we are not able to ascribe any functional significance to this at this time.

the in vitro evidence), whilst results for XRCC1 R399Q and XRCC3 T241M are inconsistent (Goode et al. 2002). The inconclusiveness of the genetic epidemiological evidence is likely due to the complex polygenic nature of any underlying genetic association. In addition, for the studied microsatellite loci, unusually large or small alleles are associated with clinical radiosensitiv- ity (Price et al. 1997) and hence may have sub- optimal DNA repair rates. It should be noted that no functional significance has yet been attributed to XRCC4 I134T. Although the poly- morphisms studied are in loci coding for pro- teins involved in repairing damage induced by metabolic by-products we find no evidence for dif- fering gene frequencies between neonates and our aged population. This suggests that in this case ei- ther the selective force is not strong enough to produce a detectable effect, or that these polymor- phisms are not of significance in this context. We note that many gene-longevity association studies examine centenarians as these are survivors lack- ing genetic variants associated with premature mortality (Lewis and Brunner 2004). Thus, it may be that our cases, although retired, were too young for a detectable effect. In support of this, it is of interest that, in an extension of an earlier study (King et al. 1994), the previously reported trend of an age-related increase in somatic HPRT mutations did not extend to a further group of 75–80 year-old individuals with this group having a lower frequency than a group aged 65–69 years (King et al. 1997). This would imply that it is only at this more advanced age that those having low frequencies of somatic mutations, and hence an efficient DNA damage recognition and repair sys- tem, are at a selective advantage. However, we are aware of the healthy worker effect whereby only healthy individuals pass the screening procedures associated with employment (Baillargeon 2001), and this is an important consideration when retired workers are studied. Such an effect could act as a surrogate selective process acting to mag- nify any age-related differences.
