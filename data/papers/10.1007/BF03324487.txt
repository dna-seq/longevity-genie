INTRODUCTION

ABSTRACT. Background and aims: The objective of this study was to examine the association between an ag- ing indicator previously defined from a nationwide pop- ulation study, and lipids and apolipoproteins, angiotensin converting enzyme, paraoxonase activities, and six can- didate genes related to the aging process. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-six healthy Caucasian men (69.8±4.0 years) were included in the study. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein A1, B and E concentrations, and the activities of paraoxonase, arylesterase, and angiotensin- converting enzymes were determined by standardized lab- oratory methods. A multiplex assay was used to genotype the studied polymorphisms: apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, paraoxonase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reduc- tase, cystathionine β-synthase and angiotensin-convert- ing enzymes. Results: Paraoxonase polymorphism at codon 192 (Gln/Arg) was the only one significantly as- sociated with the aging indicator, Gln homozygotes be- ing more advanced in aging compared with Arg allele car- riers. It was also observed that the aging indicator was positively correlated with serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, and neg- atively with the activities of basal and stimulated paraox- onase and arylesterase. Multiple regression analysis showed that triglycerides and basal paraoxonase activi- ty explain 13.6% of the variance of the aging indicator. Conclusions: Triglyceride concentration and paraox- onase gene and activities may contribute to the aging pro- cess. Taking into account the smallness of the sample size, and the poor level of significance due to the im- plication of paraoxonase polymorphism at codon 192, these results need to be verified in further studies on a

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is age-related and a leading cause of death worldwide. Elderly individuals who have avoided CVD should possess a protective and biological background in both genetic profiles and plasma constituents against CVD. Consequently, many studies have investigated genetic polymorphisms and serum vari- ables associated with CVD in a general healthy elderly population to search for the biological factors contribut- ing to successful aging (1, 2). Therefore, we chose to ex- amine the associations between lipids, apolipoproteins, ACE and PON activities, six common bi-allele polymor- phisms, and the aging indicator (AI), representing the dif- ference of biological age (BA) from chronological age (CA). The studied candidate genes are apolipoprotein (apo) E, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), paraoxonase (PON), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genes (MTHFR), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and angiotensin-convert- ing enzymes (ACE). The polymorphisms of these genes are: apoE at codons 112/158 (ε2, ε3, ε4 alleles), ACE (Alu insertion/deletion alleles, I/D), MTHFR (Ala222Val or 677C/T), PON (Gln192Arg), LPL (Ser447Ter) and CBS (Ile278Thr).

ApoE is one of the major proteins of several lipoprotein particles and plays a central role in lipoprotein metabolism. Human apoE gene is located on chromosome 19 and has three common alleles, designated as ε2, ε3, ε4, encoding three major apoE isoforms, E2, E3 and E4. The difference in these three isoforms lies in the substitution of amino acid at codons 112 and 158 (3). In comparison with the most common isoform E3, E2 is associated with higher con- centrations of apoE and triglycerides (TG) and lower total cholesterol (TC), whereas E4 is related to lower concen- trations of apoE and TG, and higher TC in plasma in Eu- ropean populations (3). Many studies have confirmed that the ε4 allele is a genetic risk factor for both CVD (4)

and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (5) with unfavored longevity (6), whereas ε2 is regarded as a protective factor resulting in longevity, according to a French centenarian population study (7), although 1% of apoE ε2/ε2 carriers suffer from hypertriglyceridemia (3). ACE is an enzyme which catalyzes the generation of angiotensin II and also inactivates bradykinin, the two peptides playing a key role in modu- lating vascular tone. Serum ACE levels are under genetic control, and up to 50% of the variation is due to the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene, highest concentrations be- ing found in DD homozygous (8). Although ACE D allele has been proposed as a genetic risk marker for CVD (9), this allele was once found to be frequent in centenarians but later ruled out (7). Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for CVD. Genetic mutation in MTHFR and CBS genes may account for reduced enzyme activities and el- evated plasma homocysteine levels (10). LPL is an enzyme mediating the TG hydrolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL in the circulation. Several polymorphisms have been identi- fied at its gene locus, and the polymorphism at position 447 (Ser→Ter) has been found to be associated with serum TG concentration and/or CVD (11). The PON gene is polymorphic, and the common mutation is re- sponsible for (Gln→Arg) amino acid substitution in position 192 of the protein, the Gln isoform being associated with low serum paraoxonase activity, whereas the Arg iso- form is associated with high activity and quicker peroxide hydrolysis. Earlier studies have demonstrated an associa- tion between this polymorphism and CVD. This relation- ship may be partly related to the association with lipid and lipoprotein in HDL (12), which suggests that serum paraoxonase contributes to the ability of HDL to attenuate oxidative changes (13).

posed of 256 men aged 69.8±4.0 (range 53-86) years. Subjects were unrelated and free of chronic diseases and known pathological states. Clinical measurements such as weight, height, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were systematic measurements of the general health exami- nation provided by CMP; body mass index (BMI) was calculated by Quetelet’s formula: weight/height2 (kg/m2).

Laboratory procedures

For biological measurements of serum and genomic DNA extraction, venous blood was collected from supine subjects by venipuncture after overnight fasting. Sera were frozen in liquid nitrogen (-196°C) until analysis. Serum TC, TG and glucose were measured using standard enzy- matic methods (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) automated on an AU 5021 apparatus (Olympus-Merck, Nogent-sur- Marne, France). Determination of serum apoE concentra- tion was performed by immunoturbidimetry on a Cobas-Mi- ra (Roche-Diagnostics, Meylan, France) using reagents supplied by Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). HDL-cholesterol was measured by the phospho- tungstate method with reagents supplied by Roche- Boehringer (Meylan, France), followed by measurement of TC on the same Cobas-Mira as above. Serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], apoA1 and apoB were determined by im- munonephelometry on a Behring nephelometer analyzer, with Dade-Behring reagents (Paris la Défense, France). Serum PON activities and serum ACE activity were mea- sured on a Cobas-Fara analyzer (Roche-Boehringer, Mey- lan, France). Of the two, the former used 1 mM paraoxon and the latter 0.76 mM synthetic substrate furylacryloyl- phenylalanylglycyl-glycine as substrates (15, 16). The activity of arylesterase was assessed using 1 mM phenylacetate as substrate on a Uvikon 943 double beam UV/VIS spec- trophotometer (Kontron, France) according to the method of Eckerson et al. (15). The basal activity of PON was called PON , and the NaCl-stimulated activity of PON, (1) PON . Hematological data, such as mean globular volume (2) of red blood cells (MGV) and hemoglobin, were measured

An association study is an acceptable method of in- vestigating the biological determinants of human longevi- ty (7). However, new methods still need to be sought, since there are not many healthy centenarians available to compose a large sample. Thus, we first developed a sta- tistical model estimating an individual’s theoretical age based upon biological parameters, as an indicator of bi- ological (rather than chronological) aging (14). This indi- cator was applied to evaluate whether the specific alleles of these six candidate genes and the studied serum con- stituents were associated with early aging in a healthy French sample population.

Determination of genetic polymorphisms

Nuclear blood cells of EDTA blood samples were stored at -80°C until DNA extraction, according to the method of Miller et al. (17). The common apoE polymorphism was de- termined by HhaI digestion following polymerase chain re- action (PCR), with the method of Hixson and Vernier (18). ACE I/D polymorphism genotyping was performed according to Evans et al. (19). Genotyping MTHFR C677T was done according to Frosst et al. (20). Then these three DNA polymorphism determinations were verified by the multiplex assay of Cheng et al. (21). In addition, three other genotypes were determined by this assay: C→G mutation (Ser447→Stop codon) in exon 9 of the LPL

METHODS

Subjects

The sample population came from the Centre de Médecine Préventive (CMP) in Nancy (France), where subjects were consecutive attenders for health screening ev- ery five years. They were recruited between September 1996 and October 1998 according to the possibility of da- ta collection, and all subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion in this study. The sample population was com-

AI is the difference i between BA and CA (AI= BA – CA). By construction, AI is independent of age: its mean is zero, whatever the age, in the reference group used to estimate the regression co- efficients. The following variables were used to define BA: hearing loss; WHR; SBP; number of healthy teeth; serum glucose concentration; serum total cholesterol concen- tration (TC); mean globular volume (MGV) of red blood cells; and hemoglobin value.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed by BMDP® statis- tical software (University of California, Los Angeles). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the associations between AI and genetic polymorphisms, concentration of lipids and apolipoproteins, and activities of ACE and PON. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the relationships between AI and serum con- stituents. The multiple comparison test of Tukey and Scheffé was used to assess differences in mean values of AI for each candidate gene. A p-value of 0.05 was re- tained as significant.

RESULTS

The clinical and biological characteristics of the sam- ple population are listed in Table 1. The mean age of the studied sample population (69.8±4.0 years old) was older than 65, the low-limitation age for the elder- ly. All biological and morphological parameters had values consistent with the generally good health of these subjects. The allele frequencies of the six gene polymorphisms were very close to those observed in oth- er French populations and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table 2) (23, 24).

Eight subjects with the apoE genotype were ex- cluded from this study because of the dominant effect of apoE ε2 on apoE ε4 allele (22). Since very few subjects had apoE ε2/ε2 or apoE ε4/ε4 genotypes, subjects were classified into three groups: subjects carrying apoE ε2/ε2 and apoE ε2/ε3 genotypes; subjects with apoE ε3/ε3 genotype; and subjects carrying apoE ε4/ε3 and apoE ε4/ε4 genotypes. We also grouped for LPL 447 polymorphism, subjects having G/G genotype with sub- jects having C/G genotype (since G allele has the same ef- fects on triglyceride concentration), and for PON poly- morphism (codominance of the two alleles), subjects hav- ing Arg/Arg and Gln/Arg genotypes. Serum HDL-C, TG, Lp(a), apoE concentrations, PON activities [PON and (1) PON ] and arylesterase activity were log-transformed (2) to improve normality for statistical testing.

Table 3 shows the mean value of the AI according to genotype. The genetic polymorphism of PON at codon 192 appeared to be significantly associated with the AI (p=0.0486) according to the three genotypes. It was found that the Arg allele is the least frequent and that the value of AI for those heterozygous subjects was outside the value of the AI interval defined for all Gln homozygotes, thus grouping Arg heterozygous and homozygous carri- ers. Comparing the mean value of AI according to the Gln carrier and Arg carrier groups, we found that the p-value was 0.0237. Since a positive value for this indicator meant that aging is advanced and a negative value re- flected that the aging process was retarded, the Arg car- riers (related to high paraoxonase activity) seemed to be

The statistical approach used to define the BA was based on a multiple regression of age by several quanti- tative variables showing a significant evolution with age (14). The BA of one individual was then calculated from this regression equation: BA= a+Σβ (x–g (a)), where x in- i i i i dicates the observed value of variable x for each variable i

more retarded in the aging process than Gln homozygous carriers (related to low paraoxonase activity). Regarding apoE, LPL and MTHFR polymorphisms, results obtained after pooling heterozygous and homozygous subjects, as described in Methods, were not different from those ob- tained in keeping the three most frequent apoE, LPL or MTHFR genotypes. The only observed difference con- cerns PON polymorphism, presenting a co-dominance of the two alleles (Table 3).

coefficients were negative for PON and arylesterase ac- tivities, suggesting that elevated PON activity leads to a de- lay in the aging process, whereas TC, TG and apoB concentrations lead to acceleration (Table 4).

To further quantify the association between the AI and the studied variables, multiple regression analysis was applied to estimate the percentage of variation of the AI explained by serum variables significantly found asso- ciated with the AI value. Only PON basal activity and TG concentration were related to AI variance (Table 5). PON activity alone explained 7.12% of the AI with (1) TG concentration 13.6%.

TC, TG and apoB concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the AI, whereas PON [PON (1) and PON ] and arylesterase activities were significantly (2) and negatively associated with the AI (p<0.05). Regression

The association of TG concentration with the AI found in this study is also a new result. Besides, we re- ported a decrease in the TG concentration in a popu- lation of subjects with AD, when values were com- pared with those of control subjects of the same age (un- published data). This result is independent of the com- mon genetic polymorphism of apoE, and may be linked to the more general nutritional habits and energy metabolism of middle-aged subjects. In contrast, we could not find associations between apoE and ACE polymorphisms with aging in this French sample pop- ulation, as observed in other studies in French cente- narians (1, 7). These authors demonstrated that apoE ε4 is associated with a shorter life expectancy, as this iso- form correlates with increased susceptibility for both CVD and AD, and that apoE ε2 is more frequent in long-lived individuals (1, 7). They also found that the ACE (DD) genotype is associated with increased life expectancy (1), but this finding was refuted by a recent study by Blanché et al. (7).

DISCUSSION

In this study, we used a statistical indicator, AI, to study the association of serum lipid parameters and six ge- netic polymorphisms with aging, in a group of healthy el- derly men around 70 years old. The construction of this aging indicator has been fully described elsewhere (14). The sample population used here was based on a larger study named Stanislas Cohort (25), in which some grand- parents were included. Since not enough women qualified as subjects, we could only use the male group.

Surprisingly, the significant association of PON ge- netic polymorphism at codon 192 with aging was in- teresting, as subjects carrying the Arg allele had a bio- logical age 1.5 years below their chronological age. These results suggest that higher PON activity is better for “successful” aging. This seems clear, since PON is an enzyme bound to HDL sub-fractions and may provide protection essentially through hydroperoxide hydrolysis in the antiatherogenic properties of HDL by avoiding ox- idative lipoprotein modifications (26). However, some re- ports found a relationship between the Arg allele (high PON activity) and higher serum TG and apoB, but low- er TC and LDL-C concentrations. Thus, the respective roles of PON Arg allele and PON activity are complex in association with CVD. Epidemiological studies carried out in healthy subjects, patients with angiographically documented CVD, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients having or not a history of CVD led to over-representation of the Arg allele in CVD patients and in NIDDM patients with CVD (12, 13). Other studies suggest that the Arg allele is associ- ated with increased risk for CVD, whereas others did not show evidence of associations between the Arg 192 Gln polymorphism of PON and either myocardial or CVD risk. However, in this study, we do not show statistical and significant differences in lipid profiles between var- ious PON genotypes (data not shown). The observed as- sociation between PON polymorphism and the mean AI values obtained in each PON genotype may partly be ex- plained by the multiple implications of PON polymor- phism in lipid metabolism and by the new physiological role of PON activity in the hydrolysis of lipid hy- droperoxides generated in lipoproteins upon oxidative

and the AI may be explained by the age difference (about 30 years) between our study and the two above studies on French centenarians. Many studies fail to show an association between MTHFR polymorphism and longevity in European populations (28). However, Heijmans et al. (29) found a decrease in the allele fre- quency of MTHFR 677T in an elderly European original population compared with young controls (4.4 vs 12.2%), and concluded that an association of this gene variant (677T) leads to a risk of mortality 3.7-fold high- er in elderly subjects. Perhaps our sample size pre- vented us from obtaining the same results. Meanwhile, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the asso- ciation of CBS and LPL polymorphisms with aging, and we did not demonstrate any significant associa- tion in this study.

Besides the fact that TC is part of the estimate of BA, significant correlations of TC, TG and apoB concen- trations with the AI may be due to their implication in CVD, which reduces successful aging. However, Kervi- nen et al. (6) found concentrations of TC and LDL-C to be lower in the elderly population. The work of Strand- berg et al. (30) also showed a decreased concentra- tion of TC with age in an elderly population, perhaps ex- plained by less physical activity, or by changes in nutri- tional status, and the lower need for lipids in the metabolism in the elderly population.

We report here that PON polymorphism at codon 192, basal PON activity, and serum concentration of TG are biological determinants of the aging indicator, and suggest that they should be taken into account when studying aging in an elderly male population. It seems that carriers of the Arg allele are more protected against aging than Gln/Gln homozygous subjects. Because of the small- ness of our sample size and the poor level of signifi- cance, these results need to be validated in further studies composed of a larger number of subjects.
