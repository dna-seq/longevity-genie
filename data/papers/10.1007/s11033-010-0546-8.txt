1p13, encoding lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase (LYP), plays a crucial role in the negative control of T lymphocyte activation. Since the age-related change in T-cell signal transduction may be one of the most impor- tant causes of cell-mediated immune response decline with ageing, we performed a population-based association study to test whether the PTPN22 1858C[T (R620W) functional polymorphism affects the ability to survive to old age and to reach even exceptional life expectancy. 892 unrelated healthy individuals (age range 8–106 years, 403 males and 489 females) from central Italy were studied. For both gender, the frequency of PTPN22*T1858 carriers does not differ significantly in nona/centenarians and in octogenar- ians respect to young group. Allele and genotype fre- quencies of age groups were compared to those reported in previously published studied carried out on control indi- viduals with Italic ancestry (N = 1393), further confirming results obtained from our sample population. Overall, our study suggests that PTPN22*T1858 allele is not negatively selected at oldest ages and we speculate that its increased ability to protect individuals against development of infectious diseases may counteract its deleterious effect on immune system leading to autoimmunity.

Introduction

It is widely accepted that cell-mediated immune functions (cytotoxicity, delayed-type hypersensitivity, etc.) decline with age [1, 2]. These age-associated immunological changes render an individual more susceptible to infection and possibly cancer, as well as to age-associated autoim- mune disorders; they may also contribute to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease [3, 4]. Recent evidences suggest that T-cell hypo-responsiveness due to defects of signaling through the T Cell Receptor (TCR) either from healthy elderly subjects or from individuals with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus results in an impaired ability to mount efficient immune responses and to maintain responsiveness to foreign antigens [5]. This implies that a high proportion of auto-reactive T cells might accumulate either intra- thymically or in the periphery. T-cell anergy and differ- ential TCR signaling could thus also be key players in the disruption of tolerance and the onset of autoimmune diseases.

The proliferation and clonal expansion of T lympho- cytes is mostly controlled by interactions between the cytokine IL-2 and its cellular receptor [6] following TCR ligation [7]. It is now well accepted that the induction of IL-2 secretion decreases with age in mice, in rats and in humans [8]. It seems that such defects occur in the trans- duction of mitogenic signals following TCR stimulation. Indeed, recent studies suggest that alterations in, for example, tyrosine kinase activity, intracellular free cal- cium, inositol phosphates, protein kinase C (PKC), and so

central Italy were studied. Information about health status was obtained for all the individuals, and no acute patholog- ical condition was present. Almost all subjects up to age of 65 were recruited in blood donor centers while those over 65 were recruited through family physicians or among guests in homes for the elderly. The population under study was divided into three group: (a) a ‘‘young group’’ ranging from 8 to 70 years (133 males and 145 females, mean age 50.7 ± 15.1), (b) ‘‘Octogenarians’’ ranging from 80 to 89 years. (180 males and 209 females, mean age 83.8 ± 2.7), and (c) ‘‘Nona/centenarians’’ ranging from 90 to 106 years (90 males and 135 females, mean age 93.0 ± 2.8). The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Camerino University.

on, may all contribute to changes in signal transduction with ageing [9–11]. Although the signaling machinery in T cells is extremely complicated and many steps remain to be clarified, the age-related change in T-cell signal transduc- tion may be one of the most important causes of cell- mediated immune response decline with ageing.

mosome 1p13, encoding lymphoid protein tyrosine phos- phatase (LYP), plays a crucial role in the negative control of T lymphocyte activation. LYP is expressed in lymphoid cells, mainly in T lymphocytes where it associates with C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) to form a complex that sup- presses the T-cell receptor signaling kinases LCK and FYN [12, 13]. Recently, a variant of PTPN22 (rs2476601, 1858C[T) has been associated with an increase in risk for the development of multiple autoimmune diseases includ- ing type 1 diabetes (T1D) [14–16], rheumatoid arthritis [17], systemic lupus erythematosus [18], and Graves’s disease [19]. This variant is a single nucleotide change at residue 1858 from C to T, which results in a single amino acid substitution from arginine to tryptophan at position 620 of the Lyp protein (Lyp 620W). Experimental evidence suggests that the disease-associated LYP variant Trp620 prevents the interaction of LYP with CSK [14]. Conse- quently, the T-cell receptor-associated kinases might be able to induce T-cell activation in an uncontrolled manner and this may increase the overall reactivity of the immune system and predispose an individual to autoimmune dis- ease. Noteworthy, it has been demonstrated that homozy- gosity for this variant results in a profound deficit in T cell responsiveness to antigen stimulation. Heterozygosity for the variant allele is associated with reduced responsiveness of CD4? memory T cells, characterized by diminished calcium mobilization, expression of CD25, IL-10 and IL-2 production upon TCR stimulation. Additionally, the pres- ence of the variant allele is associated with an increase in

PTPN22 1858C[T (R620W) genotyping

Genomic DNA extraction from whole blood was carried out by salting-out method [21] and stored at -20(cid:3)C for the gene analysis. For the determination of the PTPN22 alleles, PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed as described previously [14]. Briefly, a fragment of the PTPN22 gene was ampli- fied by PCR using the forward primer 50-TCACCAGCTT CCTCAACCACA-30 and the reverse primer 50-GATAAT GTTGCTTCAACGGAATTTA-30. The C ? T transition at codon 620 (NCBI refSNP ID: rs2476601) creates in the T1858 allele a restriction site for Xcm I. The polymor- phism was identified by Xcm I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) restriction endonuclease digestion of

Each digestion was resolved on 2.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV. Repeated typing was performed in 10% of samples, with identical results in all cases.

Statistical analysis

Indeed, we hypothesized that analysis of the genetic polymorphism of the PTPN22 enzyme associated with an increased risk of autoimmunity could also prove informa- tive as to the possible role of autoimmunity in determining human life expectancy. Therefore, we performed a popu- lation-based study analyzing the PTPN22 1858C[T (R620W) genotype frequencies in 892 healthy individuals ranging from 8 to 106 years.

HWE (Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium) was checked by v2 test. Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) was used to evaluate the differences in genotypic distribution (under a genetic dominant model) between the groups and the strength of association was expressed as odds ratios (O.R.s) with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was set at P \ 0.05. Three-way contingency table analysis was done by a log-linear model according to Sokal and Rohlf [22]. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Power calculations were performed using Quanto ver. 1.2.4. (available at http://hydra.usc.edu/ gxe/), taking into account sample sizes and minor allele frequencies (MAF), genetic dominant model, frequency of octogenarians and nona/centenarians in Italy (available at http://demo.istat.it/pop2010/index.html), and type I error

Results

The distribution of the PTPN22 genotype in population studied is shown in Table 1; the maximum age in males and females in our sample population was 100 and 106 respectively. Only one subject carrier of PTPN22 T*/T* genotype was found. Allelic and genotypic frequencies are in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, regardless of whether males and females are considered together (v2 = 0.15, P = 0.698), or separately (males: v2 = 0.56, P = 0.454; females: v2 = 0.15, P = 0.698). The same situation occurs when age groups were considered (Table 1). For both gender, the frequency of PTPN22*T carriers does not differ significantly in nona/centenarians and in octogenarians respect to young group (Table 1). On the whole, there was a trend toward higher frequencies of PTPN22*T carriers among females (10.2 vs. 7.2%, P = 0.08), but overall, the frequency of *T carriers was not significantly associated with gender in each age group studied. Allele frequencies do not differ significantly among age groups (females v2 = 0.57, P = 0.752; males v2 = 0.33, P = 0.8479). The three-way contingency table analysis by log-linear model confirmed the irrelevant effect of PTPN22 genotype in the determination of life-span expectancy in the population

x = age group; y = PTPN22 genotype (PTPN22 C*/C* PTPN22*T carriers); z = sex

significant differences were reported (Table 3). We also carried out a comparison between the genotype frequencies of octogenarians-nona/centenarians and the pooled geno- type frequency of younger individuals; no significant result was found (octogenarians, O.R. for T* carriers = 1.037, 95% CI 0.693–1.551, P = 0.862; nona/centenarians, O.R. for T* carriers = 1.253, 95% CI 0.800–2.014, P = 0.351), further confirming the results obtained from our study population. Of note, this comparison had sufficient power (0.80) to detect an association with a genotypic relative risk (or odds ratio) B0.80 and/or C1.2, thus excluding a marginal effect of PTPN22 1858C[T SNP on human longevity.

Discussion

Ageing is characterized by a pro-inflammatory status, which could contribute to the onset of major age-related diseases. Indeed, genetic variations in pro- or anti-inflam- matory cytokines were found to influence successful ageing and longevity [24]. These polymorphisms might confer flexibility in the immune response by allowing differential production of cytokines. Cytokine gene polymorphisms have been shown to be involved in the susceptibility,

To further support our results, allele and genotype fre- quencies of younger group were compared with those reported in previously published studied carried out on control individuals with Italic ancestry (age \ 70 years), comprising the re-analysis of our previous data [23]. No

severity and clinical outcome of several diseases [25]. In particular ‘high producer’ alleles of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associated with inflammatory age- related diseases [26] and disability [27], and with a decreased probability to reach extreme longevity [28]. Consequently, it can be hypothesized that anti-inflamma- tory cytokines might be involved in successful ageing and longevity. As the PTPN22 gene product LYP is an impor- tant down-regulator of T lymphocyte activation and PTPN22-knockout mice showed selective dysregulation in the effector/memory T-cell compartment, with hyper-pro- liferation and early signaling responses in re-stimulated T cells [29], we wanted to test whether the PTPN22 1858C[T (R620W) polymorphism was associated with longevity.

Despite the established evidence of the strong negative effect exerted by PTPN22*T1858 allele on immune system, conferring high susceptibility to a large subset of autoim- mune diseases, we report a lack of association of PTPN22 1858C[T polymorphism with human longevity. Thus, the ability to survive to old age, and to reach even exceptional life expectancy, is largely unaffected by the genetically determined efficacy of the PTPN22-based immune response. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the autoimmunity high-risk PTPN22*T1858 allele has been previously associated with a significant protective effect on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [30, 31]. This is an interesting fact since the burden of tuberculosis in the elderly is likely to continue to increase substantially [32].

Therefore, our results suggest that PTPN22*T1858 allele is not negatively selected at oldest ages and its increased ability to protect individual against development of infectious diseases may counteract its deleterious effect on immune system leading to autoimmunity. In conclusion, an excessive reduction of the capacity to cope with an infectious agent might predispose to an overt disease, but the better survival might be obtained by individu- als in which a balanced interaction among pro- and
