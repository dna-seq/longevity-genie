Variations of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene are associated with extreme human longevity. Received: 24 November 2011 / Accepted: 4 April 2012 / Published online: 9 May 2012 # American Aging Association 2012 (3):524-530, 2009). Based on the above study in mice, here we sought to search for AGTR1 variations associated with reduced AT receptor protein levels and prolonged lifespan in humans. AGTR1 was sequenced in 173 Italian centenarians and 376 younger controls. A novel non-synonymous mutation was detected in a centenarian. Two polymorphisms in AGTR1 promoter, rs422858 and rs275653, in complete linkage disequilibrium, were significantly associated with the ability to attain extreme old age. We then replicated the study of rs275653 in a large independent cohort of Japanese origin (598 centenarians and semi-supercentenarians, 422 younger controls) and indeed confirmed its association with exceptional old age. In combined analyses, rs275653 was associated with extreme longevity either at recessive model (P <0.007, odds ratio (OR) 3.57) or at genotype level (P <0.015). Significance was maintained after correcting for confounding factors. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that subjects homozygous for the minor allele of rs275653 had fewer AT R-positive peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells. Moreover, rs275653 was associated with lower blood pressure in centenarians. These findings highlight the role of AGTR1 as a possible candidate among longevity-enabling genes.

Introduction

The phenotype of human longevity has many diverse determinants. Non-genetic factors such as health habits, socioeconomic conditions, diet, and physical activity account for an important part; however, emerging evidence suggests that genetic factors contribute in a major way to variation in human lifespan particularly in populations known for exceptional survival (Sirtori et al. 2001; Bilal et al. 2008). Genetic determinants of longevity were initially reported in small, short-lived organisms including yeast, worm and flies, but a considerable number of these genes turned out to extend lifespan in mammals as well. Among plausible candidates for human longevity, polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E gene have been found to influence lifespan in multiple populations, probably through their association with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia (Corder et al. 1996). More recently, findings in two independent populations documented that polymorphisms in the human forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A) gene, which encodes a key regulator of the insulin/insulin growth factor 1 signaling pathway, were associated with the ability to attain exceptional old age (Flachsbart et al. 2009; Willcox et al. 2008). However, as can be expected for a polygenic trait like longevity, variations of FOXO3A and of other genes in the insulin/insulin growth factor 1 signaling pathway found no or only modest effects on human lifespan (Flachsbart et al. 2009; Willcox et al. 2008; Pawlikowska et al. 2009). Thus, investigations on further candidates with substantial beneficial effects on human lifespan are needed to fully disclose the determinants of human aging.

Materials and Methods

In the Italian group AGTR1 exons, their flanking regions, the 5'- and 3'-UTR regions (including 250 bp of the promoter upstream 5'-UTR) were amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced in the two directions on anABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) was used in this study. Primers (Online Resource 1) designed according to the AGTR1 genomic reference NC_000003, built 37.1, at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Variants are referred to transcript variant 4 (NM_031850) RNA reference sequence and numbering begins with the ATG start codon. For quality control purposes, a 5% random sample was sequenced twice. Moreover, subjects carrying very rare genotypes (<5%) were confirmed by repeating PCR reactions, followed by resequencing of both DNA strands. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that allelic variants in the promoter of AGTR1 are associated with reduced AT R 1 receptor expression levels in peripheral blood neutrophils. In addition, screening of the whole coding region of AGTR1 in an Italian cohort disclosed a novel mutation leading to amino acid substitution in one centenarian. Finally, an association between variants in AGTR1 promoter and diastolic blood pressure in centenarians was found.
 
Methods: For the replication study in the Japanese group, SNP genotyping was performed by TaqMan SNP assay (Applied Biosystems). The genotyping conditions for a cohort of 173 Italian centenarians (between 99 and 106 years of age, mean 100.91 ± 1.7 years) living in Italy were used. Analysis of AT R presence in peripheral leukocytes: Fresh blood samples were processed for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) purification as described (Noris et al., 1999; Noris et al., 1996), labeled with an anti-human AT R antibody (Anti AT-1, N-10, Santa Cruz), followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat F(ab)2 fragment anti-rabbit IgG (eBioscience). To identify the various leukocyte subsets, cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated mAb antibodies against CD45, CD16, CD14, CD3, CD4 (BD Bioscience and Biolegend). The samples were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis using FACSAria cytometer (BD Bioscience). Results were expressed as a percentage of AT R 1 positive cells (percent).
 
Results: In the Italian cohort, exons and putative regions of AGTR1 were sequenced to determine if any gene which may alter the amino acidic sequence or regulation is differently represented in vs. younger controls. Eight previously reported variants (Fig. 1 and Online 2), including a non-synonymous variant leading to amino acid substitution at position 298 (p.Asn298Ser), which was found in a centenarian and not in controls, were identified. This change occurs in the transmembrane domain of AT R and is predicted to be damaging in silico. In addition to the rare variants, ten known SNPs were observed during sequencing of AGTR1, and therefore, their distribution in centenarians and controls was evaluated (Table 1). Of the ten SNPs observed, two were in HW equilibrium and were removed from further analysis. The rs422858 is a dinucleotide change (AG/CC), but for practical reasons here, the major allele AG is defined as A and the CC allele as C (Erdmann et al., 1999). Single-marker analysis in the eight SNPs passed the HW equilibrium test and revealed significantly different rs422858 and rs275653 genotype distributions between centenarians and controls (P<0.004 for both markers, Table 1). Rs422858 and rs275653, located in the promoter region of AGTR1 at 174/173 bp and 113 bp, respectively, are in complete linkage disequilibrium. Under the recessive model, the minor alleles of rs422858 and rs275653 were significantly associated with extreme old age (unadjusted P<0.003; OR 4.55) (Table 1). A significant difference was observed for rs422858 and rs275653 also under the dominant and the additive models, but this difference did not pass the Bonferroni correction.
 
Statistical analysis: Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± SEM. ANOVA and T-tests were used to compare continuous variables. Categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square test. If n<5, exact Fisher test statistics were used. In the presence of a category with 0 frequency, the statistical analyses were performed using Elrm software for R (Zamar et al., 2007). Markers deviating from the Hardy Weinberg (HW) equilibrium in the control population (P<0.05) were excluded from the analysis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were analyzed using SISA statistics.The processed text is:

Introduction:
One of the most long-lived populations is the Japanese, with a high number of centenarians, and the rs275653 and rs422858 SNPs are in complete Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) in both Japanese and Italian subjects.

Results:
The minor allele frequency of rs275653 was lower in the Japanese population (0,084) compared to Italian controls (0,158). The GG genotype was significantly associated with longevity under the recessive and additive models in the Japanese cohort but not with the dominant model or at the allele level.
The GG genotype was enriched in both centenarians' groups from Italy and Japan compared to controls.
FACS analysis showed that individuals homozygous for rs275653 minor allele had significantly lower AT R surface expression on peripheral blood leukocytes than heterozygous or homozygous individuals for the common allele.
Centenarians with GG genotype had lower blood pressure, either systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) or mean arterial pressure (MAP) with respect to centenarians with AA genotype.

Discussion:
The minor allele of rs275653 is associated with longevity in Japanese and Italian populations.
The GG genotype is enriched in both centenarians' groups from Italy and Japan compared to controls.
The rs275653 SNP affects AT R expression on peripheral blood leukocytes.
The GG genotype of rs275653 is associated with lower blood pressure in centenarians.Genetically diverse population. 

Discussion: 

In this study, we have identified a region in the promoter of the human AGTR1 that is associated with extreme longevity. Studies on a test group of Italian centenarians and controls provided evidence of a significant association between SNP variants of AGTR1 and human lifespan. Although studies in short-lived organisms and in human isolated populations with exceptional lifespan have clearly shown that genes play a role in longevity, the specific genetic variants involved are still largely unknown. Evidences in mammals point to a role of genes involved in the major causes of death, i.e. cardiovascular disease, cancer, and brain disease. 

The vasoactive hormone AngII has been involved in organ senescence, and in previous studies, we demonstrated that disruption of the mouse gene encoding for AT R 1A markedly prolonged animal lifespan (Benigni et al. 2009) and protected mice from vascular and cardiac injury.

Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that SNP variations in the AGTR1 promoter can influence protein levels of the corresponding receptor, and that a region including or linked to the AGTR1 promoter could play a role in modulating local RAS system. Since our sequencing-based screening study was confined to the proximal portion of AGTR1 promoter and to coding regions and intron/exon boundaries, the possibility that rs275653 and the linked rs422858 and rs2307085 are in linkage disequilibrium to variants in other regulatory elements in the promoter or in introns cannot be excluded.

Here we demonstrate that in an Italian cohort, the C-variant of rs422858 and the linked G-variant of rs275653 are overrepresented in centenarians with an OR of 4.55 according to the recessive model, in line with what should be expected for a polygenic trait like longevity. Replication of rs275653 genotyping in Japanese cohort, characterized by a large number of centenarians and semi-supercentenarians of homogeneous ethnic origin, confirmed an enrichment of the G-allele in centenarians and its association to longevity according to the recessive model. Combined analyses sustained the association at genotype level. Data of European and Japanese populations from 1000 Genomes and from HapMap databases as well as our results on the Italian group demonstrate that rs275653 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs422858. The absence of the rs275653 GG genotype in our Japanese controls diverges from the data of the small cohort of Japanese subjects in 1000 Genomes database (rs275653 GG genotype: one over 90 subjects). However, comparison of the genotype prevalence in Japanese population of 1000 Genomes and in our Japanese controls failed to evidence any statistical difference both at genotype and at allele level.

The variant of rs422858 belongs to an E-box element which is lost in the presence of the minor allele. Supportive evidence to our genetic data comes from ex vivo findings indicating that the longevity-associated variants have functional consequences on the expression of the corresponding receptor protein on the surface of circulating cells. Indeed, by FACS experiments, we demonstrated that PMNs of subjects homozygous for the minor rs275653 allele (and consequently for the C-variant of rs422858) had a significantly lower percentage of AT R-positive cells with respect to subjects heterozygous and homozygous for the major allele. A similar difference was observed when the CD16+ PMN fraction was analyzed. Consistently, previously reported transfection experiments in adrenal cortical and in vascular smooth muscle cells (Kumar et al. 2005) documented that reporter constructs containing the A rs422858 variant had higher promoter activity than constructs with the minor C-variant, suggesting that this SNP could affect the levels of AT R gene transcription.

Fig. 3 Blood pressure in Italian and Japanese centenarians according to rs275653 genotype. Data are represented as mean SEM. a Diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in centenarians with GG genotype as compared to those AA genotype (additive model, P00.031) or to centenarians with AA and AG genotypes (recessive model, P00.040). G-allele was also associated with reduced DBP (P00.037). SBP and MAP (b and c, respectively) were statistically different in centenarians carrying the rs275653 G-allele (P00.046 and P00.042, respectively).

In both Italian and Japanese centenarians, we observed a statistically significant decreased systolic blood pressure in homozygous for GG rs275653 genotype suggesting that this polymorphism might influence blood pressure. In control subjects, we observed a reduction of SBP in subject homozygous for GG genotype; however, this difference was not statistically significant. It is likely that the wide range of age in the control population may have masked the association between the G-allele ofResults indicate that genetic AGTR1 variants leading to reduced receptor expression may contribute to prolonging human lifespan. These findings are of particular relevance as they disclose AT R as a peculiar pharmacological target for the prevention and treatment of disabilities and diseases that occur with allelic variations in AGTR1 promoter, including the rs422858 major allele, have been associated with hypertension in Caucasian women (Kumar et al. 2005). Very recently, SNPs in the AGTR1 promoter have been associated with the risk of hypertension in Mexicans (Martinez-Rodriguez et al. 2011) and salt sensitivity.
