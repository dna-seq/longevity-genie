frequency (MAF) of rs769449 (APOE) was cantly decreased in the oldest-old, while the MAF rs9923854 (CETP) was significantly enriched. effects were supported when investigating – oldest-old (ages 95 110) and 1,104 middle-aged mans. rs769449 was in modest linkage (R20 0.55) with rs429358 of the APOE-ε 4 and adjusting for rs429358 eliminated the of rs769449, indicating that the association reflects the well-known effect of rs429358. based analysis confirmed the effects of variation APOE and CETP and furthermore pointed to as a longevity gene. In a longitudinal study 11 years of follow-up on survival in the Danes, only one SNP, rs2069827 (IL6), was significantly associated with survival from age 92 0 corrected 0.064). This advantageous effect of the nor allele was supported when investigating a 0 longitudinal cohort (N 563) of oldest-old (age Since rs2069827 was located in a putative tion factor binding site, quantitative RNA studies were conducted. However, no difference in expression was observed between rs2069827 groups. In conclusion, we here support and expand evidence suggesting that genetic variation in CETP, and IL6, and possible HSPA14, is associated human longevity.

Introduction

Approximately 25% of the variation in human lifespan is thought to be caused by genetic variation (Herskind et al. 1996), a contribution considered to be minimal before age 60 years and most profound after age 85 years (Hjelmborg et al. 2006). Candidate genes for longevity encode proteins engaged in different biological processes including lipoprotein metabolism and inflammatory processes (Christensen et al. 2006).

the common genetic variation within candidate genes previously reported to contain lifespan associated poly- morphisms. Furthermore, we expand the study to include the genetic variation of genes belonging to the same functional groups. Of the 16 genes included in this study, only SIRT1 and 3 have previously been investigated by a tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ap- proach in a candidate association study (Flachsbart et al. 2006; Kuningas et al. 2007; Lescai et al. 2009).

We investigate the apolipoprotein E, C3, and A4 genes (APOE, APOC3, and APOA4), all of which are involved in lipoprotein metabolism, believed to pose an effect on longevity (Christensen et al. 2006). The APOE ε 4 haplotype is by far the most validated ge- netic variation and has repeatedly been associated with human longevity (e.g., Asada et al. 1996; Bathum et al. 2006; Deelen et al. 2011; Gerdes et al. 2000; McKay et al. 2011; Nebel et al. 2011; Schachter et al. 1994), whereas one study has found association of rs2542052 in APOC3 with longevity (Atzmon et al. 2006). The APOE polymorphism was recently reviewed in (Seripa et al. 2011). Also involved in lipoprotein metabolism is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp) for which rs5882 in CETP has been reported as a longevity SNP (Barzilai et al. 2003).

Genes encoding proteins engaged in immune regu- latory processes are also key candidates for longevity (reviewed in Jylhava and Hurme 2010). Frequently discussed is the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) and its receptor alpha (IL6R); in IL6, a variable number of − tandem repeat (VNTR) and a 174C/G polymorphism (rs1800795) have been described as associated with longevity (Capurso et al. 2007; Christiansen et al.

2004; Hurme et al. 2005; Rea et al. 2003). Another cytokine gene often suggested is the transforming β growth factor beta 1 gene (TGF 1), which is involved, among others, in regulation of cellular proliferation β and differentiation. In TGF 1, the +915 polymorphism (rs1800471) and a haplotype including rs1800471 have been reported to be of relevance for longevity (Carrieri et al. 2004).

1999; Blanche et al. 2001; Yang et al. 2009), rs1800562 in HFE (Carru et al. 2003; Coppin et al. 2003), and rs180113 in MTHFR (Bladbjerg et al. 1999; Khabour et al. 2009; Hessner et al. 2001; Brattstrom et − al. 1998) and 176C/G in IL6 (Pes et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2001). Furthermore, a few meta-analyses or pooled ε analyses have been published; for APOE 4 and the ACE I/D, insertion/deletion association was supported (McKay et al. 2011; Zajc et al. 2012), while for − the IL6 176C/G polymorphism, a North/South Euro- pean gradient of association was suggested (Di Bona et al. 2009). In any case, the involvement in longevity of the majority of these specific polymorphisms still remains uncertain.

We also explored the heat shock protein (hsp) encoding genes HSPA1A, 1L, and 14, all playing a role in folding of newly translated proteins and in stabilization of proteins against aggregation, processes reported to decrease during aging (Singh et al. 2007). The A/C-110 polymorphism in HSP1A and T2437C in HSP1L have been described to be independently as- sociated with longevity (Altomare et al. 2003; Ross et al. 2003; Singh et al. 2010), as well as in separate haplotypes (Li et al. 2009a; Singh et al. 2010).

The majority of candidate gene studies published to date have investigated only very few polymorphisms in each gene. To more thoroughly examine as much of the known variation in each of these genes as possible, we here apply a tagging SNP approach using a total of 102 tagging SNPs covering the 16 gene regions. With the exception of SIRT 1 and 3 (Flachsbart et al. 2006; Kuningas et al. 2007; Lescai et al. 2009), such an approach has, to our knowledge, not been applied before in a candidate gene study. Moreover, preceding studies – have generally used a case control study design, thus raising concerns of bias introduced by differences in characteristics of cases and controls, for example cohort – effects. Here we apply a case control approach using – two cohorts of 1,089 oldest-old (age 92 93 years) and – 736 middle-aged (age 46 67 years) Danish individuals, as well as a longitudinal approach with 11 years of follow-up survival data of the 1,089 oldest-old. Finally, we include replication data from Dutch and German study populations, as well as exploration of the initial – findings from the Danish case control study in the Danish longitudinal data and vice versa. Thus, the study presented here offers a good opportunity to confirm the putative association of variation in these major candidate

The sirtuins 1, 3, and 6 probably function as intra- cellular regulatory proteins affecting for example IGF1/insulin signaling and DNA repair, although their roles are not entirely clear (Olmos et al. 2011). In SIRT3, a G477T polymorphism (Rose et al. 2003) and a VNTR polymorphism (Bellizzi et al. 2005) have been put forward as longevity polymorphisms.

Finally, we examined three genes not belonging to any of these biological processes but still considered reliable candidates in previous studies: the highly dis- cussed candidate gene angiotensin I-converting en- zyme (ACE), for which the I/D insertion/deletion (tagged by rs4343 (Abdollahi et al. 2008)) has been reported by several authors to be associated with lon- gevity (Arias-Vasquez et al. 2005; Cellini et al. 2005; Frederiksen et al. 2003; Luft 1999; Novelli et al. 2008; Schachter et al. 1994; Zajc et al. 2012); the iron absorption regulatory protein hfe, for which the Cys282Tyr variation (rs1800562) was found to de- crease with age (Bathum et al. 2001; Lio et al. 2002); and, finally, MTHFR, which is of importance for the essential remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, where the C677T (rs1801133) polymor- phism has been suggested as associated with longevity (Stessman et al. 2005; Todesco et al. 1999).

Subjects

A considerable number of the associations men- tioned above could not be replicated in subsequent studies. These studies include rs2542052 in APOC3 (Novelli et al. 2008), rs5882 in CETP (Cellini et al. 2005; Novelli et al. 2008), I/D insertion/deletion in ACE (Agerholm-Larsen et al. 1997; Bladbjerg et al.

Detailed characteristics for the discovery cohorts were previously described in (Soerensen et al. 2010). In

short, the study population of oldest-old were 1,200 participants from The Danish 1905 Birth Cohort Study (Nybo et al. 2001), while the 800 younger controls were singleton participants from the Study of Middle Aged Danish Twins (Skytthe et al. 2002). The survival status information was retrieved from the Danish Central Population Register (Pedersen et al. 2006), and the vital status was followed until death or January 1, 2010. After data cleaning, the final sample size was 1,089 oldest-old and 736 middle-aged individuals. Permission to collect blood samples and usage of register-based information was granted by The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics.

(see Online Resource 1). The chromosomal regions investigated are the gene regions plus 5,000 kb up- stream and 1,000 kb downstream. Tagging SNPs were identified via HapMap consortium database (http:// hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html.en, CEU cohort) and analyzed using the HaploView software (http:// www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview; Barrett et al. 2005). Finally, for optimal genotyping, SNPs known to perform poorly on the Illumina GoldenGate genotyping platform were excluded.

Genotyping

DNA was isolated from blood spot cards using the QIAamp DNA Mini and Micro Kits (Qiagen, Ger- many); genotyping was performed using Illumina GoldenGate technology (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA), and data clean up, data verification, and reproducibility checks were conducted as previously described (Soerensen et al. 2010). In total, 16 SNPs were excluded, leading to 102 SNPs for data analysis. Genotyping in the German and Dutch study popula- tions was performed using Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX®Gold technology (Sequenom®, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA); see the Supplementary Material (Online Resource 1) for details.

Study populations for replication of initial findings

For replication of the initial observations from the – Danish case control study, two German samples of – 1,613 unrelated long-lived individuals (age 95 110) and 1,140 middle-aged controls (mean age 67.2) were used. The participants were identified through local registry offices and from the Federal Administrative Office. They were recruited from the different geo- graphic regions of Germany and were all of German ancestry (Nebel et al. 2005). Approval was received from the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein.

For replication of initial findings from the Danish longitudinal study, the Dutch Leiden 85-plus Study was used. This prospective cohort was initiated in 1997, when all 85-year-old inhabitants of the city Leiden in the Netherlands were invited to participate. The cohort consists of 563 participants, all Caucasians – and members of the 1912 1914 birth cohort recruited from 1997 to 1999 (Bootsma-van der Wiel et al. 2002). The Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden University Medical Centre approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all participants or, in case of severe cognitive impairment, from their guardian.

Whole blood samples were collected, stabilized, and transported in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (Qiagen) − and stored at 80°C. RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen), and the integ- rity and concentration of RNA were determined by the RNA 6000 Nano Kit and a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, USA). Reverse transcription was performed by the high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) taking μ maximum 2 g of purified RNA in a total volume μ of 20 l. IL-6 expression was determined by qPCR using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied biotechnology) in duplex reactions of FAM-labeled IL6 primers (Hs00985637_m) and VIC-MGB- labeled ACTB (beta actin) endogenous control (limited) primers (4326315E). First validation experiments were carried out checking for equal efficiency of the primers in single and duplex reactions with varying cDNA dilutions and by

subsequently determining the dynamic range by μ standard curves. Consequently, 20 l reactions in- μ μ cluding 1 l of each primer and 4 l cDNA sam- ples diluted 1:10 were made in triplicates applying the standard protocol of the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied biotechnology). Thresholds established in the validation experiments were ap- plied, the real-time curves were confirmed, and in case of C values off range, such samples were t excluded.

time of death was put at December 31, 2000, when half of the males and one third of the females in cohort had died. Accordingly, the early/late death 0 was defined as early time of death between (date at intake) and December 31, 2000 (i.e., 0 living to maximum age 95) and late time death after January 1, 2001 (i.e., individuals surviv- to age 95+). Fourteen of the 1089 oldest-old indi- were alive by January 1st 2010 (the recent Their remaining life expectancies were im- using www.mortality.org holding cohort mortal- data for the Danish population (based on data from Statistics Denmark).

quencies (CCA) and genotype frequencies (CCG), – as well as case control comparisons of haplotype frequencies (CCH) were performed for the Danish cohorts using the Plink statistical software (http:// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink; Purcell et al. 2007). CCH was analyzed by regression analysis adjusting for sex. Haplotypes were defined by a sliding window of three SNPs (only considering haplotypes with frequency >5%). In sex-stratified – CCG analysis, first an additive model (Cochran Armitage test) and secondly recessive and dominant models were applied. To adjust CCG for sex, when analyzing both genders combined, CCG was ana- lyzed using a generalized linear model in the R software (http://www.r-project.org). Again additive, recessive, and dominant models were applied. The German replication data were analyzed in the same way for CCAs and CCGs. Finally, gene-based analysis was conducted in Plink by set-based analyses for each gene, calculating a mean of the single-SNP P values taking into account linkage disequilibrium (LD) be- tween the SNPs. The P-set value was corrected for multiple testing for the number of SNPs in each gene

In the replication study, survival analysis using genotype data from the Leiden 85-plus Study was performed in Stata 11.1 by applying a sex-adjusted – Cox proportional hazard model. Kaplan Meier plots for the Dutch and the Danish cohorts were generated in Stata 11.1.

For all analyses, a nominal significance level was set to 0.05. Correction for multiple testing was performed by the permutation approach (applying max(T) permu- tation mode set at 10,000 permutations) for analyses carried out in the Plink and R software.

LD estimates for the APOE SNPs were obtained using the Plink software, and the LD data were used in the HaploView software (http://www.broadinstitute. org/haploview/haploview; Barrett et al. 2005) for gen- eration of an APOE LD plot.

Data on IL6 expression measurements was ana- lyzed in the STATA 11.1 statistical program by Δ linear regression of C and rs2069827 genotype t data, adjusting for age at blood sampling (the latter was initially observed to be a confounder). Assumptions of normal distribution and equal var- Δ – iance were tested for Ct by Shapiro Wilk and – – Breusch Pagan/Cook Weisberg tests. A box plot Δ of mean Ct by rs2069827 genotype groups was generated in STATA 11.1.

Two survival variables were applied in the Danish longitudinal study. First, we wanted to explore the genetic contribution to surviving for a short period versus a longer period of time during the ninth decade of life. The distribution of survival times was right skewed (data not shown); hence, a cutoff with respect

Results

(Candore et al. 2006; Franceschi et al. 2000; Li et al. 2009b; Soerensen et al. 2010), the analyses were re- peated while stratifying by gender. The sex-specific analyses of rs9923854 (CETP) and rs769449 (APOE) were in complete agreement with the result of the combined group, although rs769449 (APOE) did not pass correction for multiple testing (see Supplementary Table 3, Online Resource 4).

The 102 genotyped SNPs in the 16 candidate genes are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (Online Resource 2), whereas the Danish discovery cohorts and German and Dutch replication populations are described in Table 1.

Gene-based analysis confirmed the association of variations in CETP and APOE with longevity (see Table 3). HSPA14 and SIRT6 also showed significance in the gene-based analysis, but the gene-based P value for SIRT6 reflected the association of only a single SNP, since the remaining SIRT6 SNPs were insignificant at the single-marker level (data not shown).

Comparison of allele frequencies between middle- aged and oldest-old Danes showed more significant findings than expected by chance (see Supplementary Table 2, Online Resource 3) and left two out of 102 SNPs significant after correction for multiple testing. The minor allele frequency of rs9923854 (CETP) was – enriched in the 92 93 year olds, implying that this allele is advantageous for survival from middle-age to old age (OR >1). In contrast, rs769449 (APOE) displayed a decreased prevalence of the minor allele, thus indicating a disadvantageous effect on survival (OR <1). Analysis of genotype frequencies supported – these findings. Haplotype case control comparisons identified three haplotypes significantly associated with longevity after correction for multiple testing; all three included either rs9923854 (CETP) or rs769449 (APOE) and demonstrated effects in line with the single-SNP analysis. The data are summarized in Table 2.

ε 2/3/4 polymorphism (Bathum et al. 2006; Caliebe et al. 2010; Jacobsen et al. 2010) from 1,270 of the partic- ipants, we found that rs769449 (APOE) was in moderate LD with the ApoE ε 4 defining SNP rs429358 (R20 0.55). An LD plot for the APOE SNPs genotyped in this ε study and the two ApoE SNPs rs429358 and rs7412 is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 (Online Resource 5). In order to determine whether the effect of rs769449 was ε independent of APOE , logistic regression was per- – formed for case control status and rs769449 genotype data adjusting for gender and for either rs429358 or rs7412 genotype data. Using the 1,270 individuals with available information, the initially significant association 0 (P 0.043) remained unchanged after adjusting for

In the gene- based analysis, IL6 showed a P-set value of 0.0068, yet this estimate reflected only rs2069827, since the other IL6 SNP (rs12700386) was insignif- icant in the single-marker analysis (data not shown). None of the remaining 15 genes showed P-set values below 0.05 (which was based on more than one signif- icant SNP) confirming the lack of association between variations in any other genes than IL6.

Replication studies in a German case– control population and in the Danish longitudinal data

When analyzing the APOE and CETP SNPs in a German population of 1,613 oldest-old and 1,104 middle-aged individuals, rs769449 (APOE) was sup- ported at the allelic level, whereas rs9923854 (CETP) showed borderline significance at the allelic level (95% CI (OR)0 0.960– 1.358), and was supported at the genotype level (see Table 4). In order to investigate whether the two SNPs also affected survival during old age, regression analysis on survival data on the oldest-old Danes (see below) was performed. We found no effect of rs769449 (APOE), while rs9923854 (CETP) showed nominal significance in females separately, with an estimate pointing in the same direction as observed in the case– control com- parison (the data are summarized in Table 4).

From the regression analysis, the quantitative effect of carrying at least one rs2069827 A allele was esti- mated to be 0.77 and 0.74 additional years of survival for AA/AC males and females, respectively, compared to a mean survival time of 2.91 and 3.74 years for rs2069827-CC males and females, respectively, hence indicating a considerable effect.

base on SNP function prediction locates rs2069827 to ′ a putative transcription factor binding site in the 5 untranslated region of IL6. Hence, the level of IL6 mRNAwas analyzed by qPCR using 198 representative samples from the middle-aged cohort, for which RNA was available. No significant difference in mRNA levels was observed between genotype groups for rs2069827 0 Δ (P value 0.532). The average C values in each t rs2069827 group are depicted in Fig. 2, clearly illustrat- ing no difference between heterozygotes and common homozygotes.

Discussion

Several candidate genes have been explored for their part in human longevity. The majority of the previous studies on the genes investigated here have focused on one or a few variations and have often been followed by contradictory replication results. Interestingly, in this study we did include three of the specific SNPs reported previously (rs4343 (ACE), rs5882 (CETP), and rs1801133 (MTHFR)). Retrospectively inspecting these SNPs in the data shows that only rs4343 (ACE) was nominally significantly associated with longevity (P<0.05) in concordance with the initial publications, while no effect of the other two SNPs could be noted. Thus, these results emphasize that such a single-marker candidate approach might point to a specific polymor- phism, yet it does not enable conclusions on the possible relevance of variation in the gene region as such.

To facilitate the confirmation of the relevance of a number of well-known candidate genes for longevity, we thus extended the examination of these genes to cover the majority of the common variation in the regions by using a total of 102 tagging SNPs. Apply- – ing the case control approach, two SNPs, rs769449 (APOE) and rs9923854 (CETP), were found to be associated with longevity. The effect of these was supported by haplotype and gene-based analyses and

al. 2010). Moreover, in the cohort individuals used in the present paper for investigating the dependency between ε APOE and rs769449, rs429358 alone also shows a modest effect on survival during old age (unpublished data). Yet, such an effect was not seen for rs769449, indicating that rs769449 does not reflect all the effects of rs429358. In contrast, rs9923854 (CETP) did show nominal effects on survival during old age, yet only in females, indicating that the effect of this SNP might become gender specific toward the most late part of life.

Apoe is involved in lipoprotein metabolism via its binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on the surface of for instance liver cells, hereby mediating endocytosis and consequently removal of LDL from the circulation. The isoforms of APOE (E2, E3, and E4) have been shown to interact differently with diverse LDL receptors, leading to differences in LDL levels, APOE4 being associated with the highest LDL levels. Moreover, APOE4 possibly also influences oxidative stress and inflammatory states. These mechanisms are probably the basis of the increased risk of premature ’ atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, Alzheimer s dis- ε ease, and mortality repeatedly found in APOE 4 car- riers (Chung et al. 2010; Dietrich et al. 2005; Jofre- Monseny et al. 2007; Vitek et al. 2009). The association of rs769449 (APOE) to longevity identified here is probably a proxy for these functional effects.

was supported in the German replication population, hence pointing to importance of genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism for longevity.

Cetp has opposing effects on lipoprotein metabo- lism. On one hand, it increases LDL and very-low- density lipoproteins (VLDLs) levels by transferring cholesterol esters from high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) to LDLs/VLDLs. On the other hand, it increases removal of lipoproteins from the circulation as part of transferring triglycerides from VLDLs/LDLs to HDLs (reviewed in Weber et al. 2010). Hence, one might expect the rare allele of rs9923854 (CETP) to contribute to decreased cholesterol ester transfer activity and/or increased triglyceride transfer activity, although the role could well be much more complex. This is underlined by the difference in success observed in clinical studies of cetp inhibitors for prevention of atherosclerosis (Weber et al. 2010).

The effect of APOE rs769449 did, however, most ε likely reflect the well-known effect of the APOE 4 haplotype defining rs429358 and was not evident in ε advanced age survival. The APOE 4 haplotype has in our cohorts not only been reported to pose a negative effect on survival from middle age to old age (Gerdes et al. 2000; Tan et al. 2004) but also on survival during old age (Bathum et al. 2006; Deelen et al. 2011; Jacobsen et

CC (N=45) AC (N= 153)182069827 (IL6) genotype groups 

the level of the entire gene indicated a positive effect of the rare variants of HSPA14 on survival from middle-aged to old-aged. HSPA14 belongs to the same functional group as HSPA1A and HSPA1L (70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70s)) previously reported as associated with human longevity (Altomare et al.

2003; Ross et al. 2003; Singh et al. 2010). Hsp14 (also named hsp70L1) is a rather recently identified hsp70 protein (Wan et al. 2004) and is known to be located in ribosomes, probably playing a role in the folding of newly translated proteins (Otto et al. 2005). Accord- ingly, the rare alleles of the HSPA14 SNPs reported here could be hypothesized to enhance such activity and, thus, avoid accumulation of newly translated proteins during aging. However, hsp14 also enhances cellular immunity in dendrites, e.g., stimulating secre- α tion of for instance IL12 and TNF , and has therefore been suggested as an adjuvant for the treatment of cancer and infectious disease (Wu et al. 2005). An enhancement of such effects could intuitively be con- sidered to pose a positive effect on longevity, although the connection between immune regulatory processes and longevity is, as explained below, probably not that straightforward.

When investigating survival during old age in the longitudinal study, we found rs2069827 (IL6) as the only SNP posing an effect, an effect which was con- firmed in the Dutch replication cohort. The relation of immune regulatory genes to longevity is in general based on the idea of a balance between pro- and anti- inflammatory processes, since aging is accompanied by both a decline in several immune functions (immu- nosenescence) and an increase in a chronic low-grade inflammation state (inflammaging). The genetic poly- morphisms associated with longevity are presumed to increase the ability to cope with inflammaging (Jyl- hava and Hurme 2010). Therefore, one might expect the rare allele of rs2069827 (IL6) to hold a low pro- inflammatory activity. Such low activity could pre- sumably be caused by low IL6 expression, yet in our qPCR study we observed no difference in IL6 mRNA levels between rs2069827 genotype groups. Hence, the impact of this SNP does not appear to be mediated through changes in IL6 expression. Finally, rs2069827 may simply be a proxy for a causal variant not geno- typed in the present study.

In conclusion, we here add data to the proposed roles of 16 frequently discussed candidate genes, in- dicating that variation in APOE and CETP, and possi- ble HSPA14, is of importance in survival from middle age to old age, whereas genetic variation in IL6 seems to affect survival during late life.
