Abstract

Successful aging (SA) is a multidimensional phenotype involving living to an older age with high physical function, preserved cognition, and continued social engagement. Several domains underlying SA are heritable, and identifying health-promoting polymorphisms and their interactions with the environment could provide important information regarding the health of older adults. In the present study, we examined 263 cognitively intact Amish individuals age 80 and older (74 SA and 189 normally aged) all of whom are part of a single 13-generation pedigree. A genome-wide association study of 630,309 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed and analyzed for linkage using multipoint analyses and for association using the modified quasi-likelihood score test. There was evidence for linkage on 6q25-27 near the fragile site FRA6E region with a dominant model maximum multipoint heterogeneity LOD score 3.2. The 1-LOD-down support interval for this linkage contained one SNP for which there was regionally significant evidence of association (rs205990, p < 2.36105). This marker survived interval-wide Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and was located between the genes QKI and PDE10A. Other areas of chromosome 6q25-q27 (including the FRA6E region) contained several SNPs associated with SA (minimum p 2.89 Ã— 10-6). These findings suggest potentially novel genes in the 6q25-q27 region linked and associated with SA in the Amish; however, these findings should be verified in an independent replication cohort.

Previous genetic studies of SA have focused on three primary categories of genes selected primarily for their relevance to aging-associated pathophysiological processes or processes that are known to change during the aging process (Glatt et al. 2007). These categories include: (1) genes involved in the maintenance of cholesterol, lipid, and/or lipoproteins (Arking et al. 2005; Cellini et al. 2005; Taioli et al. 2001); (2) genes that influence inflammation and immune response, particularly cytokines, many of which also influence cell cycling, growing, motility, and signaling (Capurso et al. 2004; Naumova et al. 2004); and (3) genes involved in drug metabolism (Taioli et al. 2001). To date, few of the candidate genes associated with SA have been successfully replicated, with the exception of a few studies that have associated with longevity but not SA (Atzmon et al. 2009a; Banasik et al. 2011; Chung et al. 2010; Deelen et al. 2011; Kleindorp et al. 2011; Li et al. 2009; Nebel et al. 2011; Snejdrlova et al. 2011), suggesting that this approach may not be the best for a complex trait such as SA.

Introduction

With the rapid expansion of the population over age 60, understanding the components of successful aging (SA) is becoming a critical component of the medical and public health response to this demographic shift. The number of adults over age 60 is predicted to reach two billion worldwide by the year 2050, more than doubling from 2000 (US Census Bureau Population Division and Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division 2001). This growing elderly population could dramatically impact our healthcare system depending on how successfully this population ages with regard to multiple factors such as physical, mental, and social well-being. Surprisingly, a large proportion of older adults have continued to function at a high level and have aged successfully (Depp and Jeste 2006). Understanding why some individuals avoid significant decline in physical function and susceptibility to age-related diseases might help guide clinical care and provide the basis for novel programs to prevent or slow such declines.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) avoid choosing specific candidate genesAdjusted 3MS <87, but after further neuropsychological testing and evaluation at a consensus conference (Hahs et al. 2006), individuals were determined not to be cognitively impaired. They would be classified as SA if they met other criteria. SA individuals did not have significant depressive symptoms. This study is part of the larger ongoing Collaborative Aging and Memory Project (CAMP), a multi-institutional prospective population-based study of aging and dementia in the Amish communities of Adams, Elkhart, and LaGrange counties in Indiana and Holmes County in Ohio, conducted from 2002 until the present. These communities were formed in several waves of migration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (van der Walt et al. 2005). The Amish originally emigrated from Europe to Pennsylvania in the 1700s, and a further westward expansion of the Amish population occurred in the early 1800s when a subset of the Pennsylvania population migrated to Ohio and Indiana. A second wave of migration from Switzerland arrived in the nineteenth century, eventually settling in Adams County, Indiana, in the 1850s. Present-day Amish in Holmes County, Ohio, and Elkhart and LaGrange counties, Indiana are largely descended from the first wave of westward immigration from Pennsylvania, while the Adams County, Indiana settlements are largely descended from the second wave of immigration that passed through Pennsylvania (van der Walt et al. 2005). Both sets of communities have a degree of shared history and ancestry with the Pennsylvania Amish communities.

Written and informed consent was obtained for all participants and their legal guardians.

For the SA arm of the CAMP study, individuals over age 80 were identified through public directories published by individual Amish communities and referral from individuals already enrolled in the study. Once individuals were identified, a door-to-door interview was performed for a baseline examination. Self-rated physical function was assessed by several well-established instruments. Basic self-care was assessed using a modified Katz ADL scale consisting of eight items: bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, continence, transferring, walking, and eating (Katz 1983). Difficulty with musculoskeletal function was assessed by a five-item scale based on the work of Nagi (1976) used in the EPESE (Seeman et al. 1994): pushing large objects, stooping or kneeling, carrying weights over 10 lb, extending arms above shoulder level, and writing. Advanced daily living tasks were evaluated by a three-item modified Rosow Breslau scale (Rosow and Breslau 1966) assessing difficulty performing heavy work around the house or farm, walking up and down a flight of stairs, and walking a half mile without help. A final scale assessing more integrative functions IADLs consisted of six of the eight items suggested by Lawton and Brody (1969): traveling, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework, managing medications, and handling money.

Next, we considered whether individuals met standard cutoffs for high function on the self-reported measures of physical function: total scores of 0 or 1 on the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental (IADL) scales, indicating no assistance or partial assistance on only a single item needed; Nagi score of 0 or 1 (Nagi 1976), indicating no difficulty or difficulty on only one item; Rosow Breslau score of 3 or 4, indicating limitation on zero items or one item. Lower extremity function was considered by limiting SA to individuals scoring in the top 1/3 of the sample on the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) short physical performance battery summary score (>8 on a 12 point scale). Finally, individuals considered SA self-reported to be satisfied or very satisfied with life.

There were a total of 263 Amish individuals included in this study after performing sample quality control (QC). Among these 263 individuals, 74 were classified as SA and 189 were classified as controls. This study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Miami and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

In addition to these self-reported measures of functioning, a short physical performance test developed for use in the EPESE was used to assess lower extremity function (SeLOD scores were calculated using the Lander Green algorithm implemented in Merlin (Abecasis et al. 2002). PLINK was utilized to select a set of 4,941 markers with low linkage disequilibrium (pairwise r2<0.16 for all markers) for multipoint linkage analysis. Inter-marker map distances were obtained from the Rutgers Combined Physical Linkage Map (Matise et al. 2007). Multipoint LOD scores allowing for heterogeneity (multipoint heterogeneity LOD score (MHLOD)) were calculated using affected-only dominant (trait 0 allele frequency 0.001), affected-only recessive (trait 0 allele frequency 0.20), and nonparametric allele-sharing (multipoint nonparametric allele-sharing LOD score (MLOD*)) models.

Quality control was performed using the APT software release 1.12.0 available from Affymetrix, Inc Santa Clara, CA to conduct additional sample QC. Twenty-nine samples were dropped due to low contrast QC, and all individuals with inconsistent genders were dropped if the inconsistency could not be resolved, removing 20 samples. RELPAIR software (Epstein et al. 2000) was used to test for misspecification of pedigree relationships and obtain a list of problematic individuals to be followed up and resolved; all misspecifications were resolved, and seven samples were dropped due to sample genotyping efficiency (<95 %).

The case control analysis of SA was performed using the modified quasi-likelihood score (MQLS) method, a quasi-likelihood score test that accounts for correlations among individuals to maintain correct type I error rates and tests for allelic association (Thornton and McPeek 2007). MQLS uses a kinship variance/covariance matrix of inbreeding coefficients and kinship coefficients to account for inbreeding and relatedness between individuals using a specified pedigree structure. Population prevalence for SA of 30 % was specified, consistent with the frequency of SA in the current study. The method is computationally tractable for GWAS. Only analyses of autosomal SNPs were performed.

PLINK (Purcell et al. 2007) statistical software was used both for marker QC and to format data for analysis. Markers included in analyses had a minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05 and a genotyping efficiency >95 %, resulting in the removal of 221,982 markers for MAF and 30,303 markers for genotyping efficiency. Markers that did not map to a chromosome, mitochondrial SNPs, and X chromosome SNPs were also excluded (23,997). A goodness of fit test was used to examine deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the most unrelated individuals (166 individuals determined by pairwise kinship coefficients obtained from the KinInbcoef program (Thornton and McPeek 2007)). Markers with strong deviations from HWE (p<1.0107) were removed from the analysis, removing seven markers. Genotypes on 551 individuals generated by the CAMP dementia study were also available.

The results of multipoint genome-wide linkage analysis for all chromosomes using parametric affected-only dominant, parametric affected-only recessive, and nonparametric linkage models are summarized in Fig. 1. Five regions of the genome generated multipoint LOD scores (MHLOD or MLOD*) exceeding three under at least one of the models tested. The peak MHLOD of 3.24 on chromosome 6 occurred under a dominant model at 166.19 Mb, with a 1-LOD-down support interval extending from 164.38 to 169.62 Mb. The peak MHLOD of 3.30 on chromosome 16 was obtained at 23.97 Mb under a recessive model (1-LOD-down support interval, 18.97 to 26.57 Mb). Three peaks were detected under the nonparametric model on chromosomes 10 (peak MLOD* 4.30 at 4.26 Mb, 1-LOD-down support interval 3.28 to 5.59 Mb), 17 (peak MLOD* 3.50 at 10.09 Mb, 1-LOD-down support interval 9.82 to 11.49 Mb), and 20 (peak MLOD* 3.3 at 0.93 Mb, 1-LOD-down support interval 0.58 to 4.07 Mb).

A description of the criteria used to define SA and normally aged control individuals is provided in Table 1, and a description of the study sample is provided in Table 2. SA cases were slightly younger and had a higher proportion of males than the controls. A larger proportion of SA cases were from Ohio than Indiana, although a majority of participants were from Indiana. SA cases had slightly lower butmarried). No specific gene has previously been associated with risk for SA or any other longevity or aging trait. PDE10A is involved in neurological cascades and has been linked to schizophrenia and Huntington's disease (Arnaud et al. 2008; Kehler et al. 2011; Kleiman et al. 2011). Three SNPs in the FRA6E region were located in the Parkinson juvenile disease protein 2 (PARK2) gene and were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (Online Resource Fig. 3) with each other, with r2 ranging from 0.86 to Table 3 shows the strongest MQLS results from binary trait analyses. The SNPs with the strongest evidence for association (p<1.00105) were not located in genes and did not show evidence for linkage. Several of these markers are on chromosome 6 within the FRA6E region, which is less than 3 Mb from the top linkage result.

Although we observed strong evidence for linkage at three additional regions on chromosomes 10, 17, and 20, markers under these linkage peaks did not show individual evidence for association. This may be due to either a lack of power to find association or possibly due to segregation of alleles in sub-pedigrees and not population-level association.

A previously published genome-wide scan associating thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid levels with gene variants observed a strong association with PDE8A and PDE10A in age-diverse populations (Sardinians, Tuscans, and Old Order Amish) (Arnaud-Lopez et al. 2008). The strongest association in this previously published study was in PDE8A; however, PDE10A is in the same enzyme family and is involved in the cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP signaling pathways. The PDE10A gene protein product has been found to be involved in the pathophysiology of human disease. TSH controls thyroid function through binding of G protein-coupled receptor, TSH receptor (TSHR), and cAMP production. TSH plays a role in muscle, bone, central nervous system, and heart physiology, and therefore may contribute to several complex disorders. In addition, the TSHR expression has previously been associated with exceptional longevity in a previously published study of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, which may support a role for PDE10A in SA (Atzmon et al. 2009b).

The nearest neighboring genes to these markers in the FRA6E region were PLG and MAP3K4. PLG is a circulating zymogen with the primary function of dissolving fibrin (OMIM #173350). PLG is not an established candidate gene for SA but has been suggested to be involved with wasting (weight loss and poor wound healing) and decreased longevity due to disseminated fibrin deposition in animal model studies (Cheng et al. 2005). There is no established biological evidence implicating MAP3K4 with longevity or aging.

A potential limitation to our study was the inability of MQLS to allow for covariate adjustment, and as a result we were unable to adjust for heterogeneity in study findings across ascertainment centers (Ohio and Indiana). However, our linkage analyses should implicitly take care of confounding through pedigree structure. Since we looked at a consensus of results across linkage and association analyses, we believe that the results are not likely confounded by ascertainment center and merit further follow-up.

We observed a higher rate of SA in males relative to females in our cohort, results that have not been consistently observed in previous literature. Studies in the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging observed that males were more likely to have better physical performance at baseline in a cohort of 70-79-year-olds with high function, consistent with our observations (Seeman et al. 1994). The studies by McLaughlin et al. of adults aged 65 and older, however, observed the opposite association between SA and gender (McLaughlin et al. 2010). A possible explanation for these differences is the definition of SA used. We attempted to use a definition as comprehensive as possible, integrating factors pertaining to physical and cognitive function, social engagement, and health, whereas other studies often used only one or two of these components. Another possible explanation for the larger number of SA males relative to females could be the effect of marital status on successful aging which has previously been indicated (Li et al. 2006). Our sample also had a greater proportion of successfully aged men (52% of men SA vs. 17% of women SA) who were currently married (78% of men currently married vs. 45% of women currently married).(2019) The relationship between gender, marriage, and SA has not been consistent across studies, with the majority finding no association; however, it merits further study.
