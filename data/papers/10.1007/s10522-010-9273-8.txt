Abstract Longevity is a complex phenomenon involving multiple environmental and biological factors. Genetic studies of longevity have focussed on DNA repair, oxidative damage correction and immune-related genes. Vitamin-D works by modu- lating mineral homeostasis and key physiological processes such as cell proliferation and immune response. Vitamin-D insufficiency has been largely considered a risk factor for life-limiting illnesses including cardiovascular and immune-related dis- eases and cancer. Vitamin-D acts through vitamin-D- receptor (VDR), which regulates the expression of vitamin-D-response genes. VDR variants have been associated with susceptibility to cancer, bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and allergies. In the present study we evaluated VDR as candidate gene involved in human longevity. We selected five polymorphisms of the VDR gene that capture vari- ability at the 50, coding and 30 regions. Genotype data was obtained from 104 octogenarians ([85 years) and 114 controls (17–40 years). Although differences

Introduction

Longevity is a complex phenomenon in which environmental, social, stochastic and biological fac- tors are involved. Maximum lifespan potential of individuals has a strong biological component; pop- ulation life expectancy is a multifactorial trait based on both biological and non-biological factors. In humans, as in other species, long-lived individuals emerge as a result of a successful life, lack of stochastic damaging factors and healthy aging. Recent socioeconomic improvements and advances in prevention and treatment of diseases have reduced infant mortality as well as allowing individuals to survive to extreme old age. As a result, life expec- tancy in humans has increased in developed coun- tries, with no effect on maximum lifespan potential. Social and technological improvements have been crucial to increased human longevity, creating a new scenario in which longevity-related biological factors

Several VDR polymorphisms with functional have been described in the promoter, coding 30 untranslated region (UTR) (Uitterlinden et al. Two common polymorphisms, Cdx (rs1568820) A1012G (rs4516035), have been located in the regulatory region that affect binding to transcription The rs1568820 polymorphism is a G to A between exons 1f and 1e that alters the site for the intestinal-specific transcription ‘‘caudal-related homeodomain protein-2’’ (Cdx- affecting vitamin-D-VDR-mediated intestinal cal- absorption (Arai et al. 2001). The rs4516035 is an A to G transition located between and 1a exons that modifies the GATA-3 transcrip- factor recognition sequence, involved in the of Th2 polarization (Halsall et al. 2004). addition, a common FokI (rs10735810) polymor- has been described in the VDR coding region alters the first ATG start site to an alternate ACG giving rise to a VDR protein that is three acids shorter (424 aas versus 427 aas) (Gross al. 1996). Functional differences among rs10735810 shows that VDR protein coded by the allele (short 424 aas) interacted more effi- with TFIIB and showed greater transcriptional than the full-length VDR protein coded by allele (Jurutka et al. 2000). Finally, a common fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), as BsmI (rs1544410), and a microsatellite designated as PolyA (rs17878969), has described in the 30-UTR region (Morrison et al. Ingles et al. 1997). Functional effects of 30-UTR have been related to alterations in VDR mRNA (Fang et al. 2005).

have been able to operate. The aging process has been considered the result of the accumulation of damages in cells and tissues that, left uncorrected, produces a systemic dysfunction concluding in death. Through- out the lifespan, however, cell maintenance mecha- nisms, such as DNA-repairing enzymes, correction of oxidative damage and immune system response against pathogens and tumour cells, attempt to correct the damage.

status, vitamin-D has been largely considered pro- tective and a promoter of good health (Holick and Chen 2008). Pleiotropic effects of vitamin-D have been largely known to affect mineral metabolism, cell proliferation and immune response modulation. Vita- min-D status has been described as involved in life- limiting diseases (Heaney 2008) such as cancer (Garland et al. 2009), cardiovascular diseases (Gouni-Berthold et al. 2009), osteoporosis (Lash et al. 2009), sarcopenia (Roth et al. 2004; Visser et al. 2003) and diabetes (Danescu et al. 2009). In addition, vitamin-D has an important role in the modulation of the immune response, inducing micro- bicide factors against bacterial infections (Wang et al. 2004) and controlling the exacerbation of the cellular immune response (Deluca and Cantorna 2001). Based on this, it has been proposed a major positive role for vitamin-D in biogerontology by reducing suscepti- bility in the elderly to chronic degenerative diseases (Hayes 2010).

Sources of vitamin-D come from dietary intake, mainly oily fish such as salmon, mackerel and sardines (Chen et al. 2007) and egg yolks (Lamberg- Allardt 2006), and from endogenous synthesis by photolytic reaction of vitamin-D precursors in the skin (Lips 2006). Both types of sources are strongly linked to environment, such as climate and latitude, and social behaviour, such as daily diet, sun exposure and clothing. In addition, demographic factors must be considered, such as culture habits, gender and age, which act in several ways to change social behaviour as well as race, which is related to melanin pigmen- tation (Chen et al. 2007). Genes coding for vitamin-D metabolic enzymes and downstream mediators of vitamin-D signalling constitute a complex gene network. Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) plays a pivotal role in this network, acting as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that modulates the expression of vitamin-D responsive genes (Pike 1991).

tant for designing association studies of complex phenotypes, as revealed by recent research on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern of the human genome. LD refers to the non-random transmission of alleles of neighbouring loci that is high for closer loci and decreases with distance. In addition, recombina- tion rate is a determinant factor for decreasing LD. The underlying structure of LD in the human genome reveals a series of discrete blocks of high LD interrupted by hotspot recombination sites. LD blocks range from 5 to 50 kb and are characterized by a reduced diversity of allelic combinations (haplotypes) (Wall and Pritchard 2003). Studies of the VDR genomic region in Caucasians have revealed a

scattered LD pattern with rs1568820 and rs4516035 polymorphisms included in a single block of the VDR promoter and rs1544410 and rs17878969 polymor- phisms included in a 30UTR block. Blocks are separated by a hotspot recombination region that includes the rs10735810 polymorphism (Fang et al.

Madison, USA). VDR genotyping followed protocols described by de la Torre et al. (2008). For each subject we obtained genotype information from five polymorphic variants located in the VDR gene at: 50 promoter region, rs11568820 and rs4516035; coding region, rs10735810 and 30UTR, rs1544410 and rs17878969 (Fig. 1a). All markers were coded as biallelic, including the rs17878969 microsallite poly- morphism that shows a biphasic distribution of short (\18 adenosine repeats, S) and long (C18 adenosine repeats, L) allele populations (Ingles et al. 1997).

Several studies reveal that polymorphisms at VDR locus are associated with life-limiting diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and immune sys- tem disturbances (Uitterlinden et al. 2004b). There- fore, we propose VDR as a candidate gene involved in human longevity as a result of its protection from age-related diseases and modulation of the immune response. Taking advantage of the known haplotype block structure of the VDR genomic region, we performed an association study for longevity consid- ering both single genotypes and haplotypes.

Statistical analysis

We compared genotype and allele distribution between controls and octogenarians by contingency table analysis performed by the OpenEpi web resource (Sullivan et al. 2009). Fisher exact test P values were considered in each comparison. Correction for multi- ple testing was done applying the SNP spectral decomposition approach, which takes into account the linkage disequilibrium between markers (Nyholt 2004). The significance threshold required to maintain a Type I error rate of 5% was P = 0.036 for two- marker haplotypes and P = 0.011 for five-marker haplotypes. Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium was measured by the normalized D0 coefficient (Lewontin 1988) that was estimated using Haploview 4.2 software (Barrett et al. 2005). Absolute D0 values range from 0 (no disequilibrium), indicating that alleles are randomly distributed and all expected haplotypes are observed, to 1 (complete disequilib- rium), indicating a non random distribution of alleles with a less observed haplotypes than expected.

Materials and methods

Subjects

In total, 214 Caucasian subjects from the city of Lleida in northeast Spain were included between January and June 2004: 104 octogenarians ([85 years), 72 women (mean age 89.4 ± 3.6; range 85–100) and 32 men (mean age 89.4 ± 3.2; range 85– 97), and 110 sex-matched healthy young individuals, 75 women (mean age 28 ± 5.8; range 17–39) and 35 men (mean age 29 ± 8.6; range 17–40), were selected as cases and controls, respectively. A comprehensive medical history was obtained from each octogenarian, focussing on the absence of vitamin-D related illness such as osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, immuno- deficiency and cancer. Written informed consent for enrolment in the study and for personal data manage- ment was obtained from all subjects in accordance with Spanish laws. The Ethics Committee for our institution approved the study.

We used PHASE 2.1.1 software (Stephens et al. 2001) to perform statistical inference of haplotypes from our sample data. Only data from fully geno- typed subjects, 86 octogenarians (25 males) and 101 controls (35 males), were considered. We used the ‘‘out_pair’’ PHASE output file to assign haplotypes for each individual, with their corresponding proba- bility. Haplotype counts were estimated by obtaining the cumulative probability of each haplotype. In brief, for an individual bearing haplotype A with probability 0.3 and haplotype B with probability 0.7, 0.3 and 0.7 were added to the corresponding counts of haplotypes A and B, respectively. Following the same rationale, we estimated the presence of 0, 1 or 2 copies of a specific haplotype in each individual.

DNA sources and genotyping

Genomic DNA from controls was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using a KG-Midi extraction kit (Camgen, Cambridge, UK). DNA from octogenarians was obtained from buccal swabs using the BuccalAmp DNA extraction kit (Epicentre,

D0 values were calculated and plotted by Haploview 4.2 software (http:// www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview). Numbers inside boxes correspond to D0 9100. Block structure was considered for marker pairs showing D0 [0.8, following the ‘‘solid-spine’’ block definition implemented in Haploview. In controls, two blocks were identified, block-1 at the 50 regulatory region including markers rs4516035–rs11568820 and block-2 at the 30UTR region including markers rs17878969–rs1544410. No block pattern was observed in octogenarians

Comparison of global haplotype distribution between controls and octogenarians was done by the ‘‘product of approximate conditionals’’ (PAC)-likelihood test implemented in PHASE 2.1.1 (Li and Stephens 2003). Differences between groups for specific hap- lotypes were evaluated by 2 9 2 contingency table analysis performed by the OpenEpi web resource.

The distribution of carriers of at least one copy of GGCGS haplotype (0.5% in controls and 8.3% in octogenarians, P = 0.023) is presented in Table 2. Males carrying at least one copy of GGCGS haplotype represent just 0.1% in controls but 18.9% in octoge- narians (P = 0.012).

(PHASE PAC-likelihood test P = 0.01) (Fig. 2b). Haplotype-specific test revealed that rs1544410- G:rs17878969-S (GS) haplotype was overrepresented in octogenarians (7.3 versus 0.8%; odds ratio (OR): 15.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3–637; P \ 0.001) (Fig. 2a). This difference was greater in males (14.2% in octogenarians versus 0.3% in controls, OR out of range, P = 0.006) (Fig. 2b). We also estimated the haplotype carrier status of each individual. The distribution of carriers of at least one copy of 30UTR GS haplotype is presented in Table 2. Carriers of at least one copy of GS haplotype were common in octogenarians (13.3%) but rare in controls (1.6%) (P = 0.008). Among males, nearly a quarter of the octogenarians carried at least one copy of GS haplotype, whereas GS carriers represent less than 1% of controls (24.4 versus 0.7%, respec- tively; P = 0.013).

Discussion

Long-lived people escaped or delayed major age- related illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer, as well as life-threatening infections and immune-related diseases. It is noteworthy that vita- min-D plays a key role in these impairing diseases (Holick 2005). A general concern exists about the vitamin-D insufficiency that has been found in older persons (Holick 2006). Recent data indicates that low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D are associated with all-cause mortality in the general population (Dobnig et al. 2008) as well as in older men and women (Pilz et al. 2009). However, the question of whether vitamin-D deficiency is a cause or a conse- quence of poor health status remains to be answered.

Extended five-marker haplotypes were also esti- mated. Prevalence in controls and octogenarians is presented in Fig. 3. Extended five-marker haplotype counts and frequencies were compared between groups. Global five-marker haplotype distribution showed statistically significant differences (PHASE PAC-likelihood test P = 0.020) (Fig. 3a), again mainly contributed by differences in males (PHASE PAC-likelihood test P = 0.020) (Fig. 3b).

in the aging process (Lanske and Razzaque 2007; Tuohimaa 2009). Studies in animal models have revealed a paradoxical effect of vitamin-D on aging. Genetically modified mice lacking FGF23 and Klotho genes exhibit features of premature aging that have been related with an altered mineral homeostasis and

Again, these differences

hormonal forms of vitamin-D where both hyper- and hypovitaminosis are risk factors for abnormal aging (Tuohimaa 2009). This bimodal effect of vitamin-D levels also has been described for vascular disease risk in children on dialysis (Shroff et al. 2008) and prostate cancer risk in Nordic countries (Tuohimaa et al. 2004). Therefore, it can be assumed that for good

hypervitaminosis-D due to increased 1-a-hydroxilase activity (Razzaque and Lanske 2006). At the same time, null mice for the vitamin-D receptor gene, in which vitamin-D action cannot occur, also show features related with premature aging (Keisala et al. 2009). According to this, it has been proposed that aging shows a hormetic U-shaped dependency on

the common 30UTR haplotypes GL and AS been linked to low and high mRNA stability, (Fang et al. 2005). However, no causa- effect has been assigned to rs1544410 or polymorphisms. The main resulting is to consider those polymorphisms as for an unknown causative element located in 30UTR region. In octogenarians, we found an of the GS haplotype prevalence. GS haplo- combines elements of the two common GL and haplotypes, from which we can expect an phenotype. Assuming the vitamin-D on the aging process follows a hormetic model (Tuohimaa 2009), haplotypes con- low (GL) and high (AS) VDR mRNA stability to an adverse vitamin-D response caused deficiency and toxicity, respectively. However, conferring a middle VDR mRNA stability GS) can be considered as protective, as vitamin- response can remain in the homeostatic region,

is responsible for its genomic action. Several VDR gene polymorphic variants have been described as affecting VDR gene expression (rs11568820 and rs4516035), protein structure (rs10735810) and mRNA stability (rs1544410 and rs17878969) (Fang et al. 2005; Uitterlinden et al. 2004a). Variability at the VDR locus has been associated with cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (Uitterlinden et al. 2004b) as well as mycobacterium (Bellamy and Hill 1998) and viral infections (Fibla and Caruz 2010).

and aging has been well studied, the effect of VDR variability has been evaluated only in relation to diseases; no data exist about its role in aging and longevity. In the present case–control study, we compared allele, genotype and haplotype distribution of five VDR gene variants between healthy-living octogenarians and younger controls to assess VDR as a candidate gene affecting aging and longevity. Our study is the first to provide evidence of an association between VDR gene polymorphisms and longevity, as reflected by the differential distribution of VDR haplotypes that we observed. The positive significant association between longevity and the 30UTR GS and five-marker GGCGS haplotypes was observed in octogenarian males but not in women. Epidemiolog- ical data on long-lived subjects document a clear-cut prevalence of females compared to males, suggesting that sex-specific mortality rates follow different trajectories. Demographic and behavioural risk fac- tors have been considered in the literature, but do not account for the overall sex-related difference in mortality rates (Wingard 1984). In addition, the role of biological factors has been explored with conten- tious results (Austad 2006). Our finding of a sex- specific association was in accordance with previous reports that certain polymorphisms of the interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and interferon-gamma genes are male- specific markers for longevity (Bonafe et al. 2001; Di Bona et al. 2009; Giacconi et al. 2004; Lio et al. 2002a, b), supporting a finding that female longevity is less dependent on genetic background than male longevity (Franceschi et al. 2000).

to evaluate differences in VDR variants between young and elderly subjects. The literature contains indirect data on genotype frequencies of VDR mark- ers, but comparison with our data is inappropriate due to differences in the origin of each population and in selection criteria. We acknowledge that our study has a number of potential limitations. Although octogen- arian Caucasian cohorts may have common charac- teristics, such as the limited medical care available until the 1950s, we cannot exclude potential con- founding factors. In particular, two historical events must be taken into account: the Spanish flu epidemic at the beginning of the twentieth century, which depleted the childhood population, and the Civil War (1936–1939) that had an especially important impact on male mortality (Gonza´lez et al. 1996). The first event could have produced biological consequences, while the second had a stochastic effect. Another concern refers to the comparison of different birth cohorts, within which we assumed that initial frequencies are similar (Capri et al. 2008). We cannot exclude this confounding factor in our study. However, our cohorts fit Hardy–Weinberg equilib- rium in all loci analyzed, and neither disturbances on random matting nor selective factors attributable

With respect to the biogerontological significance of the observed association, we can only suggest a

In conclusion, the well-documented impact of vitamin-D levels on the aging process and on age- related diseases is bolstered by our results. In addition, the study results propose a new scenario in which the variability of the VDR gene is also relevant and emphasize the role of VDR genetic background in determining optimal vitamin-D levels for healthy aging.
