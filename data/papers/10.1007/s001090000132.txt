Abstract Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) en- coded by the PARP-1 gene, is a ubiquitous and abundant DNA-binding protein involved in the cellular response to various genotoxic agents. In a previous study we showed that maximal oligonucleotide-stimulated poly(ADP-ribo- syl)ation was significantly higher in permeabilised lym- phoblastoid cell lines from a French population of cente- narians compared with controls aged 20–70 years, sup- porting the notion that longevity is associated with a ge- netically determined, high poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capaci- ty. Here, we describe four new genetic polymorphisms, three of which represent silent nucleotide variants (C T, 402 T C, G A), and one of which leads to a valine -to- 1011 1215 762 alanine exchange (T C). We undertook an association 2444 study between two of these polymorphisms and human longevity or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity in permea- bilised lymphoblastoid cells. By analysing 648 DNA sam- ples from a French population (324 centenarians and 324 controls) by fluorescent-allele-specific PCR, we showed the absence of any significant enrichment of any of the ge- notypes in the study of centenarians versus controls. Fur- thermore, we studied genotype distributions from individ- uals who had previously been tested for poly(ADP-ribo- syl)ation capacity. None of the genotype combinations at any polymorphic site studied could be related to a high or low level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity. Together, these results strongly suggest that the longevity-related differences in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity of hu- man lymphoblastoid cell lines cannot be explained by ge- netic polymorphisms in the PARP-1 coding sequence and that other mechanisms have to be considered as potential

Introduction

er types of DNA damage, namely poly(ADP-ribosyl)at- ion. This post-translational modification of nuclear pro- teins which facilitates the cellular recovery from DNA damage is catalysed by the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1; EC 2.4.2.30), with NAD+ serving as substrate [16, 17,18]. This enzyme is found in most eukaryotic species and accounts for about 85% of cellular poly(ADP-ribose) formation in mouse em- bryo fibroblasts [19]. Very recently, additional polypep- tides catalysing the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction have been described [20,21]; however, information re- garding the expression, structure and function of these novel PARPs is still limited. The amino-terminal do- main of PARP-1 binds to single- or double-stranded breaks in DNA. Binding to DNA breaks causes a drastic activation of the catalytic centre in the carboxy-terminal NAD+-binding domain. A number of “acceptor” pro- teins covalently modified with poly(ADP-ribose) have been identified in vivo and in vitro, including histones and PARP-1 itself. Treatment of cells with certain chemical or physical DNA-damaging agents, including γ ROS, alkylating agents, cisplatin [22], and - or ultravi- olet radiation [23], induces a dose-dependent stimula- tion of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis.

change in human life expectancy in industrialised coun- tries. Human life expectancy now exceeds 80 years, and it is likely that an increasing number of human beings will reach the maximal lifespan for humans, estimated to be about 120 years, in the 21st century [1]. However, ageing itself, which has been defined as a progressive decline in the physiological and biochemical perfor- mance of cells, tissues and organs that leads to the in- ability of the organism to maintain homeostasis at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organismic level, remains a complex and poorly understood biological process [for review see 2]. Many theories have been advanced to ac- count for the ageing process and none are generally ac- cepted [3,4]. However, the “free radical theory of age- ing”, first proposed by Harman [5], defines ageing as the result of the imperfect protection of the major cellu- lar components (lipids, proteins, DNA) against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated through aerobic metab- olism. Ever since, many data have accumulated to sup- port this theory [6,7], although other variables, such as genetic factors [8,9], are well known to have an impact on ageing too. ROS could contribute to the ageing pro- cess in a number of ways, since these highly reactive compounds can target lipids, proteins or DNA. A signif- icant body of experimental evidence demonstrates that accumulation of DNA damage as well as the induction of genomic instability are associated with ageing and age-related diseases [10, 11,12]. On the other hand, a large number of physiological protection and repair sys- tems are known to play important roles in maintaining cellular and molecular integrity, by counteracting the ac- cumulation of macromolecular damage and the atten- dant loss of macromolecular functions. For example, the potentially catastrophic accumulation of DNA damage can be antagonised by cellular DNA repair activities. DNA excision repair, a complex biochemical phenome- non directly responsible for the elimination of much DNA damage inflicted by exogenous as well as endoge- nous agents, has been implicated in longevity [13]. The “disposable soma theory” predicts that ageing is caused by an accumulation of somatic damage (arising through a variety of molecular mechanisms, such as stochastic hits endogenously produced by ROS or by environmen- tal factors; or biosynthetic errors in macromolecules) in the presence of less-than-perfect cell maintenance and repair systems whose efficiency is determined genetical- ly and is subject to evolutionary control [14]. Human beings with proven longevity (i.e. centenarians), who often maintain a remarkably good status of general physical health until very late in life and who have es-

The involvement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation specifi- cally in DNA base-excision repair has recently been doc- umented [24, 25,26]. In addition to its role in DNA re- pair, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been proposed to be in- volved in DNA replication, gene transcription, cell dif- ferentiation, integration of foreign DNA into the cell ge- nome, suppression of homologous recombination, as well as necrotic or apoptotic cell death [27].

Furthermore, Grube and Bürkle have established a positive correlation between the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 mammalian species and maximal species-specific life- span, suggesting a possible role for poly(ADP-ribosyl)at- ion as a longevity-assurance factor [28]. Intriguingly, it was reported very recently that telomeres in cells from PARP-1 knockout mice are significantly shorter than those of wildtype mice [29], which may imply that PARP-1 acts to delay the onset of replicative senescence.

Recently we undertook an analysis of the relation tween longevity and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in [15]. We showed that maximal table PARP activity was significantly higher in bilised Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalised blastoid cell lines from of a French population of narians than in cell lines derived from control aged 20–70 years. Interestingly, specific PARP (i.e. total PARP activity corrected for the cellular of immunoreactive PARP-1 protein) was an even er parameter to distinguish between centarians and trols. In this work, we studied whether the difference served in specific PARP activity between and controls might be due to qualitative differences the level of the protein sequence, mediated by in the PARP-1 coding sequence.

ture specific for each primer (see Table 1); followed by 60°C for 4 min. Sequencing reaction products were treated with shrimp al- kaline phosphatase (Amersham) (1 U in a final volume of 20 µl) for 30 min at 37°C. DNA was precipitated in the presence of 0.4 mM MgCl and 2.5 volumes of ethanol (100%) for 15 min at 2 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 3 µl of loading buffer (form- amide 83%, EDTA 4 mM, Dextran blue 8 mg/ml). Sequencing re- action products were loaded on 4.25% polyacrylamide/6 M urea gels, and analysed on an Applied Biosystems Gene Scanner 377A for 7 h (1.5 kV, 51°C). Signals were collected by the sequence analysis software (version 3.0, Applied Biosystems) and analysed with Sequence Navigator (Applied Biosystems).

Subjects and DNA samples

Centenarians were recruited with personal consent, through the “Chronos” Project at the Fondation Jean Dausset-Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH), from all regions of France. They were Caucasians, born in France and were at least 99 years old on the day of blood collection. The mean age of the centenari- ans was 101 years. Controls were selected from unrelated Cauca- sian individuals who were born in France and matched with cente- narians for birthplace. The mean age of controls was 51 years. The proportion of women was 88.9% in the total sample tested (n=648) and 83.33% in the centenarian and control population re- spectively, reflecting the differential longevity of women and men in France. Peripheral blood leukocytes were routinely isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation, EBV-immortalised by standard methods and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until used. DNA was extracted from EBV-immortalised cell lines by standard meth- ods [30], resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH7.6) and kept frozen until used as described below.

Allele-specific amplification of the PARP-1 gene at the T1011C and T2444C loci

We analysed 648 DNA samples (324 centenarians and 324 con- trols), matched for birthplace and available in the DNA bank at Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH, by allele-specific amplification of two regions comprising the T C and T C transitions, respec- 1011 2444 tively. Each site was amplified in the presence of three primers, two of which differed only in their 3′-most nucleotide (marked in bold). T C locus: “PexC” –GCT CCT CCA GGC CAA CGC; 2444 “PexT” –GCT CCT CCA GGC CAA CGT; “Pex19” –ACC CTG TTA CCT TAA TGT CAG TTT T; T C locus: “Pex6T” –TGC 1011 AGA TCT TGG ACC GAG TAG CT; “Pex6C” –TGC AGA TCT TGG ACC GAG TAG CC; and “P2cb” –GGT TGG GTG TCT GTG TCT TG. Each one of the two “competing”, allele-specific primers for the nucleotide variation locus (i.e. PexT/PexC and Pex6T/Pex6C for T C and T C respectively) was modified at 2444 1011 the 5′ end with a fluorescent dye (C6-FAM, TET; Applied Biosys- tems dye/Eurogentec), in such a way that genotypes could easily be distinguished. PCR conditions were the following: 40 ng ge- nomic DNA, 0.2 µM each primer, 4 mM MgCl , 10 mM Tris-HCl 2 pH8.3, 50 mM KCl, 200µM each dNTP and 2.5 U Stoffel frag- ment (Perkin Elmer) in a final volume of 50 µl. Samples were de- natured for 5 min at 97°C and subjected to 30 cycles consisting of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 64°C (T C) or 65°C (T C), 30 s at 72°C. 2444 1011 PCR products (expected sizes 148 bp and 159 bp for T C and 2444 T C, respectively) were analysed on an Applied Biosystems au- 1011 tomatic sequencer A377. Sizing of the products and collection of numbers of alleles were performed as described by the manufac- turer (Genescan User’s manual, Applied Biosystems). Statistical analysis of results was done with the Chi-square test.

Sequence analysis of PARP-1 cDNA

EBV-immortalised cell lines from 18 individuals (nine centenari- ans, nine controls) were selected according to the level of PARP activity previously measured [15] (i.e. either extremely high or low PARP activity, respectively). Polyadenylated RNA was ex- tracted from up to 107 cells with the QuickPrep micro mRNA puri- fication kit (Pharmacia Biotech), resuspended in RNAse-free wa- ter and used as a template for reverse transcription with the Ready-to-go T-primed first strand kit (Pharmacia Biotech). Eight pairs of primers were designed (see Table 1) allowing the PCR- based amplification of eight overlapping stretches of DNA (rang- ing in size from 311 bp to 564 bp) spanning the complete 3,320 bp PARP-1 cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number M32721). Amplification products were purified on a Microcon micro-con- centrator (Amicon) and resuspended in water. Both strands of each purified PCR product were sequenced with the Taq DyeDeoxy ter- minator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The same primers designed for PCR amplification of cDNAs were used for sequence reactions. Reactions consisted of 25 cycles under the fol- lowing conditions: 96°C for 10 s; 5 s at the hybridisation tempera-

are indicated. The 5′- and 3′-positions of the primer′′ were given with respect to the PARP-1 cDNA sequence described by Cherney et al. [32] (GenBank accession no. M32721).

[32]. We identified four new polymorphic loci in the PARP-1 coding sequence among this sample of 18 indi- viduals. These variants were all nucleotide transitions, namely C T (exon 2), T C (exon 7), G A (exon 8) 402 1011 1215 and T C (exon 17). We did not observe any deletion, 2444 insertion or duplication events. Genotype distributions and frequencies obtained after sequence comparisons are summarised in Table 2. In the sample collection tested (n=18), genotypes corresponding to the transitions C T, G A and T C were in total linkage disequi- 402 1215 2444 librium (data not shown), whereas analysis of the fourth transition, T C, showed genotype combinations totally 1011 independent of the previous ones, strongly suggesting two independent original events. The data presented here are definite proof that the bases at positions 402, 1,011, 1,215 and 2,444 of PARP-1 coding sequence are genetic polymorphisms. Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 1, we show that the first three nucleotide transitions located in the coding region of the DNA binding domain of PARP do not lead to amino acid exchanges, whereas the T C 2444 leads to a valine-to-alanine (V762A) change in codon 762. This amino acid position is located in the catalytic domain of the enzyme.

Results

In our previous study [15], EBV-immortalised cell lines from centenarian and control individuals have been char- acterised with respect to PARP activity. Here, we select- ed and analysed 18 of these samples (nine centenarians and nine controls) in order to search for polymorphisms in the PARP-1 coding region which might be responsible for the higher specific PARP activity we have previously observed among cell lines from centenarians. Polyade- nylated mRNA was prepared from these cell lines and reverse transcribed as described in Materials and meth- ods. The complete 3,320-bp sequence of PARP-1 cDNA was then PCR amplified with eight pairs of primer, re- sulting in eight overlapping PCR products. Primer pairs were designed to avoid any non-specific amplification, including amplification of the PARP pseudogene loci as- signed to 13q34 and 14q24 [31]. The PARP-1 coding se- quence defined by Cherney et al. [32] comprises nucleo- tide positions 160 to 3,204, and primers we designed spanned this region, from nucleotide position 101 to 3,419. Using the Sequence Navigator software (Applied Biosystems), we analysed each one of these fragments, then reconstructed the total cDNA sequence for each one of the 18 individuals and compared it to the PARP-1 cDNA sequence previously described by Cherney et al.

Having discovered these polymorphisms by systemat- ic sequencing of the complete PARP-1 open reading frame, we then studied the locus T C in a larger num- 2444 ber of individuals, to evaluate the potential impact of the V762A change on human longevity, as well as on the high inter-individual variability of specific PARP activi- ty that we had previously observed [15]. Furthermore, al- though T C is silent at the protein level, it appeared to 1011 be independent of the other mutational events and we therefore decided to analyse this locus as well. In order to do this we developed an allele-specific PCR amplifi- cation, in conjunction with a fluorescent read-out system (for details see Materials and methods). To illustrate the methodology used, Fig. 2 shows an example of electrop- herograms displaying curves for fluorescently labelled PCR products. In this approach, two homologous, allele- specific, labelled primers for the locus were used, to-

gether with a third unlabelled primer hybridising with the opposite strand. Fluorescent dyes were assigned in order to distinguish allele-specific amplification products (i.e. one allele primer highlighted in blue, the other in green). PCR products were detected directly in the gel during electrophoretic separation on an Applied Biosys- tems automatic sequencer 377A. A single one-colour peak represents homozygous genotypes, whereas two merged peaks of different colour are indicative of hetero- zygous genotypes. This allele-specific amplification methodology enabled us to analyse a total of 648 DNA samples from a French population (324 centenarians and 324 controls) by PCR amplification of the loci T C 2444 and T C. We observed heterozygosity values of 1011 26.85% and 48.46%for the T C and T C loci, re- 2444 1011 spectively, in the control population (total number of al- leles, n=648). In this latter population, the calculated polymorphism information content (PIC) values were 0.22 and 0.35 for the T C and T C variants, respec- 2444 1011 tively. Allelic frequencies observed for each population, at the loci T C and T C are presented in Fig. 3. We 2444 1011 observed a perfect identity of allele frequencies between the two populations for the T C locus (Fig. 3A), 2444 whereas there was a weak and non-significant difference χ ( 2= 1.705, P=0.2) at the T C locus (Fig. 3B). Hence, 1011 the comparison of allele frequency distributions between 324 centenarians and the same number of controls clear- ly revealed the absence of any significant genetic associ- ation with human longevity, both at the T C and the 2444 T C locus. Genotype distributions for the two popula- 1011 tions are summarised in Fig. 4. We checked that geno-

in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the populations. The rarest genotype was homozygosity for allele C at both loci and for both populations (Fig. 4A, B). When we compared genotypes from the two populations, we did not detect any significant enrichment of any of the geno- types at any of the loci analysed (locus T C, 2444 χ ≥ χ 2=1.052, P 0.5; locus T C, 2=2.9, P=0.3). The lat- 1011 ter results suggest that there was no association between the long-lived phenotype and either of these two poly- morphic loci. We ruled out any sex-related difference both in the centenarian population (288 women, 36 men) and in the control sample (270 women, 54 men) regard- ing the allele and genotype frequencies for the two loci (data not shown).

Since we hypothesised that the T C transition could 2444 have a direct impact on PARP enzyme activity through the V762A point mutation, we focused the analysis on data concerning genotype distributions from individuals who had been previously tested for PARP activity [15]. None of the genotype combinations, at any locus studied, showed any association with a high or low level of maxi- mal PARP activity expressed in cpm/106 (by the Mann- Whitney test: locus T C; total n=95; T/T(n=69) versus 2444 T/C(n=19), P=0.89; T/T(n=69) versus C/C(n=7), P=0.89; T/C(n=19) versus C/C(n=7), P=0.88. Locus T C: total 1011 n=94 individuals; T/T(n=39) versus T/C(n=42), P=0.76; T/T(n=39) versus C/C(n=13), P=0.92; T/C(n=42) versus C/C(n=13), P=0.69). Moreover, no difference could be found between the values of specific PARP activity, as- sembled according to the three possible combinations of

cited studies, Western blot analyses indicated that the as- sociations with longevity were due to differences in spe- cific PARP activity rather than PARP-1 abundance. We therefore hypothesised that qualitative differences in the PARP-1 protein could be mediated by genetic differ- ences at the level of the PARP-1 gene coding sequence. Consequently, for the present study, we selected 18 do- nor samples from the population tested in our previous study [15] with extremely high or low levels of PARP activity, respectively (nine centenarians and nine con- trols). Our objective was to find new polymorphisms in the PARP-1 coding region likely to be responsible for the higher specific PARP activity observed in the cell lines from centenarians. The complete 3,320 bp sequence of PARP-1 cDNA originating from these cell lines was am- plified in eight overlapping fragments and sequenced completely. We showed that polymorphisms indeed exist in the PARP-1 coding region, and one out of the four nu- cleotide variants identified causes a change in the prima- ry structure of the protein. The T C transition in exon 2444 17 leads to the V762A exchange in the catalytic region of PARP-1 protein sequence (Fig. 1). Some nucleotide variants have already been described in the PARP-1 cod- ing sequence, but none of the polymorphisms we de- scribe here matched the nucleotide positions that were differing in the cDNA sequences presented by Auer et al.[34], Uchida et al. [35], Kurosaki et al. [36] and Cherney et al. [32]. By contrast, van Gool et al. [37] did observe the T C transition in different sequences es- 2444 tablished from independent cDNA libraries, but they did not confirm that it was a true polymorphism. In the pres-

genotype at these two loci (locus T C: total n=40 indi- 2444 viduals; T/T(n=27) versus T/C(n=11), P=0.15; T/T(n=27) versus C/C(n=2), P=0.86; T/C(n=11) versus C/C(n=2), P=0.55. Locus T C: total n=38 individuals; T/T(n=16) 1011 versus T/C(n=18), P=0.81; T/T(n=16) versus C/C(n=4), P=0.63; T/C(n=18) versus C/C(n=4), P=0.86). In conclu- sion, the results of the analysis of PARP activity as a function of observed alleles at nucleotide positions 1,011 and 2,444, did not reveal any significant differences among individuals with different genotypes.

Discussion

In two independent sets of experiments, some of us showed previously that cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity is associated with longevity. First, PARP activi- ty in permeabilised mononuclear blood cells was posi- tively correlated with lifespan in mammalian species [28] and second, in permeabilised EBV-immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines from human centenarians, PARP activity was significantly higher compared with control adults aged 20–70 [15]. These observations are in line with the hypothesis that a higher poly(ADP-ribo- syl)ation capacity would contribute to a longer lifespan of an organism, by better assuring genomic integrity and stability over chronological time [33].

One should keep in mind that the type of activity say used reflects only the synthesis but not catabolism poly(ADP-ribose) [28], the latter being catalysed by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. Moreover, in

1 cDNA of 18 individual samples gave clear proof for the presence of these polymorphisms. While the small size of the sample analysed did not allow us to interpret data as a serious association study with any kind of phe- notype, we nevertheless observed that the genotypes cor- responding to the transitions C T, G A and T C 402 1215 2444 were in total linkage disequilibrium. In contrast, the fourth transition, T C, showed genotype combinations 1011 totally independent of the previous one, suggesting two independent ancestral events. This observation made it highly interesting to analyse the two polymorphisms T C and T C in a larger population. The former, as 2444 1011 it leads to the V762A exchange, had to be compared with the PARP activity values we had already measured in the previous study. The latter, T C, even if silent at 1011 the protein sequence level, represents a potentially useful molecular tool suitable for any association or linkage analysis between the PARP-1 gene and a given pheno- type. In order to study these two sequence polymor- phisms in a larger population, it was necessary to devel- op an approach allowing us to study genomic DNA rath- er than mRNA extracted from cell lines. Therefore, we designed an allele-specific amplification method in con- junction with a fluorescent read-out system, which al- lowed us to analyse much larger numbers of samples. By using this reproducible and convenient method, we ob- tained data from 648 samples (324 centenarians and 324 controls). We calculated allele and genotype fre- quencies in each population in order to compare them, and analysed the association with human longevity. When we compared allelic frequencies and genotypes from the two populations studied, we found a clear ab- sence of genetic association with human longevity both at the T C and the T C locus. We even observed a 2444 1011 perfect identity of allele-frequencies between the two populations for the T C locus (Fig. 3). On the other 2444 hand, we expected that T C transition, which is re- 2444 sponsible for a V762A exchange in the catalytic domain of the enzyme, would influence PARP activity. Although the structural consequence of a valine-to-alanine transi- tion is expected to be rather weak, as it leads to the loss of a single methyl residue on the amino acid lateral chain, such an exchange has already been shown to mod- ify the thermo-sensitivity and finally the activity of a protein such as the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) [38]. Moreover the C-terminus region, in which V762A is located, is the region most strictly con- served during evolution of the PARP-1 protein sequence. This segment can be separated from the rest of the pro- tein, generating a 40 kDa C-terminal fragment that re- tains a basal level of catalytic activity [39]. The crystal structure of the catalytic fragment of chicken PARP-1 α has been described [40]. Residue 762 is located in the -

Hence, in order to relate a specific genotype pattern to a high or low enzyme activity, we focused on genotype distributions from individuals who had previously been tested for PARP activity. However, none of the genotype combinations, at any locus studied, showed any associa- tion either with a particularly high or low maximal PARP activity (expressed in cpm/106), or with the specific en- zyme activity.

Finally, analysis of PARP activity as a function of the observed alleles at nucleotide positions 1,011 and 2,444 of PARP-1 cDNA did not reveal any significant differ- ence between individuals with different genotypes. This suggests that the polymorphisms T C and T C do 1011 2444 not have any impact on the activity of the enzyme. Like- wise, in independent work, it was recently shown that putative differences in enzyme kinetic parameters of PARP-1, such as V and K , could not account for the max m differences observed in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation ca- pacity of human and rat cells [41], although the latter was positively correlated with lifespan of these mamma- lian species [28].

However, one should keep in mind that in the present work we have focused on seeking evidence for changes in the PARP-1 coding region that would confer increased specific activity in centenarians. Our findings might re- flect the “tip of the iceberg”, since (1) additional rare polymorphisms might exist in the coding region, and (2) additional polymorphisms might exist in the non-coding region as well – for instance, in enhancer sequences far upstream of the coding sequences. Those may have an impact on the regulation of gene expression, and, hypo- thetically, changes in PARP-1 gene expression might in- fluence the rate of PARP-1 protein turnover, and thus the functional status of PARP-1 protein.

using this reproducible and convenient method, we ob- tained data from 648 samples (324 centenarians and 324 controls). We calculated allele and genotype fre- quencies in each population in order to compare them, and analysed the association with human longevity. When we compared allelic frequencies and genotypes from the two populations studied, we found a clear ab- sence of genetic association with human longevity both at the T C and the T C locus. We even observed a 2444 1011 perfect identity of allele-frequencies between the two populations for the T C locus (Fig. 3).

This segment can be separated from the rest of the pro- tein, generating a 40 kDa C-terminal fragment that re- tains a basal level of catalytic activity [39]. The crystal structure of the catalytic fragment of chicken PARP-1 α has been described [40]. Residue 762 is located in the - helical domain of the catalytic fragment of PARP-1. As depicted in Fig. 5, (G. de Murcia, personal communica- tion), the closest neighbour of residue 762 is G888. This amino acid is part of the PARP-1 signature (active site) and is totally conserved during evolution. The distance

polymorphisms have to be considered that could account for the differences observed in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity between centenarian and control cells. Recently, the in vitro modulation of PARP-1 activity by protein partners has been described. Caldecott et al. [42], and more recently Masson et al. [25], identified PARP-1 as the third partner (in addition to DNA ligase III and DNA β polymerase ) of the base excision repair protein, X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1). The interaction between PARP-1 and XRCC1 resulted in the inhibition of the catalytic activity of PARP-1 as well as of its auto- modification level, without modifying the level of pro- tein expression or PARP-1 nick sensor function [25]. On the other hand, the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) has been reported to act as a positive regulator of PARP-1 activity in vitro [43].

Finally, the description of several novel PARP homo- logues in mammalians has highlighted the possibility of functional redundancies in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation system [19, 20,21]. At least one of the new PARP homo- logues (i.e. PARP-2 [21]) synthesises poly(ADP-ribose) in a DNA-dependent manner. Hence, the global PARP

activity measured in our assay system might in fact re- flect the presence of at least two enzymatic activities (PARP-1 and PARP-2).
