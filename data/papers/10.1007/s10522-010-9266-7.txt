protect from asthma and other pulmonary diseases and lead to a reduced activation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Moreover, the low level of adenosine may potentiate the activity of NK and other cellular effectors against tumor cells. The negligible effect of ADA genetic polymorphism in females suggest a marginal influence of genetic factors in determining longevity in this sex, confirming previous reports.

Abstract Aim of this study was to investigate whether the polymorphic ADA (Adenosine Deami- nase, EC 3.5.4.4) gene, which determines the cellular level of adenosine and plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune system and in the control of metabolic rates, is involved in longevity. 884 unrelated healthy individuals (age range 10–106 years, 400 males and 484females) from central Italy were studied. ADA genotyping was performed by RFLP-PCR. Fre- quency distributions were compared using the chi- square test and a three-way contingency table analysis by a log linear model was applied to test independence between the variables. We found that ADA influences human life-span in a sex and age specific way. An increased frequency of ADA*2 carriers was found in males aged 80–85, and a decreased frequency in males over 85 (v2 = 13.93; df = 3; P = 0.003); significant differences among the age groups was not found in females. A strong interaction among age groups, ADA genotype and sex (G = 15.086; df = 3; P = 0.0017) was found. Males aged 80–85 could be protected from ischemic stroke by higher levels of adenosine (deter- mined by the ADA*2 allele). The decrease of ADA*2 carriers in males over 85 may depend essentially on immunological factors; reduced levels of adenosine

Introduction

During the last decade, experimental evidence has confirmed the profound impact of oxidative stress and immunosenescence on human life expectancy. Numerous epidemiological data indicate that longev- ity is largely determined by genetic factors and a number of possible associations between longevity and allelic variants of genes have been described. Long-lived individuals may lack numerous gene variants that are associated with premature mortality, and may also be carriers of protective variants (Scha¨chter 1998; Salvioli et al. 2006).

The ADA gene, encoding Adenosine Deaminase (ID 100; EC reference number EC 3.5.4.4), the enzyme that

inosine, is an excellent candidate for determining human longevity. In fact, its crucial role in the regulation of the immune system and in the control of metabolic rates is well known. Individuals carrying congenital defects of ADA are affected by severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; OMIM 102700) characterized by the absence of functional T and B lymphocytes. In humans, ADA is located in the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q13.11) and its product is a polymorphic enzyme due to a G to A transition at nucleotide 22 of exon 1 which gives rise to an Asp (allele 1*) to Asn (allele 2*) amino acid substitution at position 8 of the mature protein. The enzymatic activity of ADA-Asn is *35% lower than that of the ADA-Asp allele (Battistuzzi et al. 1974). The fre- quency of the ADA*2 allele is estimated to be 0.06 in Westernpopulations, but is lower among individualsof African descent and higher in Southeast Asian popu- lations. The occurrence of the ADA*2 allele in at least two different genetic backgrounds, the Jewish Ashke- nazi and a large Mormon pedigree from Utah, suggests an independent recurrence of the G [ A mutation (Hirschhorn et al. 1994). Consistent with the indepen- dent recurrence of this mutation is the fact that the G- to-A transition occurs in a‘‘hotspot’’ CpG dinucleotide which is subject to a high mutation frequency.

Subjects

Eight hundred and eighty four unrelated healthy individuals randomly selected from the same geo- graphical area of central Italy were studied. Health status information obtained for all individuals indi- cated that no acute pathological condition was present. Almost all subjects up to age 65 were recruited in blood donor centers while those over 65 were recruited through family physicians or among guests in homes for the elderly. The subjects were divided into four age groups: 272 subjects\70 years (131 males and 141 females, mean age 49.8 ± 14.9), 280 subjects 80–85 years (143 males and 137 females, mean age 82.4 ± 1.6), 162 subjects 86–90 (64 males and 98 females, mean age 88.1 ± 1.5) and 170 subjects [90 years (62 males and 108 females, mean age 95.8 ± 2.5). The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Camerino University.

Carriers of the ADA*2 allele show reduced enzy- matic activity and consequently, a higher level of both circulating and intra-cellular adenosine, a situ- ation which may have a number of consequences. In fact, this purine nucleoside present in plasma and other extracellular fluids, is an important local hormone (like prostaglandins) which regulates immu- nological functions, blood flow, neurotransmission, smooth muscle physiology and platelet aggregation. Recent studies have also shown interesting interplays between adenosine and insulin. In the liver adenosine activates A2B receptors and counteracts the action of insulin (Yasuda et al. 2003) whereas it seems to facilitate insulin action in the adipocyte. The aden- osine deaminase complex protein (Kameoka et al. 1993) is identical to CD26, a T–cell-activating antigen and a glycoprotein present in epithelial cells of various tissues. Data also suggest that ADA and CD26 are co-localized on the surface but not inside T-cells. Cells expressing ADA and CD26 on their surface are much more resistant to the inhibitory effects of adenosine (Dong et al. 1996).

ADA genotyping

Genomic DNA was extracted according to Miller et al. (1988) and stored at -20(cid:3)C prior to gene analysis. Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR with primers flanking the G22A polymorphic region: 50-GCCCG GCCCGTTAAGAAGAGC-30 as sense primer, and 50-GGTCAAGTCAGGGGCAGAAGCAGA-30 as antisense primer (GenBank accession No. M13792). These primers yielded a 397 bp PCR product in a 20 ll reaction mixture containing 1,5 ll of template DNA, 0.6 U Phusion High Fidelty-DNA polymerase (Finn- zymes, Finland), 0.6 ll of DMSO 100%, 0.5 lM of each primer and a final concentration of 200 lM dNTPs and 1 9 Phusion HF buffer (Finnzymes). The amplification reaction was performed on a Biometra T-gradient thermal-cycler with initial denaturation at 98(cid:3)C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of a two-step PCR protocol consisting of denaturation step at 98(cid:3)C for 15 s and one annealing/extension step at 72(cid:3)C for

15 s, with a final extension time of 5 min at 72(cid:3)C. The PCR product were digested with TaqI (Promega) for 90 min at 65(cid:3)C, and the sample were electrophoresed in a 1.8% agarose gel. The PCR product of the ADA*1 (G22) allele was cleaved into 245-bp and 152-bp fragments. The ADA*2 (A22) allele was identified by the lack of a Taq I restriction site.

Statistical analysis

The ADA genotypic distribution was tested for accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A chi-square test of independence was used to evaluate the differences in ADA genotypic distribu- tion between the four age groups. Three-way contin- gency table analysis was done by a log-linear model according to Sokal and Rohlf (1981). Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 1992).

Results

The distribution of the ADA genotype in individuals aged\71, 80–85, 86–90 and[90 is shown in Table 1; the maximum age in males and females in our sample population was 100 and 106 respectively. Allelic and genotypic frequencies are in Hardy–Weinberg equi- librium, regardless of whether males and females are considered together (v2 = 0.649, df = 1, P = 0.420), or separately (males: v2 = 0.017, df = 1, P = 0.896; females: v2 = 0.889, df = 1, P = 0.346).

v2 = 5.45, d.f. = 3, P = 0.14166

As seen in Table 2, compared to the control group (i.e. age \ 71), there is an increased number of ADA*2 allele carriers in the population of long-lived males aged 80–85, while among the males aged[85 there is a decrease of ADA*2 allele carriers (v2 = 13.93; df = 3; P = 0.003).

The distribution of the ADA genotype in female subjects belonging to different age groups is pre- sented in Table 3. Unlike the situation observed with males, the ADA genotype distribution does not show any significant difference between the groups (v2 = 5.45; df = 3; P = 0.142). A relative decrease in the number of ADA*2 carriers in the group of females aged 80–85 was found not to be statistically significant.

A significant interaction among age groups, ADA genotype distribution and sex (G = 15.086; df = 3; P = 0.00177) is shown by a three way contingency table analysis by a log linear model (Table 4). More- over, this table shows an increase of male ADA*2 carriers in the 80–85 age group (males 22.4% vs females 12.4%) and a decrease of these genotypes in the 86–90 and[90 age groups (males 9.4% vs females 16.3%; males 4.8% vs females 15.7%).

Moreover, cytokines and can increase the expression of lung aden- receptors, determining a positive feedback can increase inflammation (Husza´r et al. Zhong et al. 2006).

This phenomenon would be enhanced in the ADA 2-1 carriers who are by having a lower adenosine deaminase

Discussion

The significant increase of ADA 2-1 subjects detected in males aged 80–85 is likely due to the protective effect of the elevated cellular concentrations of adenosine during ischemic attack, whose occurrence drastically increases in this period of life. Indeed, adenosine accumulates during brain ischemia and has vasodilation and neuroprotective effects (Heistad et al. 1981). Furthermore, the report that the level of plasma adenosine increases following an ischemic stroke (Laghi Pasini et al. 2000), can be correlated with the finding that, compared to women, men undergoing an ischemic stroke experience a reduction in plasma ADA activity (Tavilani et al. 2008). It is possible that such a reduction is an adaptive mech- anism to protect the male brain from ischemic injury through an increase in adenosine availability.

type on female longevity beyond age 85, we suggest that this might be due to the action of estrogens throughout their entire life, in light of the beneficial effects of estrogens on the vascular system (Mendel- sohn and Karas 1999; Vin˜a et al. 2005; Weidemann and Hanke 2002) brought about by the reduction of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increase in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cho- lesterol that they cause. So, unlike men, women are less subject to vascular damage and therefore are less sensitive to the consequences of the ADA 2-1 genotype and to the cellular concentration of aden- osine. On the other hand, it is possible that women over age 85 might respond to the sex-specific differences in thymic output (Pido-Lopez et al. 2001). It has been shown that thymic involution occur more rapidly in males than in females. Thus, if one assumes that thymus involution plays a central role in the development of an immunological risk profile and that ADA deficiency increases thymic

As regards the reduction of ADA 2-1 genotype in [85 males, we suggest that it is probably due to the higher level of cellular adenosine determined by above-mentioned genotype. In fact, adenosine trig- gers the release of IL-6, a disability and mortality predictor among the elderly, as well as IL-1b, a pro- inflammatory molecule associated with poor physical performance and diminished muscle strength in older persons (Sun et al. 2008). Higher levels of adenosine were also found to be positively correlated with the

genotypes in [85 females have an immunological advantage over the ADA 2-1 males of the same age. The above premises, and the negligible, not statisti- cally significant reduction of the ADA 2-1 genotype in females in the 80–85 age group point to the marginal relevance of ADA activity in the pathways that influence longevity in this gender. More generally, these notions are in line with the published evidence that variability of genetic factors contributes to determining the phenotype much more in males than in females and that female longevity is less dependent than male longevity on hereditary factors (Bellizzi et al. 2005; De Luca et al. 2001; Ivanova et al. 1998; Passarino et al. 2006; Tan et al. 2001).

Thus, it is likely that males and females follow different routes to attain longevity and that female longevity has a lower genetic component with respect to males. The better life-style and more favourable environmental factors which have characterised western society over the last century may have then benefited women more than males and, consequently, further reduced the genetic component of female longevity (Guralnik et al. 2000; Montesanto et al.
