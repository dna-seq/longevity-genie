of cardiovascular diseases, and mortality in a four-year prospective study. The study included 4000 community-living men and women aged 65 years and over, and detailed information regarding lifestyle, chronic diseases, body mass index (BMI), ABI measurements, and ACE polymorphisms were documented at baseline. During the fifth year of follow-up, incident cardiovascular diseases, ABI, and mortality were documented and related to ACE genotype adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol, dietary intake, physical activity, body mass index, and use of ACE inhibitors.

The results showed that women with the D/D genotype had the greatest reduction in mean ABI after adjusting for confounding factors. The D/D genotype was also more common among women who developed hypertension or myocardial infarction. However, the D/D genotype was associated with mortality only in men. In conclusion, in a Chinese elderly population, ACE polymorphism may be considered deleterious to longevity. The D/D genotype was associated with mortality, the atherosclerotic process, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. There are gender differences in the relationship between D/D genotype variations.

The renin-angiotensin system blockade has been considered a cornerstone of strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk through antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and oxidative stress-lowering actions (1). Therefore it might be expected that ACE gene polymorphisms resulting in increased ACE activity would be associated with the atherosclerotic process and consequently cardiovascular diseases and mortality.

In vitro studies showed that endothelial cells carrying the I/I (homozygote for Alu insertion) genotype of the ACE Alu polymorphism had lower angiotensin II levels and a twenty-fold increased viability after slow starvation compared with cells with the D/D (homozygote for deletion) genotype (2). Association between ACE polymorphism and ankle-brachial index, an indicator of atherosclerosis, has also been documented (3).

Various population studies showed that the D/D genotype confers an increased risk of hypertension (4-10) and cardiovascular disease (4,11), although there was a suggestion that the association may be stronger among Asians compared with Caucasians, and that there was a gender difference in the association. However, other studies reported no association (12), and a meta-analysis among Caucasians concluded that although ACE gene polymorphisms affect plasma ACE activity, an association of the polymorphism with hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, or ischemic heart disease was not observed in large studies but only in small ones (4). Inconsistent results were also observed.

With respect to mortality, the concept of deleterious versus longevity-enabling genes in defining life expectancy (16) has emerged based on population studies of associations between gene polymorphisms and survival. However, the association between ACE polymorphism and mortality is not clear-cut. Some studies have concluded that the D/D genotype is deleterious to survival based on observations of declining frequency of this polymorphism in successively older age groups (17-19). On the contrary, a higher frequency of the D allele was observed among centenarians (20, 21), while others reported no change in frequency of the D allele as a function of age (12). Differences in gender and ethnicity were also observed. To address some of the methodological issues that may account for previous conflicting findings, we examined the contribution of ACE polymorphism in a large Chinese population to change in ankle-brachial index, development of cardiovascular diseases, and mortality in a four-year prospective study.The study aimed to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular diseases and 4-year mortality prospectively, while adjusting for environmental confounding factors such as dietary and alcohol intake, physical activity, and more. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from the 4000 men and women aged 65 and over who were invited to attend a health check in the School of Public Health of the university. Recruitment notices were placed in community centers for the elderly and housing estates, and several talks were given to explain the purpose, procedures, and investigations to be carried out. Subjects who were unable to walk without assistance or had bilateral hip replacements were excluded from the stratified sample, which aimed to recruit approximately one third from each of these age groups: 65-69, 70-74, 75+. The study sample differed from the general Hong Kong population of the same age group in that they were more educated and more likely to be married. The study commenced in 2001, and after five years of follow-up, the results are reported in this study. During this period, 614 subjects did not return for follow-up, while 233 subjects died (Fig 1). There was no difference in frequencies of the three ACE gene polymorphisms between participants who returned. 

At baseline, a 10ml venous blood specimen was collected from 1841 men and 1957 women and placed into EDTA tubes. Blood samples were stored at -70C until DNA extraction (within one year after collection). Genomic DNA was extracted for genotyping of Alu insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene by polymerase chain reaction with forward and reverse primers (5'- AGAGAGACTCAAGCACGCCC-3' and 5'- ACCCAAGTGCCAGTGATGTT-3'). Reactions were set up in a volume of 25 ml containing 0.2 mM of each primer, 1X PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2mM of each dNTP, and 0.6 U Taq polymerase (Fermentas Life Sciences). About 50 ng of DNA was used in each sample. The initial denaturation was performed at 95oC for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94oC for 30 sec, 64oC for 30 sec, and 72oC for 30 sec, and a final extension at 72oC for 10 min. This method yielded amplification products of 439 bp for the D allele and 727 bp for the I allele, which were visualized in 2% agarose gels. 

The chi-square test was used to test for statistical differences between categorical variables, while student's t-test and analysis of variance were used for continuous variables between the three genotype groups. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust for confounding variables while adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. The incidence of disease was calculated as the number without disease at baseline who developed it at follow-up. Cox regression analysis was used to examine mortality rates between the three genotype groups using a proportional hazard model.

At baseline, participants completed a questionnaire that included demographics, history of chronic disease, use of ACE inhibitors, smoking habits, physical activity level assessed using the Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly (PASE) (22), and dietary intake assessed using a food frequency questionnaire administered by an interviewer (23). Body weight was measured with subjects wearing a light gown using the Physical Balance Beam Scale (Healthometer, Bridgeview, Illinois, USA), while height was measured using the Holtain Harpenden stadiometer (Holtain Ltd., Crosswell, UK). Supine blood pressure was measured in the right arm and both ankles using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and a handheld Doppler with an 8-MHz Doppler probe (Pocket Doppler Model 841-A, Parks Medical Electronics Inc, Aloha, Or, USA). The average reading of two measurements at each site was used. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was calculated by dividing the blood pressure at the posterior tibial site by the brachial artery site for each side, and the lowest of the two values was used. An ABI value of <0.9 has been used as a cutoff value to indicate the presence of peripheral vascular disease (24).Also, as an indicator of atherosclerosis (25), the procedure was carried out for 1999 men and 1999 women, and the baseline results are reported elsewhere (26). During the fifth year of follow-up, participants returned, and a medical history was obtained, and ABI measurement was repeated. The Death Registry was searched. ACE gene polymorphism results were available in 1841 men and 1957 women from whom blood samples for DNA extraction had been obtained. For men, the frequencies of I/I, I/D, and D/D genotypes were 815/1841 (44.3%), 842/1841 (45.7%), and 184/1841 (9.9%), respectively. Genotype distributions in both sexes followed Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. For women, the frequencies were 46%, 43%, and 10.9%, respectively. The percentage of subjects with ABI <0.9 did not differ significantly between the three polymorphism groups. Mean ABI, the percentage of subjects with ABI <0.9, and potential confounders in the relationship between genetic factors and ABI are listed by genotype groups in Table 1a & b. In women only, participants with the D/D genotype had the greatest reduction in mean ABI value. This group also had the highest mean age. After adjusting for all potential confounding factors, the D/D group had the greatest progression of atherosclerosis (using reduction in ABI as an indicator), followed by I/I and I/D groups (Table 2). No significant variations were found across the three polymorphism groups in men or women for any of the variables listed in Table 1a & b.This text appears to be a table, but it is not properly formatted. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning of the data. However, I can make some general observations and corrections:

- There are several misspelled words, but it is difficult to correct them without context.
- There are several abbreviations that are not explained, which makes it difficult to understand the data.
- The text seems to be reporting statistical data, but there are several missing labels and units of measurement.
- The text contains several unnecessary spaces and hyphens that should be removed.

Without further context or information about the data, it is not possible to make more specific corrections.in the genotype frequencies with age may occur in younger populations.

Confounding variables, including age, BMI, PASE, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, use of ACE inhibitors, smoking, alcohol use, and dietary intake of saturated fatty acids were analyzed. The results showed no significant differences in incidence of disease between those with different ACE genotypes. However, D/D was more common among women developing hypertension or myocardial infarction. In terms of mortality, more men with the D/D genotype had died by the 5th year follow-up compared to the I/I or I/D group.

The study has some limitations. The older population studied did not include those who may have physical limitations and thus were not able to attend the study center. The medical history relied on participants' reports of doctors' diagnoses. No electrocardiograms or physical examinations were carried out other than height, weight and blood pressure measurements. The low number of participants with the D/D genotype and the relatively short duration of follow-up are also limitations.

However, the study has several strengths and contributes to existing inconsistent literature regarding ACE polymorphism, longevity, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. The large number of men and women, the prospective design, the availability of ABI measurement, and the adjustment for many confounding environmental factors address some of the underlying reasons for inconsistencies in previous studies. In particular, we were able to document many nutritional factors associated with cardiovascular disease in detail.

The lower frequency of the D/D genotype relative to I/I & I/D in this population is compatible with previous observations of lower frequency of D/D among Asians (17.9%) compared with Blacks (37.9%) and Whites (32.5%). The genotype frequencies did not vary significantly with age, which is a finding similar to that of a large Danish study of all ages and among Japanese but contrary to other studies among Europeans and Colombians and the finding of higher frequencies of the D allele among centenarians. However, this study only included participants age 65 years and older, and changes in the genotype frequencies with age may occur in younger populations.Frequency changes with age may not be detected within this narrow age range. The study did not include centenarians, and the population represented fitter individuals who were able to survive. In conclusion, the ACE polymorphism may be considered deleterious to longevity in a Chinese elderly population, with the D/D genotype being associated with mortality, the atherosclerotic process, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. However, there are gender differences, and mortality may not be mediated by the atherosclerotic process alone. A longer period of follow-up may yield further information. In the meantime, therapeutic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may possibly have a role in reducing cardiovascular disease incidence. The lower mean ABI values in women have not been observed in other populations, although it is known that there is a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women after menopause. This finding may reflect a survivor effect in men or a true association. The association between D/D genotype and greater progression of atherosclerosis and incidence of hypertension and myocardial infarction in a large number of women only confirms some previous observations that this association may be stronger among Asians, that there is a gender difference, and that there may be differences between ethnic groups. The fact that this was a prospective study consisting of large numbers of men and women strengthens the validity of this observation and supports the hypothesis that increased ACE activity (associated with the D/D genotype) accelerates the atherosclerotic process and consequently the onset of cardiovascular diseases. Possible explanations for the lack of association in men may be that other environmental factors are at play.

Newman AB, Siscovick DS, ManolioIn elderly Chinese populations, atherosclerosis is a common condition. Several studies have investigated the association between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and cardiovascular and renal risk. One study found an association between the ACE gene polymorphism and age in two ethnic groups living in Brazil's southern region. Meta-analyses of small and large studies in whites have also shown an association between ACE gene polymorphism and cardiovascular disease. However, other studies have found no association between ACE gene polymorphism and essential hypertension in Belgian and Chinese populations. Variation at the ACE gene locus has been linked to blood pressure in Finnish men, increased risk of essential hypertension in Japanese men, and blood pressure response to hydrochlorothiazide in both genders. Large-scale tests have found no significant association between ACE gene polymorphism and myocardial infarction in cases and controls. Another study found no association between ACE gene polymorphism and ischemic heart disease or longevity in individuals based on the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Finally, some studies have investigated the prevalence of alleles and genotypes in the renin-angiotensin system but found no association with renal function among Chinese patients with type II diabetes.
