age from the municipality of Treviso, a small city in the SIRT3 northeast of Italy. We genotyped rs3825075, rs4980329, and rs11555236 single nucleotide polymor- phisms (SNPs) by real-time polymerase chain reaction allelic discrimination assay. A cross-sectional analysis performed by comparing people over and under 85 years of age did not evidence association among the SIRT3 SNPs and longevity. However, when we performed a longitudinal analysis considering mortality as a depen- SIRT3 dent variable, we observed an association of rs11555236 and rs4980329 with longevity in the whole p population ( values corrected for potential con- founders=0.04 and 0.03, respectively). After stratifica- tion according to gender, the same SNPs were associat- p ed to female longevity only ( values corrected for potential confounders=0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Finally, as rs11555236 was reported to be in linkage disequilibrium with a putative functional enhancer with- SIRT3 in the gene, we assessed whether rs11555236 genotypes correlated with a different level of SIRT3

protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found an increased level of SIRT3 in subjects homozygous for SIRT3 the (T) allele. We suggest that genetic variability might be relevant for the modulation of human longev- ity in the Italian population.

Background

proteins sharing NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity that seems involved in several basic physiologic mecha- nisms and relevant for age-linked diseases (Albani et al. 2010; Polito et al. 2010). Among SIRTs, SIRT3 is a mitochondrial protein involved in defensive mechanisms against oxidative stress (Yu et al. 2012; Bause and Haigis 2012; Iwahara et al. 2012). Considering that oxidative stress increase is a basic feature of aging, SIRT3 may have a role in modulating longevity, a hypothesis sup- ported by evidence in an animal model, where the dis- ruption of the gene coding for angiotensin II receptor type 1A resulted in marked prolongation of life span in mice, with an increased number of mitochondria in the kidney SIRT3 and upregulation of prosurvival genes (including ) (Benigni et al. 2009). Moreover, genetic association stud- SIRT3 ies pointed out a role for in human longevity. The SIRT3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11555236 minor allele (T) increased male survival in an Italian cohort from Calabria and was found in linkage disequilibrium with a putative enhancer located within SIRT3 intron 5 (Bellizzi et al. 2005; Rose et al. 2003). In a different multicentre study that recruited centenarians from Italy and Germany (for a total of 1,321 centenarians SIRT3 and 1,140 younger subjects), some SNPs in showed significant association with longevity in the Italian female and in the German male subgroups, al- though this result was not supported by a replication enrolling centenarians of French ancestry (Lescai et al. 2009). Moreover, in a study analyzing genetic variants of the oldest old, a list of SIRT3 SNPs was detailed in long- living individuals of Caucasian ancestry (Halaschek- Wiener et al. 2009). Starting from the evidence SIRT3 supporting an involvement of in longevity, we SIRT3 genotyped three SNPs of in an ongoing prospec- tive study enrolling an elderly population (Treviso Longeva (TRELONG) study; Gallucci et al. 2007).

2009). Rs11555236 was already linked to longevity in the Italian population (Bellizzi et al. 2005; Rose et al. 2003). To assess rs3825075, rs4980329, and rs11555236 genotypes, a gDNA aliquot (about 20 ng) was used in an allelic discrimination assay using a real-time PCR appa- ratus and TaqMan technology according to the manufac- turer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The successful genotyping rate was around 92 %. Subjects' genotypes were independently confirmed in a random sample representing 10 % of the population, with 100 % replication rate. Subjects who were not genotyped were equally distributed in the TRELONG population (subjects belonged to almost all the age brackets) and had no peculiar demographic or survival features in compar- ison to the genotyped population.

Materials and methods

Population

A thorough description of the TRELONG study has already been reported (Gallucci et al. 2007). In short, after the selection of the 13,861 Treviso inhabitants over 70 years of age (17 % of total inhabitants) from the residents listed in the Registry Office of Treviso, partic- ipants were systematically sampled, planning to include 100 participants according to gender and 10-year-age – group, 125 women and 125 men aged 70 79 years, and all people over 100 years. A total of 668 people were selected: 311 men and 357 women (mean age 84.0 – ±8.0 years, range 70.0 105.5 years). A 7-year follow-up was then performed. Included subjects underwent exam- ination from the biologic, clinical, and socioeconomic point of view. A blood sample was collected and each participant was administered with a structured interview. The study protocol, blood collection procedure, and the questionnaire to be administered at home were submitted to and approved by the ethical committee of the National Institute on Research and Care of the Elderly (INRCA, Italy). The protocol included a written informed consent for clinical and genetic studies.

Protein extraction and Western blotting

sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophore- sis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The mem- brane was incubated overnight with a primary antibody diluted in 5 % nonfat dried milk in PBS + 0.1 % Tween- 20 (PBS-T). After washing, the membrane was incubat- ed for 1 h with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:5,000 in 5 % nonfat dried milk in PBS-T. The membrane was finally subjected to chemiluminescence detection using an enhanced re- agent (electrochemiluminescence (ECL) Millipore, Billerica, CA, USA). To quantitatively assess SIRT3 immunoreactivity, the ECL signal was measured by a densitometric method setup by a free image analyzer program (ImageJ, http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), using an α internal normalization control ( -tubulin).

Fasting peripheral blood samples (30 mL) were col- lected by venipuncture; one aliquot was used to sepa- rate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by a standard Ficoll centrifugation procedure. PBMC pel- lets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), divided into aliquots and stored at − 80 °C for further analysis. From the enrolled popula- tion of 668 subjects, 590 gave their consent for blood collection and PBMC preparation.

Antibodies

Genomic DNAwas extracted from PBMC pellet using a vacuum-based semiautomated nucleic acid extractor (AB6100, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), checked for concentration by a UV spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and stored at 4 °C.

The following primary antibodies were used to run α immunoblotting: anti- -tubulin monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:5,000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti- SIRT3 polyclonal antibody (dilution 1:1,000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

SIRT3 We decided to assess rs3825075, rs4980329, and rs11555236 as the first two ones (which we geno- typed in a previous study (Polito et al. 2013)) captured the variation of rs511744 and rs11246020, respectively, that were reported to be overrepresented in long-living elderly of Caucasian ancestry (Halaschek-Wiener et al.

Genotypic and allelic frequency distributions and depar- – ture from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium were assessed

the considered groups, even after gender stratification (data not shown).

– Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard model. The propor- tional hazard has been tested using Schoenfeld's residual test, and it has never been rejected, thus confirming the suitability of the model. Multivariate re- gression analysis was performed considering mortality as dependent variable. These statistic analyses were com- “ ” “ ” puted using the package survival of the R software. After correction for possible confounders (diabetes, car- diovascular diseases, cerebral vasculopathies, cancer, cholesterol level, scholarity, age, and gender), results p were considered significant at <0.05, using two-tailed tests of significance.

Prospective analysis

the TRELONG study features a longitudinal follow- SIRT3 with mortality data, we decided to reanalyze variability considering mortality as a dependent and plotting survival curves according to genotype (Fig. 1). As mortality might be several other variables, we controlled for TRELONG disorders (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, vasculopathies, and cancer), risk factors (cho- level, scholarity), age, and gender. We found between rs4980329 and survival, with allele (A) giving an advantage for longevity. HRs, considering the major allele homozy- genotype as reference, were 1.08 and 0.66 for (GA) (AA) genotypes, respectively. A second found for rs11555236, with the minor allele (T) an advantage. For this polymorphism, the using the major allele homozygous genotype were 1.18 and 0.58, respectively. No found for rs3825075. To investigate whether these had a different outcome in males or females, performed a gender-stratified analysis, correcting for the other variables influencing survival listed plots of the TRELONG population according to are shown in Fig. 2. We found a significant effect rs4980329 and rs11555236 minor alleles for p p (corrected values and HR: value, 0.02; HR,

Results

Cross-sectional analysis

We started evaluating the correlation of rs3825075, rs4980329, and rs11555236 with longevity by splitting the TRELONG population around 85 years of age, basing on the previous evidence from the same study (Albani et al. 2009, 2011). Results of this analysis – are reported in Table 1. Each SNP was in Hardy p Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) ( =0.82, 0.71, and 0.93 for χ2 test assessing departure from HWE, respectively). Genotypic and allelic frequencies did not differ between

(Bellizzi et al. 2005), we decided to assess whether the rs11555236 genotype correlated with a SIRT3 modulation of expression level. We focused on the SIRT3 isoform having a molecular weight of around 30 kDa that is considered the fully active pro- tein relevant for mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis (Hallows et al. 2008). We analyzed SIRT3 protein level by Western blotting in PBMCs from the TRELONG n population, building up three groups ( =10 subjects

Longevity is a complex phenotype arising from multiple variables, and genetic background plays a pivotal role not only for a deterministic control on hereditary disor- ders, but also in modulating the individual response to environmental hits and drug therapies (Eaton et al. 2012; Murabito et al. 2012; Chung et al. 2010; Seripa et al. 2010).

Our experimental allows to consider these SNPs as alternative to be genotyped in association to longevity. fact that these polymorphisms were associated to in the whole population but under gender in females only might tune down their to survival, but we and others have already several cases of analogous outcome after stratification (Albani et al. 2009; Napolioni al. 2011; Anselmi et al. 2009; Cederholm et al.

linked to increased survival at oldest ages (Tazearslan SIRT3 et al. 2012). To this respect, deserves attention both for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, a funda- mental aspect of cell physiology, and for the available SIRT3 data associating to survival in animal models or in the elderly (Benigni et al. 2009; Halaschek-Wiener et al. 2009; Rose et al. 2003; Bellizzi et al. 2005). We have decided to analyze an informative set of SNPs of SIRT3 gene in a prospective study (TRELONG) allowing us to have access to survival data over a 7- year follow-up. This work has been carried out in a unique group of subjects: a community-based popula- tion with the highest longevity rates in Italy (Gallucci et al. 2007). To this respect, our analysis reflects closely SIRT3 the correlation between and longevity in the Italian population in the real world. As in a previous genetic study performed in our laboratory where we had SIRT3 already investigated a panel of SNPs (Polito et al. 2013), we decided to select from this panel those SIRT3 matching or tagging a list of genetic variants whose presence was highlighted in a population of Caucasian elderly, suggesting their involvement in a prosurvival background (Halaschek-Wiener et al. 2009). Thanks to the existence of linkage disequilibrium SIRT3 blocks within , we were able to choose a couple of SNPs from Polito et al. (2012) (rs3825075 and rs4980329) that were linked to the SNPs rs511744 and rs11246020 reported by Halaschek-Wiener et al. (2009; Fig. 1). The third SNP, rs11555236, was linked to longevity in an Italian study and supposed to be in linkage disequilibrium with a putative functional enhanc- er (a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) SIRT3 element) located within intron 5 (Bellizzi et al. 2005). The cross-sectional association study was performed by splitting the TRELONG population around 85 years, a critical point discriminating long-living in- dividuals that has allowed us to find other informative genetic variability in the same population (Albani et al. 2009). However, no association was found with this experimental design. To reanalyze data taking into ac- count the real survival curve of each subject, a prospec- tive analysis was conducted by inputting mortality data of the TRELONG study over a 7-year follow-up. The main result was the association between rs11555236 and

ture, we have not performed in the present study the assessment of the putative VNTR enhancer element of SIRT3 gene described by Bellizzi et al. (2005), but taking advantage from its reported linkage disequilib- rium with rs11555236, we decided to further investi- gate the functional action of the VNTR element in a group of TRELONG subjects bearing the rs11555236 variants. We hypothesized that some sequences of the cis SIRT3 VNTR element acted as a -enhancer on gene, leading to an increase of SIRT3 protein level. We verified this by measuring SIRT3 protein expression in PBMCs, as this was the only available tissue spec- imen from the TRELONG study. Our observation that the (T) allele, that correlated with longevity, was also associated to an increased level of SIRT3 protein is intriguing, as it might suggest that increased SIRT3 level is beneficial, as expected from the current knowl- edge on this protein functions, dealing with response to oxidative stress and control of the mitochondrial acetylome (Bause and Haigis 2012; Fritz et al. 2012).

We acknowledge that this assessment suffers from limitations; first of all, the lack of independent tissue source to confirm a widespread and not tissue-specific effect. Moreover, we are not able to rule out the possi- bility that other genetic or epigenetic modulations oc- curring in PBMC might have affected the transcription SIRT3 rate of the gene. Finally, the exact VNTR se- quence linked to rs11555236 (T) allele should be fur- ther investigated.

In summary, this study points to an involvement of SIRT3 variability in human longevity, with a particular SIRT3 emphasis on the role of the rs11555236 poly- morphic site as a genetic and functional marker.
