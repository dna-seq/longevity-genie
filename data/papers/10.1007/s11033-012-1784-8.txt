total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein than did mt146C in the older age group (P \ 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the mt146C and the mt146T individuals in the middle and the younger groups (P [ 0.05). The mt5178C/A polymorphisms did not show any significant differences among the three age- groups (P [ 0.05), but different nationalities in the Bama County did show a significant difference in the mt5178C/A polymorphisms (P \ 0.05). These results suggest that the mt146T/C polymorphisms in Guangxi Bama individuals may partly account for the Bama longevity whereas the mt5178C/A polymorphisms are strongly associated with the nationalities in the Guangxi Bama population.

Abstract Human longevity is an interesting and com- plicated subject, with many associated variations, geo- graphic and genetic, including some known mitochondrial variations. The population of the Bama County of Guangxi Province of China is well known for its longevity and serves as a good model for studying a potential molecular mechanism. In this study, a full sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been done in ten Bama centenarians using direct sequencing. Polymorphisms of the displacement loop (D-loop) region of mtDNA and several serum parameters were analyzed for a total of 313 Bama individuals with ages between 10 and 110 years. The results showed that there were seven mitochondrial varia- tions, A73G, A263G, A2076G, A8860G, G11719A, C14766T, and A15326G, and four haplogroups, M*, F1, D* and D in 10 Bama centenarians. In the D-loop region 4 of mtDNA, the mt146T occurred at a significantly lower frequency in those is the older age group (90–110 years) than in the middle (80–89 years) and in the younger (10–79 years) groups (P \ 0.05). The mt146T also had lower systolic blood pressure and serum markers such as

Introduction

Mitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for ATP synthesis, heat production, radical oxygen species (ROS) generation, fatty acid and steroid metabolism, cel- lular apoptosis, etc. Because of their critical role in energy production, mitochondria have been in the center of the studies on the mechanism for longevity [1]. Mitochondria have their own genetic material, mitochondrial DNA, a circular double-stranded molecule of 16,569 bp encoding two tRNAs, two rRNAs and 13 proteins [2]. Since mito- chondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited and since the female has a longer lifetime than the male in various species [3–7], mtDNA has been suggested to have an important role in the process of aging and longevity.

ent populations are expected to have different gene-lon- gevity associations. There is evidence for mitochondrial bioenergetics contributing to longevity [11–14], and the mitochondrial theory of aging suggests that a progressive accumulation of somatic mutations leads to a decline in mitochondrial function [15, 16]. Previous studies suggest that a variety of deletions and mutations accumulates with age in mtDNA [12, 17]. An association has been reported between certain mtDNA haplogroups and longevity [18]. For instance, the frequency of haplogroup J is significantly higher among male centenarians in northern Italy [19] whereas the haplogroup U is more frequent in centenarians than in younger people in the European [9, 20]. The 3010A, 5178A and 8414T of mtDNA occur at higher frequencies in Japanese centenarians comparing with other genotypes at these sites [21], while the mt9055A is reported to be more frequent in centenarians than in the younger popu- lation in French [22] and Irish [23].

Population and sample collection

Blood samples were collected from a total of 313 indi- viduals in the longevity and non-longevity areas in Guan- gxi Bama Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi Province of China. Of the 313 individuals, 113 were in the 90–110 years of age, 75 between 80 and 89 years of age, and the remaining 125 were between 10 and 79 years of age. Information on demographics, marriage, reproduction, work and living habits psychological and physical func- tioning status, and dietary habits was also collected by interviewing each individual. Age records were obtained from birth registers and generation rankings. The blood samples and personal data were collected in compliance with the institutional guidelines and under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Guangxi University. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants or from family representatives if the participants could not provide consent due to reasons such as illiteracy.

Bama Yao Autonomous County, in the Guangxi Zhu- ang Autonomous Region, Guangxi province of China, is one of the world’s well-known longevity regions. Recent demographic data show that the centenarian rate is 29.9/ 100,000 in Bama County, an intriguing 27 times higher than the rate in other parts of Guangxi province and 14 times higher than that the rate of 2.19/100,000 in China in a whole. This extremely high rate of centenarians makes ‘‘the Bama longevity’’ an intriguing research topic and has attracted the attention of many scientists. There are many natural, social, environmental and genetic factors which may account for the prolonged lifespan of the Guangxi Bama population. However, to date there have not been any studies on potential molecular mechanisms behind the Bama longevity. Our objective here, then, is to attempt to explore whether and how mtDNA point mutations are associated with the Bama longevity by determining the full mtDNA sequence and by analyzing the polymorphisms of the D-loop region of Guangxi Bama population.

Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 ll whole blood samples with Blood Genome DNA Extraction Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manu- facturers’ manual. The extracted DNA samples were stored at -20 (cid:3)C.

PCR primers were designed using the Oligo6.0 software to cover the entire mitochondrial genome with each pair of primers spanning 2–6 kb (Table 1). The PCR reaction was performed in 50 ll solution containing 5 ll 109 LA Buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl , 0.1 mM dNTPs, 0.4 lM primers, 2 1 lg genomic DNA, and 2U LA TaqTM DNA Polymerase (Takara Biotechnology (Dalian) CO., LTD, China).

PCR–RFLP

Fig. 1 Map of Guangxi Bama centenarian mitochondrial genome. The Guangxi Bama centenarian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a 16,569 bp circular molecule that codes for seven (ND1, 2, 3, 4L, 4, 5 and 6) of the 43 subunits of complex I, one (cytochrome b, cyt b) of the 11 subunits of complex III, three (COI, II, and III) of the 13 subunits of complex IV, and two (ATPase 6 and 8) of 16 subunits of complex V. It also codes for the small and large rRNAs, as well as 22 tRNAs with the adjacent letters indicating the cognate amino acids. PH, P and OH denote the heavy strand promoter, the light strand L promoter and the heavy strand replication, respectively

The mt5178A/C polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP). The primers used were designed according to Guangxi Bama mtDNA. The primer sequences were 50-CCCACA- TAGGATGAATAATAGCAG-30 and 50-TTACCACGC- TACTCCTACCTATCT-30, amplifying a 465 bp fragment. PCR reaction content contained about 1 lg of genomic DNA, 19 PCR buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl , 50 mM KCl), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 lM each pri- 2 mer, and 0.5U Taq DNA polymerase (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The PCR reaction conditions were the same as that for D-loop SNP described above. The PCR product was digested with the AluI restriction enzyme and then genotyped in 3.0 % agarose gel.

described in the Materials and Methods. All ten Bama centenarians’ full mtDNAs were deposited in the GenBank database and their accession numbers were listed in Table 3. The full mtDNA of Bama centenarian was a double-stranded circular DNA molecule of 16,569 bp, encoding a total of 37genes and its structure map is shown in Fig. 1. Of the 37 genes, 13 were for polypeptides, 22 for transfer RNA and two for the small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA. The full mtDNA sequence revealed four haplogroups, i.e. M*, F1, D* and D4, in the ten Bama centenarians (Table 3). Compared with Cambridge Refer- ence Sequence, we found seven novel variations in the ten Bama centenarians’ mtDNA. Of these seven nucleotide variations, four do not change amino acids, including two in the D-loop region, one in the RNR2 gene and one in the ND4 gene, while the remaining three variations lead to a replacement of amino acids, including 8860 A/G (Thr/Ala) in the ATP6 gene, the 14766 C/T (Thr/Ile), and 15326 A/G (Thr/Ala) in the CYB gene (Table 4).

Twenty-six variations were found in the 469 bp D-loop region of mtDNA from the 313 Bama individuals, of which only the variation at the mt146 was associated with longevity. The mt146T had a significantly lower frequency in the 90–110 years old group than that in the two younger (the 80–89 and 10–79 years old) groups (P \ 0.005) (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the mt146C occurred at a significantly higher frequency compared with the two younger groups (P \ 0.005) (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences for the mt146A genotype among three age-groups (P [ 0.005) (Fig. 2). The remaining 25 variations showed no significant difference among the three age-groups (P [ 0.05) (Table 5). The levels of systolic blood pressure as well as the total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein were significantly higher in those with the mt146C than in those with the mt146T genotype in the 90–110 years old group (P \ 0.05) (Fig. 3). Moreover, in the 90–110 years old cohort, the levels of triglyceride were much higher in those with the mt146C than in those with the

Statistical analyses

Alleles were evaluated for deviation from Hardy–Wein- berg equilibrium. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software version 8.02. The Pearson v2 test was used to analyze the genotype frequencies among the three age-groups. Serum parameters were analyzed using the least square means calculated from the general linear regression model (GLM) procedure.

The 5178A/C polymorphism of mtDNA

Analysis of the 5178A/C polymorphisms with PCR–RFLP approach did not identify any differences among the three age-groups (P [ 0.05). However, our study showed that the mt5178A/C polymorphisms were associated with national- ity. Yao nationality has a higher rate of the mt5178A geno- type (Fig. 4) but a lower rate of the mt5178C genotype (Fig. 5) compared with the Han and the Zhuang nationalities.

Discussion

Bama Yao Autonomous County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, i.e. Guangxi province, of China is well known for the longevity of its population, although the reasons for the Bama longevity are unclear. To date, there has not been any report on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study we have determined the full length sequence of mtDNAs of Bama centenarians for the first time and deposited them in the GenBank. We identi- fied many variations in the Bama centenarians’ mtDNA compared with the Cambridge Reference Sequence. Four of these variants included an amino acid change, mt8860A/ G, which locates in the mitochondrial ATP6 gene and which converts threonine to alanine. This polymorphism has previously been shown to severely reduce the rate of mitochondrial ATP production in yeasts and cultured human cells [24, 25]. Another polymorphism, mt11719

In the 5178C genotype, N = 31, 177 or 35 for the peoples in the Han, Zhuang, or Yao nationality, respectively. In the 5178A genotype, N = 3, 25 or 42 for Han, Zhuang, or Yao people, respectively

because it contains a great deal of genetic information for building up mitochondria. Moreover, the nucleus and the mitochondria interact in a variety of physiological functions that are crucial for cellular activity and survival. Mitochon- drial functions can be affected by mutations in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, by chemical insults to components of the electron transport chain, and by a lack of substrates such as oxygen for oxidation reaction in mitochondria. The reason for Guangxi Bama longevity remains veiled. The natural environment in Bama may also be part of the reason, but, meanwhile, meanwhile, our results give some evidence for a molecular mechanism of Bama longevity.

polymorphisms, i.e. the mt14766C/T and the mt15326A/G. These four polymorphisms have previously been hypoth- esized to contribute to the prolonged lifespan [15]. Sup- porting this hypothesis, there are some other studies showing an aging-dependent accumulation of oxidative and alkylation derivatives of nucleotides, of small deletions and insertions, and of large deletions in mtDNA [27, 28]. However, accumulation of aging-dependent point muta- tions has not been reported in human mtDNA [29], partly because of a lack of a reliable method for detecting het- eroplasmic point mutations and because the relevant research has been limited mainly to the protein- and RNA- coding regions of mtDNA.

located in a region termed ‘‘the main control region’’. This region is the most variable portion of the human mtDNA genome and is the location of the D-loop [30, 31]. Our results showed that there were many variations in this region in the Bama populations, of which the mt146C was strongly associated with the longevity. Moreover, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein as well as the systolic blood pressure were obviously higher in those with the mt146C genotype than those with the mt146T genotype in the older (90–110 years old) group. Previous study indicated that blood pressure and blood lipids had a biological interrelation and associated with age [32–34].The finding that the mt146C polymor- phism was associated with the Bama longevity was for its first time and was intriguing. It had been reported previ- ously that the mt150T was associated with longevity in four human populations, including Irish, Finnish, Japanese and Italian [8, 23, 35]. The mt150T genotype possibly prolongs the longevity as the mt150T genotype could confer a replication advantage to the mtDNA, thus accounting for the homoplasmic or nearly homoplasmic level mostly found in cells from centenarians. Moreover, the mt150T polymorphism could confer a resistance to oxidative stress and apoptosis [35]. Because the mt146 is located in the D-loop region and near to the mt150 of mtDNA control region, it is logical to speculate that mt146C has a similar function to that at the mt150T and contributes to prolonged lifespan in Guangxi Bama as well. While mt5178A has been shown to be associated with

Nevertheless, in our study, we found the mt5178C/ Apolymorphisms are strongly associated with nationality in the Guangxi Bama population, with a much higher rate of mt5178A and a much lower rate of mt5178C in the Yao compared with the Han and Zhuang nationalities.
