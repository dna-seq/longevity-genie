diseases, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and diabetes. Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) plays a crucial role in the gene network that modulates vitamin-D signaling. In this study, we evaluated the role of VDR gene variability in human longevity by selecting five polymorphisms of the VDR gene that capture variability at the 50, coding, and 30 regions. We obtained genotype data from 104 octogenarians ([85 years) and 114 controls (1740 years). Although differences in genotype and allele distribution did not reach statistical significance, haplotype distribution was distinctive, mainly for 30 region haplotypes and particularly in males. Our results suggest a role for VDR gene variability in aging and longevity.

Longevity is a multifactorial trait based on biological and non-biological factors. Recent socioeconomic improvements and advances in prevention and treatment of diseases have increased life expectancy in humans without affecting maximum lifespan potential. Vitamin-D deficiency is considered a risk factor for life-limiting illnesses such as cardiovascular and immune-related diseases and cancer. Vitamin-D acts through VDR, which regulates the expression of vitamin-D-response genes. VDR variants have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases.

Several VDR polymorphisms with functional effects have been described in the promoter, coding, and 30 untranslated region (UTR). Two common polymorphisms, Cdx (rs1568820) and A1012G (rs4516035), have been located in the regulatory region that affects binding to transcription factors. The rs1568820 polymorphism alters the site for the intestinal-specific transcription caudal-related homeodomain protein-2 (Cdx), affecting vitamin-D-VDR-mediated intestinal calcium absorption. The rs4516035 modifies the GATA-3 transcription factor recognition sequence, involved in the polarization of Th2 cells. In addition, a common FokI (rs10735810) polymorphism has been described in the VDR coding region that alters the first ATG start site to an alternate ACG giving rise to a VDR protein that is three amino acids shorter. Functional differences among rs10735810 show that the VDR protein coded by the allele (short 424 aas) interacted more efficiently with TFIIB and showed greater transcriptional activity than the full-length VDR protein coded by the allele. Finally, a common fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), as BsmI (rs1544410), and a microsatellite designated as PolyA (rs17878969), has been described in the 30-UTR region. Functional effects of 30-UTR have been related to alterations in VDR mRNA.

LD blocks range from 5 to 50 kb and are characterized by a reduced diversity of allelic combinations (haplotypes). Studies of the VDR genomic region in Caucasians have revealed a scattered LD pattern with rs1568820 and rs4516035 polymorphisms included in a single block of the VDR promoter and rs1544410 and rs17878969 polymorphisms included in a 30UTR block. Blocks are separated by a hotspot recombination region that includes the rs10735810 polymorphism. In this study, we obtained genotype information from five polymorphic variants located in the VDR gene at: 50 promoter region, rs11568820 and rs4516035; coding region, rs10735810; and 30UTR, rs1544410 and rs17878969.

In conclusion, VDR gene variability may play a role in aging and longevity. Vitamin-D deficiency is considered a risk factor for life-limiting illnesses, and VDR variants have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases. The study of LD patterns is essential for designing association studies of complex phenotypes.Diseases and immune system disturbances (Uitterlinden et al. 2004b) are factors that we propose make VDR a candidate gene involved in human longevity, due to its ability to protect against age-related diseases and modulate the immune response. We conducted an association study for longevity using the known haplotype block structure of the VDR genomic region, considering both single genotypes and haplotypes. 

Statistical analysis was performed by comparing genotype and allele distribution between controls and octogenarians using contingency table analysis via the OpenEpi web resource (Sullivan et al. 2009). Fisher exact test P values were considered for each comparison, and correction for multiple testing was done using the SNP spectral decomposition approach, which takes into account the linkage disequilibrium between markers (Nyholt 2004). The significance threshold required to maintain a Type I error rate of 5% was P = 0.036 for two-marker haplotypes and P = 0.011 for five-marker haplotypes. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium was measured by the normalized D0 coefficient (Lewontin 1988), which was estimated using Haploview 4.2 software (Barrett et al. 2005). Absolute D0 values range from 0 (no disequilibrium) to 1 (complete disequilibrium), indicating a nonrandom distribution of alleles with fewer observed haplotypes than expected.

Subjects included 214 Caucasian individuals from the city of Lleida in northeast Spain between January and June 2004: 104 octogenarians ([85 years), consisting of 72 women (mean age 89.4 ± 3.6; range 85-100) and 32 men (mean age 89.4 ± 3.2; range 85-97), and 110 sex-matched healthy young individuals, 75 women (mean age 28 ± 5.8; range 17-39) and 35 men (mean age 29 ± 8.6; range 17-40), were selected as cases and controls, respectively. A comprehensive medical history was obtained from each octogenarian, focusing on the absence of vitamin-D-related illnesses such as osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and cancer. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in accordance with Spanish laws, and the Ethics Committee for our institution approved the study.

We used PHASE 2.1.1 software (Stephens et al. 2001) to perform statistical inference of haplotypes from our sample data. Only data from fully genotyped subjects, which included 86 octogenarians (25 males) and 101 controls (35 males), were considered. We used the out_pair PHASE output file to assign haplotypes for each individual, with their corresponding probability. Haplotype counts were estimated by obtaining the cumulative probability of each haplotype. In brief, for an individual bearing haplotype A with probability 0.3 and haplotype B with probability 0.7, we added 0.3 and 0.7 to the corresponding counts of haplotypes A and B, respectively, estimating the presence of 0, 1 or 2 copies of a specific haplotype in each individual.

Genomic DNA from controls was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using a KG-Midi extraction kit (Camgen, Cambridge, UK). DNA from octogenarians was obtained from buccal swabs using the BuccalAmp DNA extraction kit (Epicentre). The gene structure of the VDR locus and linkage disequilibrium pattern of populations analyzed are shown in Figure 1.

The genotype and allele distribution conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all markers in both the control and octogenarian samples. We evaluated differences in genotype and allele distribution between octogenarians and controls, considering all subjects, gender between groups, and gender within each group (Table 1). No statistical differences were observed for single-marker genotype association modeled as dominant (common allele homozygotes and heterozygotes versus rare allele homozygotes), recessive (rare allele homozygotes versus common allele homozygotes and heterozygotes), and codominant (cross-genotype comparison). Allele distribution did not differ in any comparison performed (Table 1). The linkage disequilibrium pattern in the control sample was in accordance with available data for Caucasian populations (Fang et al. 2005), and block structure (D0 [0.8) was observed for markers rs11568820-rs4516035 (block-1, Figure 1b) and markers rs1544410-rs17878969 (block-2, Figure 1b).

Histogram plots of the 30UTR haplotype prevalence in all subjects (a) and in males (b). Bars indicate the 95% confidence interval of the proportion. Global distribution of haplotypes was compared by the PAC-likelihood test and was mainly due to males (0.07% in controls versus 9.5% in octogenarians, OR out of range; P = 0.014; Fig. 3b). The distribution of carriers of at least one copy of GGCGS haplotype (0.5% in controls and 8.3% in octogenarians, P = 0.023) is presented in Table 2. Males carrying at least one copy of GGCGS haplotype represent just 0.1% in controls but 18.9% in octogenarians (P = 0.012). Haplotype-specific tests revealed that rs1544410-G:rs17878969-S (GS) haplotype was overrepresented in octogenarians (7.3 versus 0.8%; odds ratio (OR): 15.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3-37; P < 0.001) (Fig. 2a). This difference was greater in males (14.2% in octogenarians versus 0.3% in controls, OR out of range, P = 0.006) (Fig. 2b). We also estimated the haplotype carrier status of each individual. The distribution of carriers of at least one copy of 30UTR GS haplotype is presented in Table 2. Carriers of at least one copy of GS haplotype were common in octogenarians (13.3%) but rare in controls (1.6%) (P = 0.008). Among males, nearly a quarter of the octogenarians carried at least one copy of GS haplotype, whereas GS carriers represent less than 1% of controls (24.4 versus The response caused vitamin D deficiency and toxicity, respectively. However, conferring middle VDR mRNA stability can be considered protective, as vitamin D response can remain in the homeostatic region, which is responsible for its genomic action. Several VDR gene polymorphic variants have been described to affect VDR gene expression (rs11568820 and rs4516035), protein structure (rs10735810), and mRNA stability (rs1544410 and rs17878969) (Fang et al. 2005; Uitterlinden et al. 2004a). Variability at the VDR locus has been associated with cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes (Uitterlinden et al. 2004b) as well as mycobacterium (Bellamy and Hill 1998) and viral infections (Fibla and Caruz 2010). Although the effect of VDR variability on aging has been well-studied, its role in aging and longevity has only been evaluated in relation to diseases; no data exist about its role in aging and longevity. In this case-control study, we compared allele, genotype, and haplotype distribution of five VDR gene variants between healthy-living octogenarians and younger controls to assess VDR as a candidate gene affecting aging and longevity. Our study is the first to provide evidence of an association between VDR gene polymorphisms and longevity, as reflected by the differential distribution of VDR haplotypes that we observed. The positive significant association between longevity and the 30UTR GS and five-marker GGCGS haplotypes was observed in octogenarian males but not in women. Epidemiological data on long-lived subjects document a clear-cut prevalence of females compared to males, suggesting that sex-specific mortality rates follow different trajectories. Demographic and behavioral risk factors have been considered in the literature, but do not account for the overall sex-related difference in mortality rates (Wingard 1984). In addition, the role of biological factors has been explored with contentious results (Austad 2006). Our finding of a sex-specific association was in accordance with previous reports that certain polymorphisms of the interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and interferon-gamma genes are male-specific markers for longevity (Bonafe et al. 2001; Di Bona et al. 2009; Giacconi et al. 2004; Lio et al. 2002a, b), supporting a finding that female longevity is less dependent on genetic background than male longevity (Franceschi et al. 2000).

To evaluate differences in VDR variants between young and elderly subjects, indirect data on genotype frequencies of VDR markers have been reported in the literature, but a comparison with our data is inappropriate due to differences in the origin of each population and in selection criteria. We acknowledge that our study has a number of potential limitations. Although octogenarian Caucasian cohorts may have common characteristics, such as the limited medical care available until the 1950s, we cannot exclude potential confounding factors. In particular, two historical events must be taken into account: the Spanish flu epidemic at the beginning of the twentieth century, which depleted the childhood population, and the Civil War (1936-1939) that had an especially important impact on male mortality (Gonzalez et al. 1996). The first event could have produced biological consequences, while the second had a stochastic effect. Another concern refers to the comparison of different birth cohorts, within which we assumed that initial frequencies are similar (Capri et al. 2008). We cannot exclude this confounding factor in our study. However, our cohorts fit Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all loci analyzed, and neither disturbances on random matting nor selective factors attributable to the study design were detected.

With respect to the biogerontological significance of the observed association, we can only suggest a correlation. The well-documented impact of vitamin-D levels on the aging process and on age-related diseases is bolstered by our results. In addition, the study results propose a new scenario in which the variability of the VDR gene is also relevant and emphasize the role of VDR genetic background in determining optimal vitamin-D levels for healthy aging.
