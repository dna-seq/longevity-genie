Abstract:

To explore the effects of mtDNA haplogroups on the prevalence of extreme longevity (EL), a population-based case-control study was conducted in Rugao - a prefecture city in Jiangsu, China. Case subjects include 463 individuals aged 95 years or older (EL group). Control subjects include 926 individuals aged 60-69 years (elderly group) and 463 individuals aged 40-49 years (middle-aged group) randomly recruited from Rugao. We observed a significant reduction of M9 haplogroups in longevity subjects (0.2%) when compared with both elderly subjects (2.2%) and middle-aged subjects (1.7%). Linear-by-linear association test revealed a significant decreasing trend of N9 frequency from middle-aged subjects (8.6%), elderly subjects (7.2%), and longevity subjects (4.8%) (p=0.018). In subsequent analysis stratified by gender, linear-by-linear association test revealed a significant increasing trend of D4 frequency from middle-aged subjects (15.8%), elderly subjects (16.4%), and longevity subjects (21.7%) in females (p=0.025). Conversely, a significant decreasing trend of B4a frequency was observed from middle-aged subjects (4.2%), elderly subjects (3.8%), and longevity subjects.

Conclusions:

Our observations support the association of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups with exceptional longevity in a Chinese population. These authors contributed equally to this work.

Introduction:

Mutations [10] have been linked to age-associated accumulations of mtDNA mutations [2,3]. In particular, haplogroup D4a, D5, and D4b2b were observed to be enriched in centenarians in Japan [11,12]. Haplogroup J was detected as overrepresented in male long-living subjects and centenarians in northern Italy [13], an observation that was replicated in Irish and Finnish populations [14,15], although contradicted in southern Italy [16]. These data suggest that the association between mtDNA variants and longevity could be highly geographically or population dependent, as seen from other genetic studies on longevity [17].

Individuals vary widely in their health status over their life course and in age at death. Longevity is thought to be a complex puzzle of interplay of environmental, behavioral, genetic, and stochastic factors. There is increasing evidence that exceptional longevity is a familial trait that is at least partially genetic. However, the magnitude of the genetic contribution is still controversial [13], and the inherited biological factors that promote longevity in humans remain undetermined.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a maternally inherited genome [4]. Human populations carry several mtDNA haplogroups defined by unique sets of mtDNA polymorphisms, reflecting mutations accumulated by a discrete maternal lineage [5,6]. Thus, haplogroup association studies have been used to assess the effect of mtDNA variants on various complex diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease [7-9]. Decades of evolution of the mitochondrial theory of aging have not yet clarified the possible contribution of mtDNA haplogroup-specific mutations to the prevalence of longevity. Therefore, we performed a population-based case-control study in a Chinese Han population residing in Rugao, Jiangsu Province. It is worth noting that Rugao has long been claimed as a longevity town in China since ancient times.

Materials and Methods:

We selected 33 mtSNPs to define 28 major mitochondrial haplogroups (D*, D4, D4a, D4b, D4b2, D4b2b, D5, M12,G*, G2, M7*, M7b, M8*, M8a, C, M9, M10, N9, N9a, A, F*, F1, B*, B5, B5a, B5b, B4a and B4b) found in the Chinese population as shown in Table 1 [20]. These SNPs allow allocating common mitochondrial East Asian haplotypes and following the suggestion of association of Histories and cognitive function appraisals were conducted, along with physical examinations. Fasting blood specimens were drawn for laboratory examination, including lipid, glucose, and liver function. To ensure quality control, all field staff involved in data collection and handling were trained. All interviews were recorded, and 5 percent of these interviews were evaluated for quality. Approximately 35 percent of subjects were re-contacted by phone to evaluate the interviewers' work. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or a member of their immediate family. The Human Ethics Committee of Fudan University School of Life Sciences approved the research.

Experimental procedures: Genomic DNA was extracted using a method described by Boom et al., with minor modifications [19]. In order to examine the correlations between haplogroups and longevity, we observed a decreasing trend of N9 haplogroups from middle-aged subjects (8.6%), elderly (7.1%), and EL subjects (5.3%) in female samples; however, the statistical significance originally observed in all subjects diminished, which may be due to a lack of statistical power (Table 3).

The PCR amplification was carried out using the following program: 95°C for 4 minutes - [94°C for 30 seconds - 60°C (-0.5°C/cycle) for 50 seconds - 72°C for 90 seconds] *11 cycles [94°C for 30 seconds - 55°C for 50 seconds - 72°C for 90 seconds]*24 cycles - 72°C for 10 minutes - 4°C. The final concentrations of each forward and reverse primer for mtDNA SNPs are as follows: For Multiplex 1, 12705 and 12811 are 0.33 mM; 12406 and 12358 are 0.35 mM; 7600 and 10400 are 0.53 mM; 8281 is 0.6 mM; 14569 is 0.67 mM; 9296 is 0.7 mM. For Multiplex 2, 4491, 8020, 8584, and 8684 are 0.2 mM; 5417 and 5465 are 0.25 mM; 1107 is 0.27 mM; 3010, 3970, 4833, 5178, 7196, 9824, 10646, 10873, and 15662 are 0.3 mM; 15235 is 0.37 mM; 3705, 8964, 13263, and 13590 are 0.4 mM; and 14979 is 0.47 mM; while1736 is 0.5 mM.

After the PCR amplification, the amplification products from both multiplexes were mixed and incubated with Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) (Promega, Madison, WI) for eighty minutes at37°C followed by fifteen minutes at75°C for enzyme inactivation. Then multiplex primer extension reactions were carried out by SNaPshot Multiplex Ready reaction mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), Sequencing Buffer5X (Applied Biosystems), and primers extension mix with the multiplex primer extension cycling conditions:96°C for one minute - [96°C for ten seconds -52°C for five seconds-60°C for thirty seconds] *28 cycles -4°C; the final concentrations of each extension primer are also given:1107,1736,3010,3705,3970,4491,4833,5178,7196,7600,8020,8584,8684,8964,9824,10646,10873,12811,13263,13590,15235, and 15662 are 0.16 mM; 5417 is 0.33 mM; 12406 is 0.37 mM; 5465, 12358, 12705, and 14979 are 0.41 mM; 14569 is 0.45 mM; and 8281, 9296, and 10400 are 0.49 mM. After the SNaPshot reaction, the excess ddNTPs were inactivated by treating the reaction with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega) for one unit followed by electrophoresis of final minisequencing products on the ABI3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Genemapper ver.4.0 software was used to analyze the data.

It has never been reported elsewhere that B4a is negatively correlated with ages in Rugao population. The correlation between mtDNA haplogroups and longevity is consistent with the hypothesis that mtDNA variations have a higher impact on male than on female longevity [37]. This gender difference could be one of the consequences of the maternal inheritance of mtDNA, which in turn implies a higher relaxation and less purging of male-specific mitochondrial phenotype, being males evolutionary dead ends for mtDNA. Interestingly, the haplogroup D4 was not enriched in male Rugao subjects, but only in female subjects. Coincidentally, longevity also shows maternal inheritance [38], and the female-to-male ratio is 3.5:1 in Rugao long-lived subjects. The fundamental mechanism of this phenomenon and the female correlation warrants further exploring.

The population was relatively homogeneous related to environmental exposures, which decreased the selection biases for case-control matching. Finally, although our study included 463 cases and two control groups, interpreting the results is also limited by the relatively insufficient sample size. For example, our sample size had the power of 0.91 and 0.65 to detect the differences between longevity subjects and elderly subjects, between longevity subjects and middle-aged subjects, respectively, given the significant level of 0.05.
