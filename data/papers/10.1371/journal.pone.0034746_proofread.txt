Abstract

Methodology/Principal Findings:
We identified individuals from a large multigenerational population database (the Utah Population Database) who exhibited high levels of both familial longevity and individual longevity. This selection identified 325 related affected individuals defined as those in the top quartile for both excess longevity (EL = observed lifespan - expected lifespan) and familial excess longevity (FEL = weighted average EL across all relatives). A whole-genome scan for genetic linkage was performed on this sample using a panel of 1100 microsatellite markers. A strongly suggestive peak (Z=4.2, Monte Carlo-adjusted p-value 0.09) was observed in the vicinity of D3S3547 on chromosome 3p24.1 at a point nearly identical to that reported recently by an independent team of researchers from Harvard Medical School (HMS) [1]. Meta-analysis of linkage scores on 3p from the two studies produced a minimum nominal p-value of 1.00561029 at 55 cM. Other potentially noteworthy peaks in our data occur on 18q23-24, 8q23, and 17q21. Meta-analysis results from combined UPDB and HMS data yielded additional support but not formal replication for linkage on 8q, 9q, and 17q.

Conclusions/Significance:
Corroboration of the linkage of exceptional longevity to 3p22-24 greatly strengthens the case that genes in this region affect variation in longevity and suggest therefore an important role in the regulation of human lifespan. Future efforts should include intensive study of the 3p22-24 region.

Introduction

Markers) in 2001 [13]. Later Boyden and Kunkel [1] produced an updated sib pair linkage analysis using an expanded dataset (632 subjects, consisting of some of the NECS subjects and additional subjects recruited more recently) along with a high-density panel of 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.

It has long been thought that related individuals share a familial predisposition to longevity, and for more than a century numerous studies have investigated the degree to which human longevity might be an inherited characteristic [21-2]. Most studies of this type have reported small (<10%) to moderate (<30%) heritability of human longevity amid differences in definitions of longevityResults. Additional and potentially more substantial biases can result from behavioral changes across generations and time. Larger and more robust genome-wide association studies (GWASs) will undoubtedly contribute importantly to our understanding of the genetics of longevity; but for now, other approaches, including family studies, remain competitive. The University of Utah Health Sciences Institutional Review Board and the University of Louisville Biomedical Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol; all recruited subjects provided their written consent to be included in this study. A total of 732 study subjects were genotyped by deCODE Genetics, Reykjavik, Iceland. Of these, 433 were identified as expressing an excess longevity phenotype (ELP) and were considered affected. We recruited and genotyped 139 offspring of affected individuals and considered these putative carriers of the ELP. Last, we recruited and genotyped 160 controls: 54 offspring of deceased siblings of affected individuals were considered putative non-carriers of the long-lived phenotype; and 106 randomly drawn individuals from the UPDB population complete the control group. Ages of the 433 ELP-affected individuals ranged from 86 to 109 years old. Only 325 of these were related to another genotyped affected individual. Subjects were enrolled between August 2003 and January 2009. By 2009, 117 ELP-affected subjects had died. The total number of affected pairs over all classes of relatives was 607 because many affected individuals were related to multiple others through multiple lines of descent. The complex and overlapping nature of the genealogical data makes delineation of discrete families difficult: by the broadest definition, all study subjects could be connected to one another by one or more known genealogical links (including marriage). On the other hand, the vast majority of affected pairs had kinship values of zero, i.e., they were not biologically related by any known common ancestry. In spite of the genealogical complexity, no converged to obviously incorrect solutions after consuming literally weeks of CPU time. (especially at advanced ages), and are less likely to have health care billing records in their own names than are men. All these characteristics make it more difficult to find a correct current residence using the available records. Therefore, we used a simplified version of the venerable affected member (APM) test, originally devised by Weeks and Lange, as a primary test for linkage of EL to each region. Let G and G represent the two alleles of i1 i2 given marker carried by person i; G and G are the j1 j2 alleles carried by a family member j of person i, q(g) is the allele frequency for marker allele g. Then the statistic S is: 

Genotypes. Genotyping was performed at deCODE Genetics, Reykjavik, Iceland, using the deCODE 1100 microsatellite marker set. Here we report only the autosomal marker results. Any marker successfully typed in at least 50% of subjects was analyzed. The maximum number of markers successfully typed in any sample was 1074, and 1051 markers (97.8%) met the analysis inclusion criterion (returned types for >50% of subjects). The number of alleles observed per marker ranged from 2 (D9S1152, DG19S135) to 38 (DG19S265). Average marker spacing over the 22 autosomes was 3.4 cM. Allele frequencies were estimated from control subjects by simple counting and checked against the HapMap European Reference (CEU) allele frequencies.

The relatively large and complex sample, in particular, the large number of ungenotyped individuals intervening in the paths of relationship between genotyped affected family members presented an analytical challenge. It proved impossible with existing software to obtain reliable estimates of identity by descent (IBD) probabilities. Exact estimation with software such as Genehunter, Allegro, or Merlin required more computer memory than was available; Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as employed by Loki, Genibd, SOLAR, and SIMWALK failed to converge or chromosome 3p24.1 @56.45 cM (or 30.1 Mb). D3S1266 and D3S3547 are immediately adjacent to one another on 3p24.1, as are D18S469 and D18S1161 on 18q22.3. Tables 2 and 3 also show p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons, as quantiles of the minimum simulated p-value observed at each locus. Alone, none of these results achieves genome-wide significance after adjusting for the number of hypotheses tested. The most significant genome-wide result is the single-point estimate for D3S3547 (adjusted p = 0.09). The same approximate location (@55 cM) yields a multipoint adjusted p of 0.20. The linked region on 18interest is TGFBR2, which has been associated with age-related diseases such as cancer and osteoporosis [41,42]. The identification of these genes in the linked region provides a starting point for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying exceptional longevity.

Overall, the FLAG study provides additional evidence for genetic linkage to regions on chromosomes 3p and 18q associated with exceptional longevity. The study also highlights the importance of careful definition of affected status when conducting genetic studies of complex traits. The limitations of the study, such as sample size and population diversity, suggest that further studies are needed to confirm and expand upon these findings. Nonetheless, the identification of genes in the linked region provides potential targets for future studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying exceptional longevity.Of particular interest in the 3p region is TGFBR2 because it is implicated in multiple disease etiologies [41,42]. However, of the 27 genes in the same region, most have functions that are not fully understood. Our definition of familial longevity (elevated FEL) assumes a dominant or additive model of inheritance. As a consequence, our selection criteria for affected individuals (and their familial relationship networks) are less sensitive for identifying potential recessive traits than dominant or additive traits. The familial recurrence pattern expected for a recessive trait (sib pairs scattered throughout a pedigree) would, in most cases, result in higher than expected FEL, particularly in the large sibships typical of the UPDB. Nevertheless, our study has substantially less power to identify loci with recessive effects on longevity: only 63 affected sib pairs are informative with respect to recessively inherited factors; while 607 pairs are potentially informative for dominant or additive inheritance. It is likely that variants at many loci contribute to the heritability of longevity in humans. Our independent replication of the 3p22-24 linkage peak originally reported by Boyden and Kunkel [1] should help focus the search for variants associated with longevity in this relatively small region. Advances in DNA sequencing make it practical to rapidly sequence the exons in the region, or the entire region, and hence identify the variant(s) responsible for the observed linkage signal. Other regions identified in one or both of these studies also deserve further scrutiny. We have recently described patterns of gene expression that are associated with human longevity and aging [43]. Now we can try to narrow the set of longevity-associated candidate variants at the 3p locus by searching for markers (microsatellites or SNPs) in the same 3p region that are associated with variation in gene expression patterns that are also associated with longevity. Although, in principle, this requires a complete set of GWAS data for each expression quantitative trait locus (or eQTL) of interest, several established data repositories for genome-wide eQTL studies [44,45] should greatly simplify the process.

The FLAG study differs from the HMS and other studies of exceptional longevity in several important respects. We ascertained subjects on the basis of both familial longevity and personal references.
