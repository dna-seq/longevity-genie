Abstract 

Background: A variety of definitions of successful aging have been proposed, many of which relate to longevity, freedom from disease and disability or preservation of high physical and cognitive function. Many behavioral, biomedical and psychological factors have been linked with these various measures of successful aging; however genetic predictors are less understood. Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder and variants in the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) affect susceptibility to PD. This exploratory study examined whether SNCA variants may also promote successful aging as defined by survival without neurological disease.

Methods: We utilized 769 controls without neurological disease (Mean age: 79 years; Range: 33-99 years) and examined the frequency of 20 different SNCA variants across age groups using logistic regression models. We also included 426 PD cases to assess the effect of these variants on PD risk.

Results: There was a significant decline in the proportion of carriers of the minor allele of rs10014396 as age increased (P = 0.021), from 30% in controls younger than 60 to 14% in controls 90 years of age or older. Findings were similar for rs3775439, where the proportion of carriers of the minor allele declined from 32% in controls less than 60 years old to 19% in those 90 or older (P = 0.025). A number of SNCA variants, not including rs10014396 or rs3775439, were significantly associated with susceptibility to PD.

Conclusions: In addition to its documented roles in PD and alpha-synucleinopathies, our results suggest that SNCA has a role in survival free of neurological disease. Acknowledging that our findings would not have withstood correction for multiple testing, validation in an independent series of aged neurologically normal controls is needed.

Introduction 

Aging can be defined as a progressive, generalized impairment of function resulting in a loss of adaptive response to stress and an increasing risk of age-associated disease [1,2]. Within this definition lies the paradoxical idea that individuals can age in a healthy manner, so-called successful aging, which is a topic that has received increased attention as a result of the dramatic increase in human life expectancy witnessed during the past century. While longevity is clearly a key part of aging in a healthy manner, it is equally clear that it is not the only component and that other factors require consideration [3]. The concept of successful aging was introduced by Rowe and Kahn, distinguishing usual aging from successful aging and referring to successful aging as freedom from disease and disability, preservation of high physical and cognitive function, and engagement in social and productive activities [4,5]. Many different attempts have been made to identify characteristics associated with the various measures of successful aging that have been proposed. The majority of these reports have investigated demographic, behavioral, biomedical or psychological factors and have identified predictors such as absence of arthritis, better activities of daily living and not smoking among many others [6,7]. However, fewer studies have examined genetic predictors. The identification of genetic factors related to specific aspects of successful aging has several potential benefits, for instance, shedding light on the underlying biological systems and processes involved in aging successfully and possibly allowing for the identification of people who possess harmful variants of those genes, for whom intervention could potentially increase the likelihood of successful aging.

Due to their links to specific aspects of successful aging such as disease, physical functioning and cognitive functioning, the study of age-related disorders offers promise in further understanding the mechanisms involved in the aging process. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disorders, with approximately 1.5% of the population older than sixty-five years being affected [8,9], and at the center of genetic PD research is the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA). Point mutations in SNCA were the first mutations identified in familial PD [10]. Subsequent studies showed alpha-synuclein to be the major protein component of the pathologic inclusion observed in PD, the Lewy body [11,12]. Identification of genomic multiplication of the SNCA gene in familial PD demonstrated that over-expressionParticipants in the study included controls and Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, seen at Mayo Clinic Florida. Unrelated controls were deemed free of neurological disease by a neurologist and had no family history of neurological disease. The mean age of the controls was 79±6.11 SD years (range: 33-99 years), and 385 (50%) were male. All controls were of European ancestry and white. Controls were mostly unrelated spouses/caregivers of neurological patients, and a subset of these controls was included in an aging sibpair study [20]. Using this group of controls, the association of SNCA SNPs with age was evaluated since the probability of living longer without neurological disease increases as age without neurological disease increases, and age in these controls is a measure of survival without neurological disease.

Results showed no evidence of a departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for any of the SNPs (all P>0.05). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs is summarized in Figure 1, showing moderate to strong LD between several SNCA SNPs, with many r2 values of 0.30 or greater. The proportion of carriers of the minor allele in controls is displayed in Table 1 for seven different age categories: <60 years, 60-69 years, 70-74 years, 75-79 years, 80-84 years, 85-89 years, and ≥90 years. These age categories were chosen to display trends while maximizing the number of controls in each category. As shown in Table 1, there was a significant decline in the proportion of carriers of the minor allele of rs10014396 as age increased (P=0.021). Results were similar for rs3775439, which was in strong LD with rs10014396 (r2 = 0.84); the proportion of carriers of the minor allele decreased from 32% in controls younger than 60 to 19% in those 90 or older (P=0.025). For the remaining SNCA SNPs, the proportion of carriers of the minor allele did not noticeably increase or decrease as age increased in controls (all P>0.19).

The healthy control series was supplemented with 426 PD cases seen at Mayo Clinic Florida to examine associations of SNCA SNPs with PD [21]. The mean age of PD cases was 72±6.11 SD years (range: 30-92 years), mean age at PD onset was 62±6.12 SD years (range: 26-85 years), and 233 (55%) were male. All PD cases were white and of European ancestry, examined and observed longitudinally by a neurologist, and diagnosed with PD according to published criteria [22]. There were no known related samples within or between the diagnosis groups. All subjects self-identified their ethnicity.

Table 2 presents single SNP associations with PD. Of particular interest, rs10014396 and rs3775439, both associated with survival without neurological disease in controls, were not associated with PD (ORs 0.92 & 0.95, P>0.58). Significant protective associations were observed for rs1372519 (OR: 0.76, P=0.034) and rs1372520 (OR: 0.76, P=0.039). For the remaining SNCA SNPs, a number of significant risk associations with PD were observed, including rs356218, rs2736990, rs2572324, rs2737033, rs2583959, rs2737012, rs2619361, rs2619362, rs2619363, and rs2583988 (ORs between 1.39 and 1.64, all P<0.026), all of which were in moderate to strong LD (Figure 1).

In this exploratory study involving more than 750 controls free of neurological disease, the findings suggest that SNCA may play a part in determining whether or not a given individual ages successfully as measured by the specific outcome of survival without neurological disease. For two SNCA SNPs, rs10014396 and rs3775439, the minor allele was less common in older controls. The lower proportion of carriers of the minor allele for these two SNPs in the older controls suggests that unobserved individuals who are carriers of these alleles experience death or neurological disease at an earlier age and are therefore removed from the pool of controls free of neurological disease at later ages, indicating that the presence of these alleles increases the risk of neurological disease or death. Although not of primary interest in this study, significant associations of SNCA SNPs with PD were observed in this study and previous studies [15-19,21]. Protective effects were observed for rs13752519 and rs1372520.

Odds ratios(ORs),95% confidence intervals(CIs) and p-values were obtained through logistic regression adjusted for age and gender and correspond to presence versus absence of the minor allele.

Neurological disease is relatively rare, and therefore the possibility of a Type II error (i.e. a false negative association), particularly after adjustment for multiple testing, is important to consider. Larger series of healthy controls, in particular healthy nonagenarians and centenarians, are needed in future evaluations of SNCA's role in the aging process. Finally, an important caveat of genetic aging studies is the possibility of population stratification given migration patterns and generational differences in lifestyle. Risk effects were noted for a number of other SNPs that were also in relatively high LD with each other. In addition to their known role in PD, SNCA variants have also been implicated in both diffuse Lewy body disease [30] and multiple system atrophy [31,32,33]. The associations between SNCA variants and survival without neurological disease observed in this study provide additional support for all of these findings and also further underscore the pleiotropic nature of SNCA.

Acknowledging these limitations, our results indicate that in addition to its known role in PD and a-synucleinopathies, SNCA may influence the likelihood of survival without neurological disease. Our findings require validation in an independent series, but suggest that further study of the role of SNCA variation in aging and cognitive function is warranted.

Several limitations are important to take into account when interpreting our results. There are likely other factors associated with survival free of neurological disease for which we did not collect information; as such, we cannot rule out the possibility that the associations between SNCA and survival free of neurological disease that we identified may be due in part to confounding factors. Also, owing to the exploratory nature of the study, we made no adjustment for multiple testing. The statistically significant decreasing frequencies of the minor allele for rs10014396 and rs3775439 as age increased in controls would not have remained significant after such an adjustment (P<0.0058 considered significant after permutation adjustment for multiple testing), highlighting the need for validation in independent series of healthy individuals. Our sample size of more than 700 controls free of neurological disease is relatively small, and therefore the possibility of Type II error (i.e. a false negative association), particularly after adjustment for multiple testing, is important to consider.
