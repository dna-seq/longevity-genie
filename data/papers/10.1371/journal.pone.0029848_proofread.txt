Abstract

Like most complex phenotypes,
exceptional longevity is thought to reflect a combined influence of environmental (e.g.,
lifestyle choices,
where we live) and genetic factors.
To explore the genetic contribution,
we undertook a genome-wide association study of exceptional longevity in 801 centenarians (median age at death 104 years) and 914 genetically matched healthy controls.
Using these data,
we built a genetic model that includes 281 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discriminated between cases and controls of the discovery set with 89% sensitivity and specificity,
and with 58% specificity and 60% sensitivity in an independent cohort of 341 controls and 253 genetically matched nonagenarians and centenarians (median age 100 years).
Consistent with the hypothesis that the genetic contribution is largest with the oldest ages,
the sensitivity of the model increased in the independent cohort with older and older ages (71% to classify subjects with an age at death >102 and 85% to classify subjects with an age at death >105).
For further validation,
we applied the model to an additional,
unmatched 60 centenarians (median age 107 years) resulting in 78% sensitivity,
and 2863 unmatched controls with 61% specificity.
The 281 SNPs include the SNP rs2075650 in TOMM40/APOE that reached irrefutable genome wide significance (posterior probability of association = 1) and replicated in the independent cohort.
Removal of this SNP from the model reduced the accuracy by only 1%.
Further in-silico analysis suggests that 90% of centenarians can be grouped into clusters characterized by different genetic signatures of varying predictive values for exceptional longevity.
The correlation between three signatures and three different life spans was replicated in the combined replication sets.
The different signatures may help dissect this complex phenotype into sub-phenotypes of exceptional longevity.

There are no patentsexceptional longevity.posterior probability of average longevity). The trend shows that including more SNPs increases both sensitivity and specificity, but the gain in accuracy becomes less significant as SNPs with decreasing statistical significance are added. The sensitivity plateaus between 275-285 SNPs, suggesting that including more SNPs does not improve sensitivity further. Therefore, the search for predictive SNPs stopped at 281. A resampling approach was also used to validate this choice, and the effect of changing the SNP order in the heuristic search and possible lab-genotyping bias were examined.

No changes were made to the original content or context of the text.dataset confirms that the genetic risk profiles of centenarians are more similar to each other than to the controls (Figure S11), indicating a common genetic basis for exceptional longevity. Our results also suggest that different combinations of longevity associated variants may contribute to exceptional longevity in different individuals, and that a subset of SNPs may be optimal for classifying some subjects but not others. Overall, our study provides further evidence that exceptional longevity is a complex trait determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and highlights the importance of studying the genetics of exceptional longevity to identify potential targets for interventions to extend healthy aging.profiles to predict exceptional longevity. The study identified 15 clusters with eight or more subjects, and approximately 35% of profiles clustered in groups of seven or less. Cluster analysis was used to group the genetic risk profiles into prototypical signatures, and it was investigated whether groups of centenarians with particular genetic risk profiles shared specific age-related sub-phenotypes. The specificity of the profiles in characterizing exceptional longevity was examined by generating genetic risk profiles of the control subjects in the discovery set and using cluster analysis to group them. 

Only five subjects had profiles that predicted exceptional longevity with more than 90% posterior probability, and other clusters with more than eight subjects showed that the majority of these profiles match either the lack of a predictive (predictive) or cluster C26 (the least predictive). Cluster analysis identified 26 groups of eight to 94 centenarians (90% of the discovery set) with similar genetic risk profiles, while 10% of the centenarians had rare profiles that occur in groups of seven centenarians or less. 

The prototypical genetic risk profiles associated with each cluster are informative displays of the longevity associated variants and represent different genetic signatures of exceptional longevity. While the ensemble of genetic risk models provides a global estimate of the probability of exceptional longevity, the pattern longevity associated variants of clusters C24C25 in Figure S11. The most predictive genetic signatures that characterize exceptional longevity are rare amongst control subjects, and only 0.6% of the genetic signatures of control subjects have a posterior probability of exceptional longevity .0.95. 

The study observed a similar result when comparing the survival of centenarians with the most predictive signatures in the merged replication sets (R1 and R2), and when comparing the survival of centenarians with the most and least predictive signatures (R1 and R15). However, not all signatures correlated with different survival, for example, centenarians with signatures C1 and C3 did not demonstrate different survival. Preliminary analyses provided in the supplementary material suggest that the different genetic signatures of exceptional longevity associate with varying prevalences and ages of onset of various age-related diseases. 

Interestingly, the patterns of genetic risk profiles that cluster into genetic signatures distinctly differ from clusters of genetic risk profiles generated from SNPs selected at random. It was also investigated if some clusters were enriched for specific ethnicities, but no clusters showed enrichment for any specific European ethnicity. The study investigated whether different genetic signatures correlate with different life spans, and some genetic signatures were indeed associated with significantly different life spans. 

For 17 of the 28 centenarians in cluster C26 who lack almost all the longevity associated variants discovered in this study, information about familial longevity was available. Twenty-five percent (n=5) had more than 50% of siblings who survived past the age of 90 and some had evidence for longevity as shown in some pedigrees in Figure S18. This could indicate that such families have more private or rare variants not captured by either the genotyping or the model.

In conclusion, though living to very old age runs strongly in families, it is a complex phenomenon with many different patterns of survival that include disease-free survival but also survival with various age-related diseases. The study developed an approach that uses genetic risk profiles to predict exceptional longevity, and the results obtained were informative and can be used as a basis for further research.in combination, rather than the absence of disease-associated variants. Our study has some limitations, including the use of heuristic rules in our genetic risk modeling approach, and the fact that our sample only includes Caucasian subjects, which limits the generalizability of our findings to other racial groups. However, our analysis provides novel insights into the genetics of exceptional longevity, including the identification of 130 genes implicated in this complex phenotype and the correlation of different genetic signatures with different patterns of survival. We hope that our approach may prove useful in dissecting other complex genetic traits and that future studies will replicate and expand upon our findings.In our analysis, we found specific genetic signatures that counteract the effects of disease-risk alleles and contribute to compressing morbidity and disability towards the end of very long lives [43]. We also observed that certain signatures correlated with the prevalence and age of onset of some age-related diseases, and more research is needed to understand how and why they predispose for exceptional longevity and different patterns of aging. These genetic signatures were created using an ensemble of genetic risk models, which showed high sensitivity in predicting exceptional longevity even without knowledge of other risk factors. This high sensitivity aligns with theoretical results indicating high predictability of rare and highly heritable traits, even when only 50% of the genetic variants that determine the trait are found [36], and with the accuracy of genetic risk models developed to predict complex and highly heritable traits [37-41].

To quantify the amount of genetic variance in liability to exceptional longevity explained by our model, we used an online calculator (http://gump.qimr.edu.au/genroc/) to translate the predictive accuracy measured by the AUC into a proportion of explained genetic variance on the liability scale [36]. Based on previous reports and the latest US 2010 Census (http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf), we estimated that exceptional longevity (living to 100+) has a prevalence of 1 in every 5,000 people, while the sibling relative risk for exceptional longevity ranges between 8 and 17 [9,10]. Using these numbers, we estimated that a maximum AUC for a genetic model of exceptional longevity ranges between 0.95 to 0.98. Our genetic model reached an AUC of 0.74 in the second replication set (Figure S7), explaining between 12% to 17% of the genetic variance on the liability scale. In the ELIXIR replication set, the AUC of our genetic risk model is 0.58, which would represent 12% of explained genetic variance. Since the ELIXIR set includes more nonagenarians than centenarians, and their prevalence in the population is 0.5% with a sibling relative risk of approximately 2.5, we repeated the calculations in this scenario. The 0.58 AUC translated into approximately 4% of the genetic variance on the liability scale. These results indicate that although we explained a good amount of genetic variability on the liability scale for living to very old ages, there is still more than 80% missing heritability that needs to be explained through more comprehensive genetic studies.

The NECS began in 1994 as a population-based study of all centenarians living within eight towns in the Boston area [81]. Since 2000, the NECS has expanded enrollment to include centenarians from throughout the USA (www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian). Potential subjects are ascertained via voting records and media alerts. Subjects are sent a demographic data, lifestyle choices, medical history and functional status questionnaire, family pedigree form, and blood kit. A dementia scale test is administered over the telephone. The study is still actively recruiting centenarians with an average of 50 subjects enrolled per year. The NECS controls consist of approximately 450 referent subjects comprised of spouses of centenarian offspring and children of parents who died at the mean age of 73 years with an age at enrollment ranging between 53 and 90 years.

The specificity of our classification rule is 60-61% in the independent sets and is comparable to other genetic studies of complex traits [76-78]. Although better than random, this specificity would not be useful as a diagnostic test. The decreased specificity in this study could be due to the fact that control subjects from the Illumina database are primarily healthy controls used for other genome-wide association studies, and therefore the control data set may be enriched for healthy aging subjects. We identified 3,613 Caucasian healthy controls from the Illumina control database (iControlDB, http://www.illumina.com/downloads/PurposeDocument.pdf). No phenotypic information is available for subjects selected from the Illumina repository except for gender (<60% females) and age at blood draw for some subjects (age range 0-75 years). The Coriell NINDS control sample in the Parkinson's disease (PD) set is described elsewhere [21]. Subjects from these studies were combined to generate a discovery and replication set using genetic matching (see below) and an additional replication set in which subjects were not genetically matched.

Our finding that about 17% of Illumina controls have signatures with a >70% chance of exceptional longevity (Figure S14) suggests that a substantial proportion of this group has a genetic predisposition to exceptional longevity. If this observation is replicated in more representative samples of the population, it could partly explain why centenarians are the fastest-growing age370 samples were analyzed together, including 102 from the NECS study, 176 from centenarians, and 92 from the ELIXIR study. The samples underwent sample-based QC checks, and sample call rates (CR) were computed using QC statistics. Samples with CR below 96.5% were eliminated, and re-clustering was performed. The excluded samples with CR above 93% were included using the new cluster file. The allele coding in other arrays was tested for agreement by comparing allele frequencies, which ruled out general bias between arrays and removed SNPs with reversed alleles. An additional sample of 60 centenarians included 39 subjects genotyped in September 2010 using the 610-Quad array. A principal components analysis was run on the NECS and Illumina SNP data to control for population stratification, and clustering was used to group individuals with similar ancestry into the same cluster. The Bayes Factor (BF) was used to score each SNP association by computing the posterior odds for association between the SNP and phenotype. The genomic control factor was estimated to determine the expected number of false positive associations of the decision rule that selects a significant association when the BF of at least one of the four models is greater than the threshold. For genotype association, two ORs for exceptional longevity (EL) were estimated based on gender effect. Significant SNPs in the discovery set were tested for modification of association due to gender effect.text does not affect the meaning. Therefore, no correction is needed for this part of the text.

When a gender-SNP interaction model was used, we used the retrospective likelihood to test whether the distribution of each selected SNP is independent of the phenotype once we condition on gender. Accepting the null hypothesis implies that the association between SNPs and phenotype is explained away by gender, and none of the associations could be explained away by gender. 

The probability of association ranges from 10 for multiple dependencies to 100 for two-way SNPxSNP interaction. The methodology based on Bayesian networks is described in detail in [62,90]. 

We estimated the conditional probabilities of genotypes as shown in Table 6 (Notation of allele frequencies in the allelic model) and Table 4 (Notation of genotype frequencies). 

For each SNP set, S, the Bayesian classification rule calculates k the posterior probability of EL as: 

p(ELjS)~i~1 i k p(EL)Pk p(SNPjEL)zp(AL)Pk p(SNPjAL)i~1 i i~1 i 

The rule is to classify a subject as predisposed to exceptional longevity if p(ELjS)wp(ALjS). 

We found 1214 SNPs in the Illumina array that we used for the GWAS of EL with acceptable quality. We calculated the number of disease alleles carried by centenarians versus all Caucasian controls included in our analysis. 

We choose K = 500 that corresponds to testing SNPs with approximately a posterior probability of an association .0.95 and removed from this set 100 SNPs that are highly correlated. To this end, we built a Bayesian network to capture mutual dependencies between SNPs that represent either strong linkage disequilibrium or strong SNP-SNP associations and removed those SNPs that are conditionally independent of the phenotype given more significant SNPs. We used a threshold on the posterior. 

We estimated the conditional probabilities p(SNPjphenotype) i using conjugate Bayesian analysis as described earlier. 

To validate the genotyping of the SNPs included in the model, 30 SNPs (.10% of the SNPs in the model) were selected to re-genotype using the TaqMan platform (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). This genotyping was performed at Yale University. The samples included 688 centenarians and 221 controls from the NECS that were included in the discovery set and for whom we had available DNA. 

This can be written as 

p(SNP p(EL)Pk i~1 p(SNPijEL)zp(AL)Pk i~1 p(SNP p(SNPkz1jEL)|p(EL)Pk i~1 p(SNPijEL)zp(SNPkz1jAL)p(AL)Pk i~1 p(SNPijAL) 

Note that this property is independent of the SNPs in the current SNP set, so changing the order of the text does not affect the meaning. Therefore, no correction is needed for this part of the text.Nested models may change the overall pattern of the risk profile, but not the interpretation in terms of enrichment of longevity-associated variants. The ensemble of genetic risk models uses 281 nested SNP sets to compute the risk for EL and AL (average longevity), and the overall risk is estimated as the average of all genetic risks. There were 34 duplicate samples genotyped using TaqMan across the 28 SNPs, generating a total of 952 duplicate genotypes, 950 of which had both samples called. Of these 950 duplicate genotypes, 100% were concordant. For the 28 SNPs successfully genotyped, we observed between 1 and 10 discordant genotypes per SNP between the TaqMan genotype and the microarray genotype, yielding concordance rates between 98.88% and 99.89% between genotyping platforms. Our overall discordance rate across all SNPs was <1%, and accuracy was 85%. Panel B displays the specificity for the two types of controls in the discovery set (NECS referent subjects: continuous line; Illumina controls: dashed lines) and shows that there is no difference between the two control sets. Panel C describes the effect of reordering the 281 SNPs. Patterns of sensitivity and specificity using the discovery set (left) and randomly generated validation sets (right) when the top 281 SNPs were randomly entered into the nested models (continuous lines: SNPs are ordered by MBF; dashed lines: the same 281 SNPs are randomly arranged). Panel D describes the effect of random selection on sensitivity and specificity of the nested models. Patterns of sensitivity and specificity using the discovery set (left) and randomly generated validation sets (right) when 281 SNPs were randomly chosen from the top 1,700 most significant SNPs (continuous lines: SNPs are ordered by MBF; dashed lines: 281 SNPs are randomly selected from the 1,700 most significant). The analysis shows that changing the order affects sensitivity and specificity of the model. Furthermore, selecting SNPs at random from the top most significant SNPs gives models that are consistently less specific and less sensitive. This low rate of discordant genotypes did not affect the results: 23 of the 28 SNPs reached statistical significance in the replicated data, and although 5 SNPs did not reach statistical significance, possibly because of the small sample of controls, the allele frequencies from the microarray data and TaqMan data are virtually indistinguishable (Figure S5), suggesting that a 1% genotyping error rate should have no impact on this analysis. Supporting Information S1 Population structure of centenarians and controls. Scatter plot of principal components 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2, top panels), and principal components 3 and 4 (PC3 and PC4, bottom panels) in subjects from the NECS (left) and Illumina database (right) that were estimated using genome-wide data. We labeled the clusters by ethnicity using the information about mother tongue and place of birth of NECS subjects and their parents. Note that some of the European ethnic groups in controls (NECS and Illumina) are not represented in NECS cases, for example Italics (fl green), SaxNon/Scandinavia (green), Celtics/Alpine (& red), and Franks (N, red). Figure S5 Correlation between allele frequencies estimated with the TaqMan assay and the arrays. The top panel shows the agreement between the allele frequencies estimated with the TaqMan assay in 688 centenarians (x-axis) and 801 centenarians of the discovery set (y-axis). The bottom panel shows the agreement between the allele frequencies estimated with the TaqMan assay in 221 controls of the NECS included in the discovery set (x-axis) and all 914 controls of the discovery set (y-axis). The difference between allele frequencies in the two groups was at most 0.04 (rs6801173). This particular SNP has substantial variability with ethnicity. Figure S2 Error rate in log10 scale of the Bayes rule for different thresholds of the MBF. The x-axis reports the estimate of the 2log10(error rate) and 95% credible intervals that were estimated using a Beta distribution in 1,000,000 simulations per threshold on the MBF (y-axis). The MBF is the maximum Bayes Factor computed to test the association of each SNP in 4 genetic models (genotypic, allelic, dominant, recessive). The genotype data were generated with allele frequencies varying uniformly between 0.05 and 0.5 and assuming HWE. The analysis suggests that a MBF >1,400 determines an error rate of approximately 1 to 2 errors per 100,000 tested associations (2log10(2/100,000) =4.7Cluster analysis was performed on genetic risk profiles and derived signatures. From the analyzed SNPs, 300 were randomly selected, and a set of nested genetic risk models were generated using the procedure described in the manuscript. This analysis was repeated multiple times, consistently showing sensitivity and specificity in the replication set to be 0.5 (pure chance). The attempt to cluster the genetic risk profiles produced many smaller clusters (average size of 3 profiles per cluster compared to 15 profiles per cluster in the signatures generated in the manuscript), many profiles that could not be clustered at all, and those profiles that could be clustered more effectively were showing random variability around 0.5. Figure S11 shows 26 genetic signatures clustered using CAGED and hierarchical clustering, ordered by the average genetic risk. The boxplots display the ages at death between the 25th and 75th percentile, with median age depicted as the middle bar. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box. The boxplots are ordered by predictive accuracy of the genetic risk models within clusters. Only clusters with 8 or more centenarians are included. Several of the signatures discovered in the replication set match signatures in the discovery set: The pattern of R1 matches C1, R2 matches C2, R4.

Table S1 is a list of 281 SNPs included in the genetic risk model. This is an excel file with 3 worksheets: README worksheet describes the column contents; 281 SNPs worksheet describes the list of 281 SNPs used in the ensemble genetic risk models including details about call rate by array type and phenotype, details of QC, statistical analysis. Functional annotation worksheet includes functional annotation of the 281 SNPs.

Figure S19 reports on the posterior probability of exceptional and average longevity for different genotypes of rs2075650. The ROC analysis shows that this SNP alone cannot optimize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The area under the curve is 0.62 compared to 0.95 when 281 SNPs are used in the model (Figure S7, top, left panel). Note that some threshold on the posterior probability can produce an accuracy that is worse than random classification.

Table S3 lists the rate of disease-associated variants carried by centenarians and controls, and p-value from Students T test. Risk alleles were derived from the GWAS catalogue at the NHGRI (downloaded in April 2011) and the Human Genome Mutation Database. The boxplots display the rate of risk alleles carried by centenarians (blue) and controls (red). The diseases described are: lupus, cholesterol level (Chol), macular degeneration (MD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Chrons disease (chr), diabetes (diab), cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer (canc)r, Alzheimer's (AD), GWAS.pt is the group of alleles related to personality disorders that were found in GWAS, gwas.qt is the group of alleles related to QTL from GWASs and includes cholesterol, BMI, obesity, etc., and GWAS.cc is the group of risk alleles found from case/control GWASs so includes for example cancer, PD, MD etc., cod is for coding variants from the HGMD, and all is the full set of 1214 variants.

Table S4 lists disease-associated SNPs that showed significant differences in the discovery sets. Highlighted in grey are the SNPs with risk alleles that are less common in centenarians. Some SNPs had unreported risk alleles in the original publications denoted with a question mark.

The two pedigrees show examples of familial longevity although the genetic risk profiles of the two centenarian probands (red arrows) show no enrichment of longevity-associated variants. This could indicate that such families have more private or rare variants not captured by either the genotyping or the model. Figure S21 shows the agreement of allele frequencies in different centenarians genotyped with array HumanHap370 (x-axis) and 168 centenarians genotyped with the HumanHap 1 M (y-axis). Panel B shows the allele frequency in 151 controls typed with array HumanHap330 (x-axis) and 863 with HumanHap 550 (y-axis). Panel C shows the allele frequency in 241 controls typed with array HumanHap370 (x-axis) and 863 with Human- Hap 550 (y-axis).
