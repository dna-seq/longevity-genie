ground allowing selection equilibriuTm to be established. These two assumptions, however, are not mSet when it comes to multifactorial diseases relevant to the ageing Ipopulation in modern affluent and fast D developing societies. Therefore, a priori it is quite possible that SNPs could be causative andT thus associated with multifactorial diseases, and even lifespan. the relative effect-size in most cases is probably small and in the order of 10–100% change of relative risk.

More than ten million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in humans; however, the importance of most SNPs for health and disease is not understood. Most SNPs are indeed unimportant and because of often inadequately powered studies, many observations on SNP effects can not be repeated by other researchers. SNPs are at best shown to influence protein function or level, rarely to influence risk of disease, and almost never to influence total mortality, the ultimate endpoint. A well- known functional SNP in the tumor suppressor TP53 gene leads to increased longevity: in the Danish general population (n = 9219) homozygotes for the minor allele versus homozygotes for the major allele had an increase in median survival of 3 years. This is partly explained by increased survival after development of cancer or other diseases, in accordance with the observation that Arg72Pro substitution in the p53 protein has important influEence on cell death via increased apoptosis. Thus, the increased loIngevity C may be due to a generally increased robustness after a diagnosis of S any life-threatening disease. In contrast to widespread skepticism O on the importance of SNPs in humans, this gain-of-function p53 SNP of importance for cell repair has a profound influence on longevity.

O Admittedly, the history of genetic association with common multifacDtorial diseases is full of irreproducible studies with a repro- duci bility ratio of 16%, probably due to inflated estimates in small . uEnder-powered case-studies, inadequate selection of controls, and bias favouring positive associations.4 These failures in the past imply that studies on genetic variations and their associa- tion with multifactorial diseases must be very large if the results are to be trusted, and they must include the relevant population suited to answer the questions asked with as little bias as possible. To meet these demands, large prospective studies of the general population is the gold-standard: in his proposal for a prospective study in the US, Francis Collins states that “…(genetic) associations and esti- mation of their magnitude, consistency and temporality (all key criteria for epidemiological evidence of causal relationships) are best obtained through prospective, population-based cohort studies”5 and that “…prospective cohort studies provide a valuable, feasible and, indeed, indispensable means of exploring the genetic basis of complex human diseases”.6 In Denmark such a prospective study, The Copenhagen City Heart Study, was already established in the

Introduction

After completion of the human genome project, more than ten N million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identi- A fied;1-3 however, the importance of most SNPs for health and disease L is not understood. By definition, SNPs are genetic variations with an allele frequency abo8ve 1% in a given population. This definition 0 seemingly precludes that SNPs could have severe consequences for 0 survival of the individual; if carrying a given SNP was that disadvan- 2 tageous, it would soon disappear due to Darwinian selection. This argument has at least two implicit assumptions: (1) The SNP reduces fitness at an early still fertile age; (2) A constant environmental back-

The Copenhagen City Heart Study

In this study, participants aged 20 to 95 years were recruited at random from the Danish general population in Copenhagen.7,8 Participants have been interviewed and examined at three occasions in 1976–78, 1981–83 and 1991–94, supplementing the cohort with new participants at the second and third occasion. At each examina- tion, participants were interviewed and examined, and in 1991–94 DNA was isolated from >9000 participants.

The advantages of The Copenhagen City Heart Study thus are its size, the random selection of participants from the general population, the long follow-up, the thorough phenotyping and the completeness of the national Danish health registries. The homog- enous Danish population precludes the need for ethnic stratification, and makes The Copenhagen City Heart Study more powerful for genetic studies than most cohorts from admixed populations. These characteristics make The Copenhagen City Heart Study a unique resource for studying effects of genetic variations.

The frequency ofR the Pro72 allele of Arg72Pro ranges from 70% among South ATfricans to 23% among Western Europeans (Fig. 2).22 Pro72 is pS robably the ancient allele, but the I reason for the high frequency of Arg72 among Europeans is unclear.

p53 [OMIM # 191170] is a tumor suppressor and its 19 kb gene (TP53) is situated on chromosome 17p13.1. It consists of 11 exons resulting in a transcript of 2,629 bp and a protein of 393 amino acids. In half of all human cancers, the tumor suppressor p53 is damaged by somatic mutation in tumor cells.9 This protein is at the centre of cell regulatory pathways, influencing transcription and activity of several replication and transcription factors, and is known as the guardian of the genome. In case of UV-radiation, proto- oncogene activation or DNA damage, p53 is activated. p53 acts through several pathways when reacting to cellular stress. Apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at the G checkpoint, and cellular senescence are all 1 mechanisms triggered by activated p53,10 thereby preventing cancer growth. When p53 is damaged, cancer cells continue to multiply. In agreement with this, transgenic mice overexpressing p53 are virtually immune to the development of tumors.11

Due to th e central role of p53 in the development of cancer, and O the demonstrated functional differences between the Arg72 and D the Pro72 allele, it has been hypothesized that this polymorphism is as sociated with risk of cancer. Using mainly case-control studies, . alEmost all neoplastic disease subtypes have been associated with the Arg72Pro polymorphism, but with conflicting results.22,24,27 Much research has concentrated on the risk of cervical cancer, but a recent meta-analysis concluded that the aggregated change of risk across the three genotypes was “essentially null”.22 Risk of breast cancer has also been examined in several studies with conflicting results, but the largest case-control study comprising 8743 cases and 10,618 controls produced risk estimates for both Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes of 1.0 (95 % confidence interval, 0.9–1.1) vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes.39

Despite these beneficial effects of increased p53 activity for cancer resistance, mice overexpressing p53 age prematurely and E even die earlier than their wild-type counterparts.11 Thus, activa- I tion of p53 is beneficial when the organism is young, butC in older organisms it might reduce lifespan and even augment cSancer risk,12 so-called antagonistic pleiotropy.10,13 In accordaOnce with this concept, p53 accelerates aging when responding Ito cellular stress.14 B In cell cultures, inactivation of normal p53 activity in senescent cells completely reverses the senescent h arrest, and allows the cells to resume cell divisions for many despite critically shortened telomeres.15

Arg72Pro and Morbidity

Germline truncating mutationNs of TP53, the gene coding for p53, are associated with a rar Ae autosomal dominant disorder, the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.16 T Lhis syndrome is chacterized by multiple primary neoplasms in ch ildren and young adults, with a predomi- nance of soft-tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, breast cancer, brain

Participants (n = 9,219) of The Copenhagen City Heart Study were genotyped for the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism8 using the Nanogen system.40 Taking advantage of the 100% complete follow- up, we were able to examine association between the Arg72Pro genotype and risk of any cancer8 (Fig. 3). For Arg/Pro heterozy- gotes versus Arg/Arg homozygotes we found a borderline increased gender and age adjusted hazard ratio for all cancer of 1.1 (95% CI: 1.0–1.2), but since the equivalent hazard ratio for Pro/Pro homozy- gotes was nominally decreased at 0.9 (0.8–1.1), we considered this as a chance-finding.

Several germline SNPs in TP53 have been most of 2 them located in introns and of uncertain significance. The SNP rs1042522 is, however, located in exon 4 and results in an Arginine to Proline amino acid substitution in position 72 of the p53 protein.

In 6 subtypes of cancer (gastrointestinal, respiratory, urologic, female, male and other types) including risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (both in the “other” category), we gener- ally did not find any association with Arg72Pro genotype (Fig. 3); surprisingly however, the risk of hematologic cancer increased 2-fold in Arg/Pro heterozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes (p < 0.001), with a similar trend in Pro/Pro homozygotes. This 2-fold increased risk was

significant even after correction for multiple testing, and therefore might represent a real phenomenon rather than a chance finding; however, this needs to be confirmed in another independent study.

We next sought to validate earlier findings suggesting association of Arg72Pro with risk of a variety of other diseases.20-27 However, in our study Arg72Pro genotype was not associated with risk of cardiovascular or other diseases (Fig. 4, left).8

Arg72Pro and Mortality

. Having examined Arg72Pro genotype and E morbidity, we next examined morTtality.8 The overall 12-year survival after blood saUmpling was increased in Arg/Pro heterozygotes wBith 3% (p = 0.003) and in Pro/Pro homozygoteIs with 6% (p = 0.002) vs. R Arg/Arg homozygotes (Fig. 5, left). This corre- T sponds to a sex and age adjusted hazard ratio for S death from any cause in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and I Pro/Pro hoDmozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81–0.96) and 0.82 (0.68–0.97), T respectively (Fig. 4, right). This reduction in risk of O death translates into an increased median survival of N 2 years and 3 years for Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes (Fig. 5, right). In accordance with this, the frequency of Pro allele appeared to increase with increasing age age 90 years, when the mortality of the partici- begins to rise (Fig. 6). The Leiden 85-plus study found increased survival in Pro/Pro homozygotes Arg/Arg homozygotes among 1226 partici- 85 years or older followed for 5–10 years.26

As already shown, the stepwise increased longevity in p53 Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozy- gotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes was not explained by decreased risk of developing cancer, cardiovascular disease or other life-threatening diseases (Fig. 4, right). More likely, it was explained by a better prognosis in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes after the diagnosis of cancer or other life-threatening disease: the cumulative 5- year mortality after a cancer diagnosis was reduced in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes by 9% (p = 0.003) and 13% (p = 0.03) (Fig. 7). The reduced 5-year mortality corresponds to a decreased age and sex adjusted hazard ratio for death after a diagnosis of cancer of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.77–0.98) in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and of 0.74 (0.56–0.98) in Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes (Fig. 4, right). Thus, mortality after a cancer diagnosis was stepwise reduced with increasing number of Pro72 alleles (trend-test, p = 0.005). Also for other diseases including diabetes, lung diseases and infections, mortality was reduced by 10% by each number of Pro72 alleles (trend-test, p = 0.002) (Fig. 4, right). Similarly, the risk of death after a cardiovascular diagnosis was nominally but

We demonstrate that the p53 Arg72Pro SNP alone may prolong life on average 3 years, roughly equivalent to a quarter of the effect between smokers and non-smokers.8 Importantly, as smoking status is the strongest known common life-style predictor of death in the general population, o.ur study illus- E trates that the observed effect of T this p53 SNP is a very large one indeed.

For all analyses described above, multifactorial adjustment for other potential confounders (cumulative tobacco consumption, smoking status, body mass index, alcohol consumption, plasma cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and physical inactivity) gave similar risk estimates (data not shown).

insight is limited. Inferring impact on human health from knowledge of genetic variation to change of protein function further to influ- . E ences on the cellular level and finally to affect the entire person can be extremely difficult: the DNA G251C substitution in the TP53 gene causing the Arg72Pro substitution of p53 leads to decreased binding to p7328 and decreased location to mitochondria;29 at the cellular level this protein change leads to decreased apoptosis29 and increased G cell cycle arrest,41 which we now demonstrate lead to 1 increased survival after life-threatening diseases and overall survival of the entire person (Fig. 8).

The present study thus illustrates that large human studies are sine qua nons of modern biomedical research, and we believe that this represents another lesson from our study: laboratory and popu- lation-based research are each indispensable and complement each other in identifying and describing factors that contribute to human health and disease. In vitro, cell, an animal studies are extremely important for understanding basic mechanisms; however, results from such studies alone will never be able reliably to predict the effect in humans. To study such effects, studies in humans are necessary, preferably by using the golden standard of large population based studies,5 as exemplified in the present study by the Copenhagen City Heart Study.
