the PRNP gene encodes the cellular isoform of prion protein (PrPC). the M129V polymorphism influences the risk of prion diseases and may modulate the rate of neurodegeneration with age. We present the first study of the polymorphism among Polish centenarians. in the control group (n = 165, ages 18 to 56 years) the observed M129V genotype frequencies agreed with those expected according to the hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (MM, MV and VV): 43, 44 and 13% (hWE p > 0.05). among centenarians (n = 150, ages 100 to 107) both homozygotes were more common than expected and hWE was rejected: 46, 37 and 17% (expected 42, 46 and 13%; hWE p = 0.025). this finding is consistent with a higher mortality rate among heterozygotes. however, the observed allele and genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between the oldest-old and the young controls. the genotypic frequencies were not related to severe cognitive impairment

associated with greater brain amyloid deposition.6,7 The codon 129 polymorphism was proposed as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) (MM conferring elevated risk), mild temporal lobe epilepsy and primary progressive aphasia.8-11 Its influence on sur- vival in AD, clinical presentation of idiopathic Parkinson dis- ease and clinical course of neurological Wilson disease has also been reported.12-14 This raises the possibility of selective mor- tality depending on codon 129 genotype. Moreover, in healthy individuals a link between the M129V polymorphism and long- term memory and cognitive performance has been described.15,16 However, not all studies find associations.17-20

The PRNP gene encodes the cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPC: normal conformation; PrPSc: misfolded). There is ample reason to consider inherited variation in the protein as relevant to prion disease: Experimental data implicate PrPC in anti-apoptotic activities, cell signaling and adhesion, synaptic function and protection against oxidative stress (for a review, see ref. 1), although exact physiological mechanisms for normal and altered forms remain elusive. Clearly, misfolding to PrPSc plays a central causal role in the pathogenesis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other spongiform encephalopathies.2 Rare inherited mutations in PRNP cause familial forms of prion diseases. The common M129V methionine to valine polymorphism at codon 129 influences the risks of sporadic and acquired iatrogenic CJD: the homozygous MM and VV genotypes are both over- represented as compared to the heterozygous MV genotype.3,4 All pathologically confirmed cases of variant CJD reported to date are homozygous MM.5

These reported studies concern middle-aged individuals or persons at most in their 80s or 90s, not the oldest-old, who have selectively survived, avoided, fatal condi- In this paper we present the first genetic association study the PRNP codon 129 polymorphism among Polish centenar- (n = 150) comparing genotypic frequencies to those found a sample of younger Poles aged 18 to 56 years (n = 165). the centenarians, genotype frequencies are contrasted subjects with (n = 82) and without severe cognitive impair- (n = 33).

Table 1. Comparison of PRNP codon 129 polymorphism between analyzed groups

We found that the genotypic frequencies in the control group of younger Poles were expectedly consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: MM, 43%; MV, 44%; VV, 13% (HWE p > 0.05). These frequencies are in the range of other reported results. The distribution of the codon 129 genotypes found in different European populations was shown to vary between 35–52% for MM, 39–56% for MV and 9–17% for VV genotypes, placing Poland in the middle of these ranges.7,21-24

Centenarians vs. young controls Centenarians n = 150 Controls n = 165 p Genotype 0.472 MM 69 (46.0) 71 (43.0) MV 56 (37.3) 72 (43.7) VV 25 (16.7) 22 (13.3) allele 0.962 M 194 (64.7) 214 (64.8) V 106 (35.3) 116 (35.2)

Unlike the control subjects, in our centenarian both homozygous genotypes were found more frequently expected (MM, MV and VV): 46, 37 and 17% (expected 46 and 13%), i.e., HWE was rejected (p = 0.025). This is tent with selectively better survival among persons who carry homozygous genotypes to the age of 100 years.

Centenarians with vs. without severe cognitive impairment (s.c.i.)

Centenarians Centenarians with s.c.i. without s.c.i. p n = 82 n = 33 Genotype 0.318 MM 38 (46.3) 15 (45.5) MV 35 (42.7) 11 (33.3) VV 9 (11.0) 7 (21.2) allele 0.420 M 111 (67.7) 41 (62.1) V 53 (32.3) 25 (37.9)

Using the more general hypothesis of unspecified association, directly comparing genotypic frequencies for the two groups of subjects did not provide evidence that centenarians differed from younger Poles in terms of codon 129 polymorphism (Table 1).

No trends were demonstrated for the number of M as opposed to V alleles (0, 1, 2) comparing the two groups (Cochran- Armitage test for trend, p = 0.999). This test has been recom- mended as useful in samples not consistent with HWE.25

We then considered whether codon 129 polymorphism formed part of the genetic background of severe cognitive impairment among centenarians (Table 1). At this sample size (82 subjects with and 33 without severe cognitive impairment), there was no statistically significant evidence that genotypic frequencies dif- fered for the two groups. However, it is noteworthy that hetero- zygotes tended to be more common among the severely impaired (43 vs. 33%). No statistically significant trends in the number of M and V alleles were identified (data not shown).

impairment. The discrepancies may depend on the selection criteria applied for the analyzed groups. This study considered severe cognitive impairment regardless of its origin. These find- ings indicate that prevalence-incidence bias may operate for codon 129 variation and account for differing implications of reported studies. Given the findings of this study, larger studies might demonstrate that codon 129 variation continues to be a determinant of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment at very advanced ages. This is in contrast to the situation for APOE where the ε4 allele is most relevant at relatively younger ages.26

Our results suggest selective survival related to the combina- tion of PRNP codon 129 alleles that have been inherited: the observed deviation from HWE in the centenarian group may result from a higher mortality rate among heterozygotes. The centenarians were not related, so inbreeding as a potential source of the observed deviation from HWE can be excluded. Our find- ing, of course, needs to be verified in other samples. However, it is remarkable that any single common polymorphism demon- strates an effect on longevity. As single factors, APOE ε2 and the absence of APOE ε4 have previously been shown to influence average longevity, explaining perhaps 1% of lifespan.26,27

It was proposed that the oldest individuals may be divided into three groups: the “escapers” who reached the age of 100 free from typical age-related diseases, the “survivors” who live long despite suffering from age-associated diseases and the “delayers”, affected by age-related diseases with an unusually late age of onset.30 The centenarians with cognitive impairment may belong to the two latter groups. Irrespective if they represent the delayers or the survivors, their molecular background of cognitive impairment may be different than in populations analyzed in average AD studies, i.e., usually 20–30 years younger than centenarians. A healthy survival past the age of 100 years may be influenced by a pattern of genetic as well as environmental factors which still remains to be unraveled.

frequencies do not differ significantly between the oldest-old and the young controls (general association). This suggests that the influence of M129V polymorphism on susceptibility for a spectrum of disorders is too weak or the diseases are too rare— as it is in the case of prion diseases—to result in elimination of particular genotype carriers from long-living individuals. Further studies in large groups are necessary to finally elucidate the influence of the PRNP polymorphism on the life-span.

Concerning neurodegeneration, the relevance of M versus V allele needs to be considered more carefully in terms of age, age at onset, duration of disease and method of case acquisition. The results published thus far have been divergent, pointing at VV6,28,29 as well as MM genotype8 as a risk factor for cognitive



We investigated 150 centenarians (130 women and 20 men) aged 100–107, mean age 101.1 ± 1.1 years, who participated in the multicenter scientific project “Genetic and Environmental Factors

of Longevity of Polish Centenarians” (PolStu), coordinated by the International Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology in Warsaw. The individuals were not related. The recruitment of the participants and their general clinical evaluation are described by Mossakowska et al.31

refusal to participate in testing or the participant was otherwise uncooperative.

As controls, we tested DNA samples from 165 blood donors aged 18–56, mean age 27.8 ± 9.1 years; 91 women and 74 men, obtained from the Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Haematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz. These subjects are assumed to represent the same source popula- tion as the centenarians, but with little selection for mortality.

In the present study we used data on cognitive performance extracted from the existing database. Cognitive status was known for 115 centenarians. In 82 individuals severe cognitive impairment had been defined according to the following criteria: (1) clinical diagnosis of dementia done by a neurologist with the use of the established international criteria: DSM IV,32 NINCDS/ ADRDA,33,34 ICD 1034 and Hachinski Ischemic Scale;35 (2) the CDR score of 1 or above; or (3) the MMSE score of 60% or below of a maximum possible score (if clinical diagnosis or CDR score was not available).

The study was performed according to accepted ethical dards and formal approval from the Human Subjects Board.

Genotype for the PRNP codon 129 was determined using an established PCR-RFLP method.36 We investigated Hardy- Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) for the centenarians and for the control subjects. Genotype frequency distributions, and allele frequencies, found for the two subject groups were contrasted using chi-square test. Additionally, Cochran-Armitage test for trend in allele dose (0, 1, 2 alleles) with the use of Monte Carlo method (performed using the XLStat software) was carried out. Statistical significance was assumed at p ≤ 0.05 (two-sided).

In centenarians the maximum MMSE score was established for every person separately, considering his/her age-associated disabilities, such as vision problems. The maximum possible scores differed between the analyzed individuals, so we used the percentages instead of absolute cut-off values.

The criteria of dementia—listed in points 1 and 2—were sat- isfied for 45 centenarians (35 AD patients, 1 vascular dementia and 9 cases of mixed dementia). The subgroup classified accord- ing to point 3 included 37 subjects.

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Acknowledgments

A determination of no severe cognitive impairment was made for 33 centenarians known to have CDR score of 0 or 0.5 or MMSE score of 80% or above of a maximum possible score (when CDR not available). Thirty-five centenarians remained unclassifiable. Among them, 19 subjects did not meet any of the above criteria, and in 16 cases, the cognitive status was not assessed due to several typical reasons: deafness, nei- ther cognitive testing nor interviews were possible, there was
