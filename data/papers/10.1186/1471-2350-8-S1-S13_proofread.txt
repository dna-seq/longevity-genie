Abstract

Family studies and heritability estimates provide evidence for a genetic contribution to variation in lifespan. We conducted a genome-wide association study (Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip) for longevity-related traits in a community-based sample. We report on five longevity and aging traits in up to 1345 Framingham Study participants from 330 families. Multivariable-adjusted residuals were computed using appropriate models (Cox proportional hazards, logistic or linear regression), and the residuals from these models were used to test for association with qualifying SNPs (70,987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call rate ≥80%, minor allele frequency ≥10%, Hardy-Weinberg test p<0.001).

Results

In family-based association test (FBAT) models, eight SNPs in two regions approximately 500 kb apart on chromosome 1 (physical positions 73,091,610 and 73,527,652) were associated with age at death (p-value <10-5). The two sets of SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium (minimum r2 = 0.58). The top 30 SNPs for generalized estimating equation (GEE) tests of association with age at death included rs10507486 (p=0.0001) and rs4943794 (p=0.0002), SNPs intronic to FOXO1A, a gene implicated in lifespan extension in animal models. FBAT models identified seven SNPs, and GEE models identified nine SNPs associated with both age at death and morbidity-free survival at age 65, including rs2374983 near PON1. In the analysis of selected candidate genes, SNP associations (FBAT or GEE p-value <0.01) were identified for age at death in or near the following genes: FOXO1A, GAPDH, KL, LEPR, PON1, PSEN1, SOD2, and WRN. Top-ranked SNP associations in the GEE model for age at natural menopause included rs6910534 (p=0.00003) near FOXO3a and rs3751591 (p=0.00006) in CYP19A1. Results of all longevity phenotype-genotype associations for all autosomal SNPs are web-posted at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007.

Conclusion

Longevity and aging traits are associated with SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K GeneChip. None of the associations achieved genome-wide significance. These data generate hypotheses and serve as a resource for more genes and biological pathways proposed as contributing to longevity and healthy aging previously reported to be associated with longevity in model organisms or humans.

Background

Genetic factors associated with human longevity and healthy aging remain largely unknown. Heritability estimates of longevity derived from twin registries and large population-based samples suggest a significant but modest genetic contribution to the human lifespan (heritability ~15 to 30%) [1-4]. However, genetic influences on lifespan may be greater once an individual achieves age 60 years [5]. Moreover, the reported magnitude of the genetic contribution to other important aspects of aging such as healthy physical aging (wellness) [6], physical performance [7,8], cognitive function [9], and bone aging [10] are much larger. Both exceptional longevity and a healthy aging phenotype have been linked to the same region on chromosome 4 [11,12], suggesting that although longevity per se and healthy aging are different phenotypes, they may share some common genetic pathways.

Methods

Study sample

The genotyped study sample is comprised of 1345 Original cohort (n=258) and Offspring (n=1087) participants who are members of the 330 largest FHS families. The Overview [24] provides further details of this sample. With respect to aging and longevity traits, 149 deaths occurred at a mean age at death of 83 years (range 46 to 99 years), and 713 participants achieved age 65 yearsinvolved in the regulation of DNA repair and genes in the evolutionarily conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway [13,14] are emerging as holding great promise in the future elucidation of the underlying physiology controlling lifespan. Many of these genes have human homologs and thus have the potential to provide insights into human longevity [15-20]. Although numerous candidate genes have been proposed, studies in humans are limited and initial findings often fail replication [21,22]. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become feasible and offer a more comprehensive and untargeted approach to detect genes with modest phenotypic effects that underlie common complex conditions [23]. Both the Original Cohort and the Offspring Cohort remain under continuous surveillance, and all deaths that occurred prior to January 1, 2005, were included in this study. Deaths were identified using multiple strategies, including routine participant contact for research examinations or health history updates, surveillance at the local hospital, search of obituaries in the local newspaper, and if needed through use of the National Death Index. Death certificates were routinely obtained, and all hospital and nursing home records prior to death and autopsy reports (if performed) were requested. In addition, if there was insufficient information to determine a cause of death, the next of kin were interviewed by a senior investigator. All records pertinent to the death were reviewed by an endpoint panel comprised of three senior investigators. The date and cause of death (classified as due to coronary heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular disease [CVD], cancer, other causes or unknown cause) were recorded. We had the opportunity to use the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Affymetrix 100K SNP genotyping resource for a GWAS of longevity and aging-related phenotypes. The FHS offers the unique advantage of a longitudinal family-based community sample with participants who have been well-characterized throughout adulthood with respect to prospectively ascertained risk factors and diseases and continuously followed until death. We report several strategies for 100K SNP associations: 1) a simple low p-value SNP ranking strategy; 2) SNP selection due to associations with more than one related phenotype; and 3) SNP associations within candidate genes and regions. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate martingale residuals using the PHREG procedure in SAS to perform the regression analysis of survival time from age at study entry to age at death. Models were sex-specific and adjusted for 1) birth cohort and 2) birth cohort, education, current smoking status (yes/no), obesity (body mass index 30 kg/m2), hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive treatment), elevated cholesterol (cholesterol > 239 mg/dL), diabetes (fasting blood sugar 126 mg/dL, random blood sugar of 200 mg/dL, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents), and comorbidity defined as CVD and cancer. Birth cohort was defined as a categorical variable for all regression models with the following categories based on year of birth: birth year prior to 1900, 1900 to 1909, 1910 to 1919, 1920 to 1929, 1930 to 1939, 1940 to 1949, and 1950 and later. All covariates were measured at study entry. Residuals from Original Cohort and Offspring participants were pooled.

Walking speed was measured on Original Cohort participants at examination 27 (January 2002 through December 2003, mean age of Original Cohort at exam 27: 86.7 years) and Offspring participants attending an ancillary study to examination 7 (1999 to 2004, mean age at exam: 62.0 years). Trained technicians timed participants walking at their normal pace on a four-meter course twice and subsequently asked participants to repeat the course walking at a rapid pace. The mean timed fast walk among Offspring participants in the 100K genotyping sample was 2.44 seconds (standard deviation 0.89). The timed fast walk was used for analysis. Sex-specific linear regression was used to generate residuals adjusted for age and height measured at the time of the walk.

Morbidity-free survival was defined as achieving age 65 years free of CVD, dementia, and cancer. CVD events included angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), intermittent claudication, and coronary or CVD death. Suspected CVD events were reviewed by a panel of three investigators who adjudicated events using previously established criteria in place since study inception [25]. A separate panel of study neurologists determined the presence of stroke or TIA, and a team of at least onemenopause in the FBAT analysis, SNP associations ranked numbers 6 and 7 were rs1121980 (p-value 0.0002) and rs2278493 (p-value 0.00027), both are in the vicinity of the MSRA gene. 

The study analyzed the effects of genetics on longevity and aging traits. Residuals generated from linear and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. The study used genotyping on Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip and Marshfield STR genotyping to determine age at natural menopause. Statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards, logistic regression, and linear regression were used to compute residual traits for analysis. Family-based association tests and generalized estimating equations were used to test for association between genotyped individuals and SNPs. The study found eight SNPs on chromosome 1 associated with age at death in FBAT analysis, with two sets of SNPs clustered in two regions approximately 500 kb apart. Several strategies were used to prioritize SNPs associated with longevity and aging traits, including an untar- geted approach, exploring consistency of SNP associations across related sets of traits, and investigating SNP associations in candidate genes and regions reported to be associated with longevity identified from established databases.In the study of menopause, the GEE model revealed top-ranked SNP associations including number 11, rs6910534 (p = 0.00003) near FOXO3a and number 18, rs3751591 (p = 0.00006) in CYP19A1. Table 2c presents the LOD scores of 2.0 and the corresponding 1.5-LOD support interval from genome-wide linkage for the three quantitative aging traits. None of the regions overlapped with SNPs associated with these aging traits in the FBAT and GEE analyses. Notably, for biologic age by OSS, the linkage peak on chromosome 21 confirmed a prior Framingham Study report using a genome-wide scan with 401 microsatellite markers [10]. Table 3 provides all SNP associations with a GEE or FBAT p-value < 0.01 for both traits within the two pairs of related traits. For age at death and morbidity-free survival at age 65 years, FBAT models identified seven SNPs and GEE models identified nine SNPs associated with both traits including rs2374983 near PON1 (Tables 3a and 3b). For biologic age by OSS and walking speed, thirteen SNPs in FBAT models and six SNPs in GEE models were associated with both traits (Tables 3c and 3d). The SNPs were annotated using the UCSC genome browser tables using the May 2004 assembly http://genome.ucsc.edu/[31,32]. All genes within 60 kb of the top-ranked SNPs were identified.

The longevity and aging traits available in the FHS 100K SNP resource are listed in Table 1. In this report, we consider only five of the traits listed in Table 1: multivariable-adjusted age at death, morbidity-free survival at age 65 years, age at natural menopause, walking speed, and biologic age by OSS. These traits include a pooled sample of Original Cohort and Offspring participants, with the exception of walking speed, which is reported in Offspring. We identified from the literature 79 potential candidate genes and regions associated with longevity (see Additional file 1 for listing). Of these, 12 genes had no SNPs and 67 genes had 1 to 45 SNPs within 60 kb of the gene.

The most strongly associated SNP near WRN is actually closer to PURG related phenotypes, and 100K SNP genotyping results are available on the web. Several strategies are described to prioritize SNP associations in this unique resource to enhance the discovery of various genes and pathways that contribute to the control of human longevity. Furthermore, FHS investigators are part of the NIA-sponsored Longevity Consortium http://www.longevityconsortium.org, which offers the opportunity for collaboration with other investigators to replicate important findings in additional cohorts.

Forkhead box group O (FOXO) transcription factors are targets of insulin-like signaling and are involved in a diverse set of physiological functions, including DNA repair and resistance to oxidative stress [33,34]. Further, FOXO plays a role in lifespan extension in C. elegans and Drosophila [35]. Studies of this gene in humans are limited; two case-control studies have not identified an association between FOXO1a and longevity [36,37]. However, the prospective population-based Leiden 85-plus Study found that FOXO1a was associated with increased mortality attributable to diabetes-related deaths in participants aged 85 years and older [38]. The Leiden 85-plus Study also reported that genetic variation causing a reduction in insulin/IGF-1 signaling resulted in improved old age survival among women [20]. However, that report examined other genes in the insulin/insulin-like signaling pathway and did not specifically examine FOXO1a.

Finally, the untargeted approach to SNP selection also identified a SNP near FOXO3a associated with age at natural menopause. This gene has been implicated in oocyte death, depletion of functioning ovarian follicles, and infertility in mice [39,40] and thus represents a plausible candidate gene for menopause. Most positive common gene variant-disease association studies have failed replication [41], including reports on exceptional longevity. Haplotype-based fine mapping of the region on chromosome 4 linked to human longevity initially suggested the MTP gene, a gene important in lipoprotein synthesis, was associated with longevity [21]. However, this association failed replication in a French cohort of long-lived individuals and subsequent case-control studies of nonagenarians [22,42]. Beekman et al [43] found neither linkage to chromosome 4 nor association with the MTP gene and longevity among nonagenarians in the Leiden Longevity Study. Meta-analyses implicated admixture of the control sample in the original report as an explanation for the presumed false-positive association. Thus, our findings are hypothesis-generating, and their importance cannot be determined without evidence of consistent replication in other populations.

Several important limitations merit comment. First, we acknowledge that there may be a survival bias as participants in this sample had to survive to provide DNA (first systematic DNA collection began 1995) and hence are likely healthier than the full FHS sample. To ameliorate this issue, we adjusted for covariates using the full Framingham sample and used the residual traits for the subset of individuals genotyped using the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip to test for association with the SNPs using linear regression models. Residual traits from Cox and logistic models typically are not ideally distributed for linear regression models, but our adjustment method using the full sample precludes testing SNP associations with age at death and morbidity-free survival using Cox and logistic models. Second, the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip provides limited coverage of the genome; many of our a priori candidate genes did not have any SNP coverage on the chip. For example, several genes that have been studied in model organisms or even in humans such as ACE, Lamin A, SIRT2, and SIRT3 had no SNPs within 60 kb of the gene on the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip. However, genotyping is near-complete for the NHLBI funded 550 K genome-wide scan on all FHS participants. This will enable deeper exploration of our initial 100K SNP associations in a larger sample with denser coverage of the genome. Third, in this analysis, we did not examine epistasis or gene-environment interactions, which may modify the associations in this study. Importantly, this study is hypothesis-generating. Our findings need to be replicated in other samples.

We examined pleiotropic effects by identifying SNP associations across two pairs of related traits. One SNP near PON1 emerged as associated with both age at death and morbidity-free survival. Surprisingly, there were relatively few SNPs associated with both traits; prior work had suggested that longevity per se and healthy aging may share common genetic pathways [11,12]. However, morbidity-free survival was measured at age 65 years; it is possible that as our participants age, morbidity-free survival defined atIdentify novel biological pathways related to lifespan control. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) also have the potential to direct investigators of human aging to the most promising candidate gene associations and biological pathways reported to regulate lifespan in animal models. Enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for aging may, in turn, identify directions for health promotion and disease prevention efforts in middle-aged and older adults so that older persons can enjoy more time in good health. These data generate hypotheses regarding novel biological pathways contributing to longevity and healthy aging and serve as a resource for replication of findings from other population-based samples. Our strategy of selecting SNPs in candidate genes and regions previously reported to be associated with longevity yielded interesting findings. For age at death, we identified SNPs in or near several genes, including KL, LEPR, PON1, SOD2, and WRN. Defects in the WRN gene are the cause of Werner Syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature aging. A longitudinal study of aging Danish twins recently reported a possible association between a successful aging trait and 3 SNPs in the WRN gene [44]. We were unable to determine if our SNP (rs2725369) was in LD with the SNPs in the prior report because the SNPs were not included in HapMap. Mutations in the KL (Klotho) gene in the mouse lead to a syndrome resembling human aging [45-47]. There has been one report linking a functional variant of the KL gene to human longevity [15]. Thus, results from this GWAS may direct resources to the most relevant candidate genes and pathways for further investigation in humans.
