SIRT1 accomplishes this by regulating the FOXO (Forkhead box transcription) factors, a family of proteins that function as sensors in the IIS pathway and influence mammalian longevity (17).

component, yet little is known about its genetic antecedents. Increasing evidence from animal models suggests that the insulin/ IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is an important, evolutionarily con- served biological pathway that influences aging and longevity. How- ever, to date human data have been scarce. Studies have been hampered by small sample sizes, lack of precise phenotyping, and populationstratification,amongotherchallenges.Therefore,tomore precisely assess potential genetic contributions to human longevity from genes linked to IIS signaling, we chose a large, homogeneous, long-lived population of men well-characterized for aging pheno- types, and we performed a nested-case control study of 5 candidate longevity genes. Genetic variation within the FOXO3A gene was strongly associated with human longevity. The OR for homozygous minor vs. homozygous major alleles between the cases and controls was 2.75 (P  0.00009; adjusted P >= 0.00135). Long-lived men also presented several additional phenotypes linked to healthy aging, including lower prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular disease, better self-reported health, and high physical and cognitive function, despite significantly older ages than controls. Several of these aging phenotypeswereassociatedwithFOXO3Agenotype.Long-livedmen also exhibited several biological markers indicative of greater insulin sensitivity and this was associated with homozygosity for the FOXO3A GG genotype. Further exploration of the FOXO3A gene, human longevity and other aging phenotypes is warranted in other populations.

Genetic knock-out models in mammals (and other species) have also supported the IIS hypothesis. For example, mice with a fat-specific insulin receptor knockout (FIRKO) have reduced fat mass, protected against age-related obesity, and have extended longevity (21). Many other mutations in the IIS pathway appear to impact longevity in mice. These include mutations in the IGF-1 receptor (22), IRS-1 (22), IRS-2(23), PAPP-A (24), and the Ames

The basic molecular pathway of insulin signaling is conserved through evolution, evidence of which can be seen in yeast, flies, worms, rodents, and humans (25). A key regulator of this pathway in worms is the transcription factor DAF-16 (abnormal DAuer Formation-16), which is required for the large lifespan extension produced in C. elegans by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling (16). A number of factors appear to extend lifespan in C. elegans in a DAF-16 dependent manner, such as AMP kinase (26), 14–3-3 proteins (27), the lin-4 microRNA (28), and heat shock factor (29). HomologuesofDAF-16inseveralspecieshavebeenlinkedtoaging phenotypes and longevity (30). For example, the stress responsive Jun-N-K terminal kinase (JNK) pathway appears to require FOXO to prolong lifespan in Drosophila (31), and when flies over express dFOXO, the DAF-16 ortholog, it can increase lifespan (32). The convergence of such a diverse array of signals on DAF-16/FOXO suggests that this protein may be an important, evolutionarily conserved ‘‘node’’ in a signaling network that impacts aging and longevity.

uman longevity is a complex phenotype with multiple deter- minants. While non-genetic factors, including diet, physical activity, health habits, and psychosocial factors are important, up to 50% of the variation in human lifespan might be explained by genetic differences (1–5). Several studies suggest that about 25% of the variation in human lifespan in average-lived populations can be explained by genetic factors, but in populations with larger numbers of exceptional survivors, the genetic contribution to lifespan may be much higher. For example, family studies of nonagenarians and centenarians show that sibling relative risk, a common method for assessingpotentialgeneticcontributiontoacomplexphenotype(6), is particularly high and grows with increasing age of the proband (7–10). However, studies of candidate ‘‘longevity-associated’’ genes in humans, hereafter referred to as ‘‘longevity genes,’’ have gen- erally been disappointing. Few replications have been observed across populations, with the exception of the APOE gene (3).

The human homologue of DAF-16 includes four FOXOs: FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6. We hypothesize that common, natural variation in the form of single nucleotide poly- morphisms (SNPs) in FOXO and related genes might influence human aging and longevity. A connection between insulin, FOXO, oxidative stress, and human longevity would be particularly inter- esting since oxidative stress has long been a favorite putative mechanism of aging. Since 1956, the free radical theory of aging has hypothesized that aging results partly from damage to DNA, cells, and tissues from cumulative exposure to reactive oxygen molecules

In contrast, there have been several robust genetic findings in model organisms of aging (11–13). For example, variation in single genes can result in substantial differences in lifespan in model organisms, particularly with genes that are considered part of the insulin/IGF-1 (IIS) signaling pathway (14–18).

(33) and although not yet universally accepted, supportive evidence has accumulated over the years (34, 35). Thus, FOXO may provide a potential forkhead or bridge between insulin signaling, free radicals, and human aging/longevity.

From this 1991–1993 baseline population, we selected all partic- ipants who, by 2007, had survived to age 95 years or more as Phy ‘‘longevity’’ cases (n 213). We then selected all participants who pean died before the age of 81 years as ‘‘average-lived’’ controls (n 402). Baseline characteristics of the cases and controls are pre- sented in Table 1. In terms of biological characteristics, the long- lived cases were older, leaner (lower waist:hip ratio), had lower triglycerides (borderline), lower glucose, lower insulin levels, and higher prevalence of the FOXO3A3 allele at the baseline exami- nation. The cases also had better self-rated health and lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease [coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke] and cancer. Functionally, they appeared better able to walk but had lower grip strength. There was no difference

There has been some prior work linking genes in the IIS pathway to human longevity (36, 37) including an interesting recent report by Suh et al. (38), which links functionally significant IGF-1 receptor mutations to exceptional longevity, but we have not found any published reports of association between FOXO genes and human longevity. Prior studies have found links between FOXO genes and other aging phenotypes, including 4-year survival and stroke risk (39) as well as premature menopause (40).

Human longevity, however, is a complex phenotype that encom- passes disease-specific risks as well as the individual rate of aging. The study of its genetic antecedents is challenging. The study of longevity may be affected by small genetic effect sizes, population stratification artifact, population heterogeneity, lack of sufficient numbers of long-lived study participants, and other problems (3, 4, 41). Therefore, to assess potential genetic contributions to human longevity from genes linked to IIS signaling, we chose a large, homogeneous, long-lived population of men well-characterized for aging phenotypes, and we performed a nested-case control study of 5 candidate longevity genes with links to the IIS pathway. These genes were chosen based on prior associations with aging pheno- types principally from gene knockout, transgenic, mutant, and other model organisms (3, 4, 14–17, 36, 42). Priority was for genes involving insulin sensing and glucose (energy) homeostasis.

Five genes were investigated (ADIPOQ, FOXO1A, FOXO3A, SIRT1, and COQ7). Minor allele frequencies and other related genetic information for the cases and controls are presented in Table 2. However, only FOXO3A genotype was associated with om<I longevity using an initial cut-off value of P 0.05.

Further investigation comparing the genotype frequencies of FOXO3A3 between cases and controls revealed a highly significant difference P   0.00009 for the Pearson’s exact (cid:1)2 statistic (Table 3). Five loci with 3 SNPs within each allele were tested (Table 2). Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons resulted in a corrected p value of 15 xX | 0.00009   0.00135. Due to the high LD between the 3 SNPs of FOXO3A, we further investigated the FOXO3A3 SNP only (rs 2802292). The OR for homozygous minor vs. homozygous major alleles for FOXO3A3 between the cases and controls was 2.75 (95% CI: 1.51  5.02, P ar)(  0.0007), and the OR for heterozygous vs. homozygous major alleles between the cases and controls was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.34 | 2.72, P Ue 0.0003). These results suggest an additive effect on longevity.

Discussion

To understand more about the longevity phenotype at younger ages, we compared the proportion of people who were healthy at the baseline examination (1991–1993) for each of the three FOXO3A genotype groups using the definition of healthy survival from Willcox et al. (44). The differences were highly significant (Table 4). Those who possessed one or more G alleles were more likely to be healthy at baseline than those who were homozygous for the major (TT) allele; 75% of those homozygous for the minor allele were healthy at the baseline examination vs. 57% of those homozygous for the major allele. After adjusting for case-control status, the differences were still marginally significant. This suggests remaining association of the allele with health status in cases and controls.

The rapid aging of the population will place unprecedented disability (45). Better understanding of mechanisms of including biological pathways that may have widespread on how we age, could have important implications for lowering risk for age-related disease and disability. There are many ically plausible candidate genes for human longevity but only finding has so far been widely replicated in multiple that of the APOE gene (3). This gene has widespread effects and as such influences the ability to achieve a long and healthy

To find other such genes, it may be helpful to use model organisms to identify a priori potential candidates before conduct- ing human studies. Therefore, we chose to study several candidate genes within the human insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and/or oxidative stress response system on the basis of sequence and/or functional homology with model organisms of aging or prior human studies. We constructed a list of human candidate genes (Table S2) fromthesesignalingpathwaysandassessedvariationsinthesegenes   occurring at a frequency of 10% in the Japanese population. Three SNPs were chosen from each gene for analysis. SNPs were selected mainly from regions with linkage disequilibrium (LD) for maximal coverage of each gene.

Toassesswhethertherewasarelationbetweeninsulinsensitivity, a potential intermediate phenotype of longevity, and genotype, we tested the relation between fasting insulin, glucose, HOMA and genotype (Table 5). For non-normally distributed variables we used log conversion to a normal distribution. There was a significant relation between insulin, log insulin, HOMA and genotype. Ho- mozygosity for the G allele was associated with markedly lower insulin, log insulin and HOMA score, but in controls only.

We also tested for a relation between lifetime prevalence of several chronic diseases and FOXO3A genotype (Table 6). A significant protective relation was found for homozygosity for the GallelewithregardtoprevalenceofCHDandaborderlinerelation for cancer. Finally, we assessed the FOXO3A3 MAF distribution by maximum attained age in all participants combined. The MAF increased markedly with age (Table 7).

Analysis of five candidate genes demonstrated that one gene clearly stood out from the others in terms of a potential human longevity gene—FOXO3A. That this gene might be important to human longevity is supported by several lines of evidence. First, in nested case-control analyses, variation within this gene was strongly associated with longevity. Furthermore, two copies of the G allele conferred about twice the protective effect (suggesting an additive

also had metabolic profiles suggesting higher insulin sensitivity at younger ages, with lower waist to hip ratio, lower glucose, insulin, and HOMA values (Tables 1 and 5). Several phenotypes were associated with variation in FOXO3A genotype.

Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in diabetes prevalence between cases and controls. However, since the cases were more than a decade older than controls, and diabetes tends to increase markedly with age, it is noteworthy that prevalence of diabetes was not significantly different. In fact, both cases and controls had a high prevalence of diabetes (near 60%), despite relatively low BMI. Why Type 2 diabetes tends to be more prevalent in Japanese at a relatively low BMI is not completely understood (50).However,theremaybemetabolicdifferencesinJapanese(and some other Asians) with higher visceral fat in Asians at lower BMI than in whites and blacks (51, 52). Indeed, Japan national guidelines reflect such population differences and consider Japanese obese at a BMI of 25 (53). Other contributing factors to the high prevalence of diabetes in the HHP/HAAS cohort are that participants were tested for diabetes by several clinical methods and at several examinations making detection more likely.

effect), roughly tripling the odds of living close to a century. minor allele frequency also rose markedly from septuagenarian centenarian ages (Table 7).

Second, all three SNPs that we assessed in the FOXO3A gene, which were in tight LD, were strongly correlated with the longevity phenotype. This indicates that the finding was unlikely to be due to chance. Third, carriers of the minor (G) alleles were healthier at the   baseline examination, 15 years prior (Table 4).

In fact, the baseline examination suggested that cases were markedly healthier than controls despite the fact that cases were, on average, 11 years older. The cases possessed significantly less age-related disease, including less prevalent CHD, stroke, and cancer. They also had better self-rated health and generally had high physical function, including less difficulty walking. Interest- ingly, despite being more than a decade older than controls, the longevity cases had similar levels of cognitive function. This sup- ports the existence of a ‘‘healthy aging’’ phenotype where individ- uals somehow delay or avoid major clinical disease and disability until late in life. The healthy aging phenotype that we observed in cases is similar to the healthy aging phenotypes reported in cente- narians at younger ages when compared to their age-matched birth cohorts (46–48) and in centenarian offspring (49). Long-lived cases

plasma insulin levels as well as CHD, cancer, and Type 2 diabetes prevalence. This is consistent with a known role for FOXO as a mediator of the effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factors on diverse physiological functions, including cell proliferation, apopto- sis, and metabolism (17, 54). Genetic studies in C. elegans and Drosophila have shown that FOXO proteins are ancient targets of insulin-like signaling that regulate metabolism and longevity. Ad- ditional work in mammalian cells has shown that FOXO proteins are the targets of protein kinases, influence cell cycle progression, and regulate resistance to oxidative stress in vitro (54). In vivo studies have shown that FOXO modifies hepatic glucose output in response to insulin and mediates other metabolic actions (54). This strengthens the evidence that FOXO proteins may mediate insulin effects on metabolism and influence longevity in humans.

Table 6. Prevalence of aging-related phenotypes in relation to FOXO3A3 genotype

FOXO3A in human health, aging, and longevity. The association of FOXO with diverse aging phenotypes, including insulin sensitivity, CHD, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and longevity, is suggestive of a ‘‘gatekeeper’’ role in the IIS pathway. An important downstream mechanism whereby FOXO3A might influence human aging is through modification of oxidative stress—a long held theory of how we age (33), although we have no direct evidence for this in the current study. However, since FOXO genes are the closest human homologues of C. elegans DAF-16, which protects cells from oxidative stress, this is a plausible mechanism of action for modi- fication of human aging (17). In C. elegans, DAF-16 increases the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), which converts superoxide to less damaging hydrogen peroxide and is a potent endogenous protector against free radicals (55), among other ‘‘anti-aging’’ effects. In vivo studies show that oxidative lesions in DNA, proteins, and other tissues accumulate with age and feeding calorically restricted diets (a potent insulin sensitizer) to rodents (56) and humans (57) mitigates this damage.

adjacent SNPs in the FOXO3A gene. Third, the findings are biologically plausible and support the prior findings in animal models and also support the limited prior human studies. Fourth, the case-control associations with longevity were detected using a nested case-control analysis with a high event rate (deaths) during a long period of follow-up. Fifth, the HHP cohort is highly homogenous and no population stratification was detected.

a modulating effect of genotype on insulin levels in both groups. It is tempting to speculate that since the cases showed greater insulin sensitivity no matter what their genotype, they have multiple mechanisms to maintain insulin sensitivity other than FOXO. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that most longevity genes havemodestorsmalleffectsizes.Itisalsopossiblethatsmallsample size limited our ability to detect differences in the cases. On the other hand, long-lived mice carrying mutations in either IRS-1 (58) or IRS-2 (23) are actually insulin resistant, so insulin sensitivity is not a necessary condition for mutations in the IIS pathway to be able to confer greater longevity.

A possible drawback is that since the cases and controls had an average age difference of 11 years we cannot exclude birth cohort as a confounder. But this is unlikely since there was a maximum 19-year difference in birth years between participants. Also, suba- nalyses revealed no differences in education and occupation (data not shown) between cases and controls. Moreover, it was the participants who were older at baseline who were more likely to have lived to 95-plus years and thus obtain the longevity phenotype. Most cohort effects show health advantages for younger cohorts.

However, it is interesting to note that in C. elegans, several genes that by themselves may have small effects on lifespan are influenced by the transcription regulating ‘‘master gene’’ DAF-16 (59). Small differences in FOXO3A that may be otherwise difficult to detect, could theoretically modify several downstream genes related to DNA binding, protein–protein interactions, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and metabolism. In this manner, a small modifying effect by FOXO3A potentially has larger, additive downstream effects on aging phenotypes and longevity.

In summary, we found that common, natural genetic variation within the FOXO3A gene was strongly associated with human longevity and was also associated with several phenotypes of healthy aging. Further study of FOXO genes and aging phenotypes is warranted in other populations.

Supportive evidence is beginning to accumulate for a role of insulin-signaling in human aging and longevity, but the genes that might mediate these effects are not known. Prior studies have found over or under representation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the insulin-IGF-1signaling pathway in long-lived hu- mans of Italian (36), Japanese (37, 42), Dutch (60), and Ashkenazi Jewish (38) ethnicity, with links to several aging phenotypes. While some of these findings have been limited by small effect sizes and marginal statistical significance, the study by Suh et al. (38) also demonstrated that functionally significant mutations in the IGF-1

Subjects and Methods

Study Population. This nested-case control study was conducted as part of the HawaiiLifespanStudy,anembeddedcohortstudyofhealthyagingdrawnfrom theoriginalpopulationoftheHonoluluHeartProgram(HHP)andHonoluluAsia Aging Study (HAAS). The HHP is a population-based, prospective study of car- diovasculardiseaseamong8006JapaneseAmericanmenthatbeganin1965.The HHP participants were recruited from 9877 men with valid contact information who were born from 1900–1919 and living on the island of Oahu (61).

StudyparticipantshadbothparentsfromJapan,usuallythewestandsouthern parts of Japan (61, 62). Although most participants were born in Hawaii (88%), thereisatheoreticalpossibilityofconfoundingofcasecontrolstatuswithallele frequencies due to geographic origin. Therefore, for certain analyses, cases and controlswerestratifiedbyparentalprefectureoforiginusingconditionallogistic regressionmodels.Analysesshowednoevidenceforpopulationstratificationin thedataset(datanotshown).TheHHPcohorthasbeendescribedelsewhere(62). Briefly, surveillance of hospital records, obituaries, and national databases has resulted in extensive morbidity and mortality data (adjudicated by an expert committee) and near complete follow-up (61–63).

To date, there has been little study of FOXO genes and pheno- types of aging in humans. Two recent studies suggest that FOXO genes deserve further scrutiny. First, a longitudinal study of elderly Dutch men and women found that a FOXO1A haplotype predicted 4-year survival and that a FOXO3A haplotype predicted stroke risk (39). Second, the Framingham Study, in a genome-wide association analysis, found that a FOXO3A SNP was strongly associated with aol)(  age at natural menopause in women (P 0.00003). However, the Dutch findings were not statistically significant when accounting for multiple comparisons and both studies need replication. The present study is supportive and extends the associations of FOXO3A to human longevity and insulin sensitivity.

All participants for the current study were drawn from records of study participants updated to August, 2007. Archived phenotypic data and blood samples from Examination 4 of the HHP (1991–1993), which coincided with the commencement of the Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HAAS), was used as the baselineexaminationforthisnestedcase-controlstudy.TheHAASwasbegunas anexpansionoftheHHPforthestudyofneurodegenerativediseases,cognitive function, and other aging phenotypes in elderly persons (64). Participants in- cluded 3741 men aged 71 to 93 at Examination 4 (mean age 77.9 a. 4.7 years), approximately half the number of the original HHP (64).

One of the major advantages of the current study is that it used a nested case-control design. This study design selects cases and controls from an ongoing cohort study with longitudinally collected data. Therefore, several phenotypes of interest (e.g., disease prev- alence, health status, function) were obtained by direct clinical examination when the participants were younger, making the data less subject to recall bias.

For the purposes of the current nested case-control study, ‘‘cases’’ (longevity phenotype)weredefinedasallHHPparticipantswhohadsurvivedtoatleastthe upper1%ofthe1910U.S.birthcohortspecificsurvival(minimum95yearsofage) fromthetimeofrecruitment(65,66).Atotalof213individualswhohadsurvived toatleast95yearsofage,asofAugust2007,werestudied.Oftheseindividuals, 176 had died (mean death age 97.5; SD 2.1; range of 95–106 years) and 37 individuals were still alive (mean age 98.7, SD 2.1; range 97–106 years).

Indeed, studies of exceptional survivors, such as centenarians, that have found evidence for phenotypes suggestive of slower aging (46–48) could potentially suffer from significant recall bias. That is, older participants may not recall precisely their past medical history and their past functional status. However, in the current study, major diseases were adjudicated by a morbidity and mortality committee and performance-based measures of physical and cog- nitive function were used to supplement self-reports, and evidence was found for such a healthy aging phenotype. This lends prospec- tive support to previous retrospective work.

Thecontrolsconsistedof402individualsfromtheHHP/HAAScohortwhodied near the mean death age for the 1910 U.S. birth cohort specific survival for middle-agedmen((cid:8)77yearsofage).Toachieveacase:controlratioof(cid:8)1:2,we sampledtheHHP/HAASstudypopulationforcontrolswhodieduptotheageof 81years.Themeanageatdeathforourcontrolpopulationwas78.5years(SD1.8, range 73–81 years). This is slightly higher that of the U.S. male population, but consistent with the high average life expectancy of Japanese-American men in Hawaii,whichwas3.5yearslongerthanwhitemalesatlastreport(67).Allwere ethnic Japanese (61, 62).

Procedures were performed according to institutional guidelines and ap- proved by the Institutional Review Board of Kuakini Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants or from family rep- resentatives if participants could not provide consent.

There are several other strengths to this study. First, the candi- date genes selected for analysis were chosen a priori based on hypothesis-driven criteria. That is, studies of models organisms of aging employing various methods, particularly knockouts, have shown that the IIS pathway is important for aging and longevity. Andmanyfunctionsappeartobeevolutionarilyconserved.Second, the findings are strong, highly significant, and include several

Genotyping. We chose 3 SNPs from each of 5 candidate genes. We chose genes that have well-described influences on aging pathways in model organisms. All geneswerechosenbasedonhypotheticallinkstotheIISpathwayandpotential

Statistical Analysis. SNPs were evaluated for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The Pearson (cid:1)2 test was used to compare the cases and controls for equal genotype frequencies using the software program StatXact (68). For esti- mates of strength of association, odds ratios were estimated using logistic re- gression models from SAS (69). General linear model and analysis of covariance were further used to compare proportion of healthy study participants by FOXO3A genotype. For the analysis of aging phenotypes in case and controls, Student’s t test for comparing distribution of continuous variables and (cid:1)2 for proportional variables.
