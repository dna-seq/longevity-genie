The focus of human genetics in recent years has shifted toward identifying genes that are involved in the development of common diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and Alz- heimer’s disease. Because many complex diseases are late-onset, the frequencies of disease susceptibility alleles are expected to decrease in the healthy elderly individuals of the population at large because of their contribution to disease morbidity and(cid:1)or mortality. To test this assumption, we compared allele frequencies of 6,500 single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in (cid:1)5,000 genes between DNA pools of age-stratified healthy, European-American individuals. A SNP that results in an amino acid change from Ile to Val in the dual-specific A kinase-anchoring protein 2 (D-AKAP2) gene, showed the strongest correlation with age. Subsequent analysis of an inde- pendent sample indicated that the Val variant was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the length of the electrocardio- gram PR interval. The Ile(cid:1)Val SNP is located in the A-kinase-binding domain. An in vitro binding assay revealed that the Ile variant bound (cid:1)3-foldweakertotheproteinkinaseA(PKA)-RI(cid:1)isoformthantheVal variant. This decreased affinity resulted in alterations in the subcel- lular distribution of the recombinantly expressed PKA-RI(cid:1) isoform.

Age-stratified samples appear to be useful for screening SNPs to identify functional gene variants that have an impact on health.

likely to be absent from such a sample because they are less likely to be eligible for donating blood. Hence, the frequency of a disease susceptibility allele is expected to be lower in samples of older blood donors. Similarly, a protective allele would be seen at a higher frequency in the older sample. We define variants with a decreased frequency due to morbidity and, to a small extent, mortality as diseasesusceptibilityalleles.Theidentificationoflongevitygenesby comparing genetic markers between young and elderly individuals, usually octogenarians or centenarians, has become more popular in recent years (3). The well known age-related associations of Alzheimer’s disease and risk of cardiovascular disease with the “Mu  4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene provides the initial proof of concept (4, 5). However, our approach is clearly distinct from the previous approaches because our samples are primarily selected as being healthy and not by age.

Materials and Methods

Study Sample. All subjects involved in our studies signed a written informed consent and the institutional ethics committees of par- ticipating institutions approved the experimental protocols. Sub- jects for the disease susceptibility genome screen were part of a sample that was recruited during a routine blood donation from private blood collection centers in San Bernardino and Rancho Mirage, California. The staff of the blood collection agencies invited all healthy blood donors to participate, and helped the subjectsfilloutaconsentformandasimplepersonaldatacollection form before sample collection. The data collection form included information about age, sex, body size, personal and family disease history, and ethnic background of both parents. Information about the identity of the study participants was not recorded. Subjects would be excluded if they failed to meet the blood donation eligibility guidelines established by the American Red Cross. A summary of the samples collected is presented in Table 1. Ethnicity was defined for each subject if they identified both parents as having wenc/g the same ethnic geographic background, otherwise they are indi- cated as ‘‘Other.’’ For the purpose of identifying disease suscepti- bility associated SNPs, we derived from this collection a discovery cohort consisting of male and female European Americans divided (26 into young (18–39 years) and old ( 60 years) groups. These groups and others used in this study are shown in Table 2.

ast efforts to identify susceptibility genes for common diseases have considered association studies using markers of candidate genes in samples of cases and controls or linkage analyses using markers of genome variation in samples of pedigrees. Both of these approaches have critical limitations. Candidate gene studies are generally limited to a small number of genes already suggested to be involved in the disease pathway. They provide little opportunity for novel gene discovery in a disease field. Linkage analyses to study common diseases have proven to be very expensive, and in very few cases have they resulted in the identification of a disease suscepti- bility gene. The shared public and private efforts to identify and validate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genome-wide (1) and improvements in SNP measurement technologies have en- hanced the feasibility of genome-wide association studies. Such studies are expected to be much more powerful than traditional linkage analysis methods for identifying genes involved in common diseases (2).

Rather than searching for genes based on their influence in a specific disease, our aim is to screen for susceptibility genes that have a significant influence on late-onset diseases in the general population. Instead of considering clinical samples for a conven- tional case-control study, we chose to sample healthy individuals ascertained through blood donation centers. Our hypothesis is that older individuals carrying disease susceptibility alleles are more

For this study, 97 traits were selected to explore possible disease associations. The selected traits have connections to many disease areas, including cardiovascular dis- eases, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and osteoporosis.

DNA Extraction and Genotyping. DNA from 10 ml of blood from each blood donor was extracted by using a desalting method (Gentra Systems), and quantitated fluorimetrically (Fluoroskan Ascent CF, Labsystems, Chicago) by using Pico green. Age-, gender-, and ethnicity-specific pools were generated by pooling equimolar amounts of each DNA sample to a final concentration g/l. of 5 ng l. All PCR and MassEXTEND reactions were conducted by using standard conditions, and both alleles were analyzed to calculate allele frequencies as described elsewhere (7–9).

Specific A-Kinase-Anchoring Protein 2 (D-AKAP2). Orthologous se- quences were identified with PSI-BLAST (11) against the NCBI nonredundant database by using mouse D-AKAP2 (SwissProt O88845) as query sequence and a BLOSUM62 weight matrix (12). Sequences unequivocally identified as orthologues from Homo sapiens (SwissProt O43572), Sus scrofa (SwissProt P57770), Drosophila melanogaster (SW:Q9V3I3), and Caenorhabditis elegans (SwissProt Q10955) were obtained from SwissProt. Partial sequences from Anopheles gambiae (GenBank accession no. AJ281189) and Gallus gallus (GenBank accession no. AJ398916) were derived from GenBank EST sequences.

Statistical Analysis. Estimates of allele frequencies derived from pooled DNA were based on independent mass spectrometry mea- surements of four analyte aliquots derived from a single PCR reaction (8, 9). The median standard deviation for these values was awe 0.01. For comparing allele frequencies between the young and old pools, females and males were analyzed separately. The statistic used to test the difference in allele frequencies between pools was of the form

Recombinant D-AKAP2 Variant Construction and Functional Interac- tions with PKA Subunits. GST fusion constructs were made by fusing the 40 C-terminal amino acids of D-AKAP2 to the C terminus of GST as described by Huang et al. (13) and subcloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pRSET (Invitrogen). The constructs were transfected into BL21 cells and expressed for 6 h at 20°C. The cells were lysed in PBS with 5 mM BME and 0.1% Triton X-100.

Here pˆ and pˆ are Y O (cid:1)2 (cid:1)2 the allele frequency estimates and and are estimates of Y O measurement variability calculated from measurement replicates in the young and old pools, respectively. In this study, we made no attempt to correct for additional sources of variation or for multiple aaaient testing. Rather, SNPs were identified that had P values 0.05 among all measured SNPs, followed by a second, independent measurement of all significant SNPs based on three separate PCRs ofeachDNApool.Theresultsofthesecondroundofmeasurement were analyzed in a manner similar to the first round, and were compared for consistency. SNPs that showed statistically significant differences between young and old groups from pooled DNA analyses were individually genotyped for final validation.

Twenty-seven-residue peptides containing the two AKB domain variants of D-AKAP2 with a C-terminal cysteine were synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA). The peptides were HPLC purified and the molecular mass verified by mass spectrometry. Both peptides were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Molecular Aimlaa ce Probes) at the cysteine residue and HPLC purified. RI and RII   “_1/3 were serially diluted into 10 mM Hepes 150 mM NaCl 3 mM wat\/0 EDTA 0.005% polysorbate 20 containing 10 nM fluorescently wowla t labeled peptide.

Estimates of allele frequencies using individual genotype were found by using the gene counting method. Comparisons allele frequencies as well as genotype frequencies between were carried out by using a (cid:6)2 test of independence.

The SNPs found to be associated with age were further analyzed for association with disease-related quantitative traits in the twin

Fluorescence anisotropy was monitored by using a Fluoromax-2 (Spex, Jobin Yvon Horiba) equipped with polarizers. The fluoro- phore was excited at 541 nm (5- to 10-nm bandpass) and emission was monitored at 575 nm (5- to 10-nm bandpass). For each protein, fluorescence anisotropy was monitored for three separate binding experiments. The data were averaged and fit to a 1:1 binding model by using the nonlinear regression application in GRAPHPAD PRISM version 3.00 (GraphPad Software).

Subcellular Localization of D-AKAP2 Variants. The 30-aa mitochon- drial-anchoring domain of D-AKAP1 (14) was fused to the C- terminal 156 residues of mouse and human D-AKAP2, respectively, followed by a Flag-tag and subcloned into pcDNA4 (Invitrogen). n/d >/E The N terminus, including the dimerization docking (D D) do- p AADAE en  main of RI (residues 1–109) and full-length RII were each fused with GFP and cloned into pEGFPN1 (BD CLONTECH). Equal molar ratios of the Flag-tagged D-AKAP2 constructs and either aacTa-(   pr ACEy/I RII -GFP or RI -D D-GFP constructs were mixed and trans- —-1/2 fected into 10T(1 2) cells by using cytofectene (Bio-Rad). The AKB domain was detected by immuno-staining with monoclonal antibodies against the Flag-tag (Kodak) followed by rhodamine- conjugated secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory). The cells were imaged by using a Zeiss microscope equipped with a digital camera. Each channel was exposed for the same amount of time.

Results

Identification of D-AKAP2 as a Candidate Gene. We identified 50 markers of the 6,500 tested markers that show a reproducibly significant allele frequency change between the two age groups in a<< at least one gender (P 0.05). The SNP that demonstrated the strongest association with age in both genders is located within the D-AKAP2 gene.

Genome-Wide SNP Analysis for Morbidity Gene Discovery. The

tations for conducting genome-wide association studies by geno- typing each subject with a dense panel of genetic markers include high costs, use of relatively large amounts of DNA and the extensive time requirements for such an endeavor. We have pursued a strategy that utilizes estimates of allele frequencies in DNA pools tobeabletoscreenlargenumbersofSNPsinaquickandaffordable manner (8, 9, 15). To apply this to disease susceptibility gene discovery, we divided the European-American individuals by age (under 40 and over 60 years) and by sex (Table 2). The fraction of included subjects reporting any health problem was only 1.8% and 2.9%inyoungfemalesandmales,and3.8%and3.5%inoldfemales and males, respectively. In this study, we used a collection of 6,500   exonic SNPs located in 5,000 genes or EST clusters. The majority ofassaysfortheseSNPs,originallyidentifiedinan insilicodiscovery project, were developed in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (7).

D-AKAP2 codes for dual-specific A-kinase anchor protein 2, which is part of a family of scaffold proteins known as A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (13, 18). AKAPs bind the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent PKA, and target the kinase to various intracellular locations, localizing cAMP-mediated activation of the kinase (19). PKA is a broad specificity kinase and phosphorylates numerousproteinsthatfunctioninmanyessentialcellularprocesses such as metabolism, gene transcription, cell division, and neuronal transmission. In the inactive state, PKA is a tetramer consisting of two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits. The dual specificity of D-AKAP2 is defined by its ability to bind both the RI

There is some concern with the strategy of using samples collected through blood donation centers in a rapidly growing, highly mobile and ethnically diverse population such as Southern California to compare allele frequencies between young and old groups. One concern is potential inaccuracies in the self-reporting of ethnic or geographic background, particularly age-dependent biases. Another concern is that the older and younger generations may represent different compositions of geographic heritage. Such confounders could lead to differences in allele frequencies for reasons unrelated to health and lead to false inferences. To address these concerns, we obtained estimates of allele frequencies from a subset of 271 markers randomly selected from the larger SNP panel in the four European-American pools, as well as pools of subjects of reported African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic- American ethnicity (described in Table 2). We used these estimates to calculate Nei’s genetic distance between pools (16), which is illustrated in the neighbor-joining tree (17) in Fig. 1. The lengths of the branches are proportional to the pairwise genetic distances between pools. The distances between the old and young groups of European Americans are roughly equal and relatively small com- pared with the distances between the three other ethnic pools. This argues against the role of age-dependent population admixture as the explanation for the differences in allele frequencies observed between young and old groups.

 An A 3 G polymorphism in the 3 UTR of D-AKAP2 showed   num>< ( a significant decrease of 8% (P 0.01) of the G allele in the older sample of both genders (Table 3). The marker was individually genotyped and the frequency differences between young and old individuals calculated from the genotypes were very similar to the pool results. There was a slight skewing of frequencies in the pools likely resulting from uneven PCR amplification of the two alleles. This led to an underestimation of the G allele frequency in all pools butdidnotimpactthesignificanceofthedifferencesbetweenyoung and old (Table 3).

To identify common polymorphisms in the D-AKAP2 gene, we sequenced the 15 exons and 100–200 bp of the flanking sequence (Fig. 4, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS website, www.pnas.org). The analysis of 36 chromosomes revealed only two additional polymorphisms: An A 3 G SNP in intron 10, six nucleotides downstream from exon 10 (In10), and an A 3 G SNP in exon 14, leading to an amino acid substitution Ile to Val at position 646 (I646V). Individual genotyping of the European- American samples showed that the intron 10 SNP exhibits no morbidity-association. The I646V polymorphism, however, was found to be significantly different between young and old in both   ait tM> males (P 0.03) and females (P 0.009) (Table 3). There was no significant difference between young males and females and be-

The estimates of the disequi- Aw iliac3 librium (D ) between the 3 UTR and the I646V and In10 SNPs were 0.991 and 0.255 (r2 a2 —  0.55 and 0.03), respectively. The distance (eave3 between the markers in strong disequilibrium, 3 UTR and I646V Ae  which both showed association, is 4 kb, whereas the intron 10 SNP aes  is located 23 kb upstream of I646V (Fig. 4).

As expected, the changes in genotype frequencies between age groups for the three sites showed a similar level of statistical significance as the changes in allele frequencies (data not shown). a At the 3 UTR and the I646V variable sites, GG homozygotes were reducedandAAhomozygotesincreasedintheoldersampleofboth genders. This further supports the hypothesis that the G allele, which determines the Val allele at I646V, is associated with a negative health impact.

We also genotyped Hispanic-American samples for the I646V variation. Because we had only a small number of Hispanic- American individuals over 60 years of age, we extended the older sample to all individuals older than 50 years of age (Table 2). Although females showed a statistically significant allele frequency   difference between old and young (P 0.008), the males did not, which may be due to the relatively small number of male individuals (Table 3). However, the allele frequency differences in both gen- ders were comparable to those observed in European Americans. The frequency of the G allele decreased by 0.129 in females and 0.061 in males, the GG homozygote by 0.087 in females and 0.072 in males (data not shown). These results further support the d/o association of the Val allele with morbidity and or mortality, and therefore the involvement of this gene in one or several disease processes. We subsequently verified another nonsynonymous D- AKAP2 variation, retrieved from dbSNP. The G–A transversion in exon 4 results in an Arg to His substitution at position 249 (R249H). The Arg was found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with the Ile at position 646, occurring together in every case, and therefore shows the same age effect.

Functional Analysis of the D-AKAP2 Amino Acid Variant. The variable position resulting from the SNP (I64V) is located in the AKB domain of D-AKAP2. This domain is the docking site for PKA (13) and is highly conserved among species (Fig. 2a). Similar to other AKAPs the AKB domain is predicted to form an amphipathic helix

Association of D-AKAP2 Genotypes with a Cardiac Trait. In an effort to identify traits correlated with the observed age association of the I646V SNP, we used a cohort of 417 fasting white twin pairs with extensive coverage for a variety of disease-related traits. Of the 97 traits analyzed, only the PR interval was statistically significant at a

with hydrophobic amino acids on one face of the helix (21, 22). The length of the hydrophobic side chains on the hydrophobic face of the helix can alter PKA binding specificity (23, 24). The AKB domain of D-AKAP2 interacts with RI and RII isoforms of PKA and determines the extent of subcellular localization of PKA. The presence of two potential RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) motifs suggests the involvement of D-AKAP2 in G protein- mediated signal transduction (13, 18, 25). A putative PDZ-binding motif (TKL) at the C terminus is a protein-protein recognition module that plays a central role in organizing diverse cell signaling assemblies (26). The R249H variant is located in a spacer separating two halves of a potential RGS domain. The conservation of this position and surrounding sequence is very low compared with the AKB domain. Because there is no interaction partner identified for this spacer, the potential functional effect of R249H was not analyzed further.

To determine whether the D-AKAP2 Ile Val variation resulted in an alteration in its binding properties to PKA, the binding of each variant to the regulatory subunits of PKA was investigated. Binding of each AKB domain variant to PKA was first examined by using an in vitro pull-down assay, in which the 40 C-terminal residues of D-AKAP2 containing the AKB were fused to glutatione S- e/\ transferase (GST) (Fig. 2b). The Ile Val substitution resulted in an aterla i isoform-specific difference in PKA binding. The RI isoform of PKA bound with a significantly higher affinity to the Val variant (Fig. 2b). The higher affinity was seen for both the mouse and the human AKB domains. The residue differences between mouse and ate/\ human downstream of the Ile Val position had no effect on the binding properties. Moreover, there was no difference in binding of JEN  the variants to the RII isoform (Fig. 2b).

In contrast, both variants show no apparent differences for (g–l) binding; they all colocalize at mitochondria (h and k).

Val variant is the apparent deleterious allele in a European- American cohort, and this finding is replicated in Hispanic Americans. The variant maps to the conserved AKB domain of the D-AKAP2 gene. The I646V variation impacts the binding to PKA in an isoform-specific manner both in vitro and in cells. The rr @  Ile variant binds three-fold weaker to the RI isoform than to the Val variant. At the cellular level, this affinity difference ati results in a dramatic decrease in compartmentalization of RI for the Ile variant. In the accompanying manuscript by Burns- vueie  Hamuro et al. (29), we provide further evidence that the Ile Val nela i variant is critical for binding to only the RI isoform of PKA.

Toassessthemagnitudeoftheaffinitydifference,bindingofboth variants to the R isoforms was analyzed in a quantitative assay. Peptides of each AKB variant were synthesized and fluorescently labeled. Binding of these peptides to the regulatory subunit iso- forms was monitored by an increase in steady state fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 2c). There was no difference in binding of the AKB i=Ta ¢ Ip i variants to either the RII or RII isoforms. In addition, the RII eeTa i isoforms bound tighter to the variants than the RI isoform (Fig.  2c Inset). However, as indicated by the pull-down experiments, RI displayed differential binding to the AKB variants. The Val variant had a nearly three-fold increase in binding affinity when compared with the Ile variant. The interaction was specific because no binding lat was observed to a deletion construct of RI that lacked the AKAP ARONETa). binding domain (delta1–91RI ).

How the RI specific binding differences of the D-AKAP2 variants translate into a health risk is likely to be complex. Com- partmentalization by AKAPs is known to play an important role in the specificity and regulation of cAMP-mediated signaling of PKA (19). The cellular evidence presented here by using the mitochon- drial-targeted form of D-AKAP2 suggests that the Ile variant has aaa  reduced ability to compartmentalize RI PKA. Therefore, de- creased compartmentalization of type I PKA may have an advan- tageous health effect. This effect could be direct by decreasing PKA signaling through D-AKAP2-Ile anchored PKA or indirect by aTa ii redistributing the local pools of RI in cells that have an important impact on health.

To determine whether the observed in vitro affinity differences resulted in a difference in cellular compartmentalization, we ex- aminedtheassociationoftheAKBvariantsandthePKAregulatory subunits in cells. In this assay, the AKB domains of D-AKAP2 from mouse (Val) and human (Ile) were fused to the mitochondrial anchoring domain of D-AKAP1, respectively, and tethered to the outer mitochondrial membrane (27, 28). The binding of the AKB domain to the PKA regulatory subunits was detected as the cotransfected PKA regulatory domains colocalized to the mito- chondria.Asexpected,boththeValandIleAKBvariantscantarget Ta RII to the mitochondria effectively, in accordance with their ~~ W.lat similar affinity in vitro (Fig. 3 h and k). However, for RI there was a difference in colocalization between the variants. The Val variant effectively targeted RI(cid:7) to the mitochondria (Fig. 3b). The Ile variant, however, was unable to target RI(cid:7) , which was evenly diffused in the cytosol (Fig. 3e) demonstrating that the Ile variant of D-AKAP2 has impaired ability to sequester RI(cid:7) .

Increasing evidence suggests that the RI and RII isoforms of PKA have distinct functions (30). The RI isoform has been implicated in a variety of biological functions such as cell proliferation (31), tumor suppression (32, 33), immune regula- tion (34), and embryonic development (35, 36). In addition, the wae RI isoform plays a significant role in maintaining cAMP regulation of PKA as evidenced by the embryonic lethality of mice deficient in the gene (35). Interestingly, these mice have defects in cardiac morphogenesis.

The correlation of the I646V variant with the EKG PR interval indicates that this polymorphism might be a predisposing factor for a cardiac phenotype. Individuals homozygous for the Val variant exhibit shorter atrium depolarization intervals (PR) than individ- uals homozygous for Ile. This phenotypic correlation combined with literature reports supporting a role for AKAP-mediated PKA signaling in normal cardiac function suggest plausible hints of how the Val variant may lead to pathogenesis.

Discussion

We have identified SNPs in the D-AKAP2 gene that are asso- ciated with morbidity by using a genome-wide association study from an age-stratified healthy population and 6,500 gene-based SNPs. The combined genetic and biochemical evidence points to the Ile(cid:1) Val variant as the functional polymorphism. The

PKA phosphorylates numerous substrates in response to - adrenergic stimulation that influence the contractility of cardiac myocytes (37). Some of these substrates include the L-type Ca2(cid:10)

channel, the ryanodine receptor, and phospholamban of the sar- coplasmic reticulum. AKAP-mediated targeting of PKA in cardiac myocytes has also been directly implicated in regulating cell con- tractility (38). Three AKAPs have been shown to interact with PKA in cardiac myocytes; muscle-selective AKAP (mAKAP), AKAP18 and Yotiao. mAKAP targets PKA to the perinuclear region of differentiated myocytes, coordinating both PKA and phosphodies- terase activity in a single complex (39). AKAP18 couples PKA to L-type Ca2(cid:10) channels, which enhances Ca2(cid:10) influx through the  channel after -adrenergic stimulation (40). Yotiao, an AKAP associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (41), has JES | been shown to interact with the KCNQ1-KCNE1 K channel subunits in human hearts (42). Mutations in this channel associated with hereditary long QT syndrome abolish Yotiao interactions with the channel, and attenuate the response mediated by cAMP (42).

channel or ion exchanger. The D-AKAP2 variants could impact the phosphorylation state of the ion channel or ion exchanger by etlaa recruiting different amounts of PKA-RI and might thereby mod- ulate heart contraction. This hypothesis fits the observed associa- tion with an EKG phenotype. The shorter depolarization intervals for Val(cid:1) Val individuals might be due to increased activation of ion channels in cardiac myocytes. However, the identification of this phenotypic association does not exclude the possibility that other phenotypic traits might be associated with this variant. Because it was identified by a general morbidity approach, it is possible that this functional variant has an impact on several biological pathways and can potentially lead to multiple clinical phenotypes.

In summary, we have demonstrated that screening for SNPs by using age-stratified healthy individuals is a useful and efficient way to identify functional variants in genes associated with morbidity. Because it is based on samples from the general population, this strategy may be able to identify major genetic components with significant health impacts and high penetrance. Through subse- quently analyzing significant morbidity markers in another well- phenotyped healthy twin population, we were able to associate a cardiac phenotype with the D-AKAP2 genotypes. This genetics approach may be able to establish early entry points into under- standing critical pathways that affect human health.

Direct involvement of PKA in developing heart disease comes from a recent study in which transgenic mice overexpressing the catalytic subunit of PKA developed dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced cardiac contractility and increased risk of arrhythmias (43). These cardiac abnormalities correlated with PKA-mediated hyper- phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor and Ca2(cid:10) release from wepTa i the sarcoplasmic reticulum (43). RI is likely to play a role in cardiac physiology because it is the predominant isoform associated withthesarcolemmaincardiacmyocytes(44,45).Infact,mutations oakTa g in the RI gene are associated with both familial cardiac myxomas and Carney complex, implicating this isoform in cardiac growth and differentiation (32, 33).

The PKA signaling pathways associated with D-AKAP2 are not known. However, D-AKAP2 contains a PDZ binding motif (TKL) at the C terminus (Fig. 2a), which could serve as a targeting domain to membrane-bound receptors, ion channels or ion exchangers (26), ws? and two RGS domains, which could coordinate upstream G signaling with downstream PKA signaling. D-AKAP2 might there- fore be part of a signaling complex associated with a cardiac ion
