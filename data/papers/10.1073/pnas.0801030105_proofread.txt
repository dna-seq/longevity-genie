FOXO3A genotype is strongly associated with human longevity. Bradley J. Willcox*, Timothy A. Donlon*, Qimei He*, Randi Chen*, John S. Grove*, Katsuhiko Kamal H. Masaki*, D. Craig Willcox*,**, Beatriz Rodriguez*, and J. David Curb* conducted a study to assess the potential genetic contributions to human longevity from genes linked to IIS signaling. The insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, an important evolutionarily conserved biological pathway that influences aging and longevity, has been studied in animal models. However, human data has been limited due to small sample sizes, lack of precise phenotyping, and population stratification, among other challenges. The researchers chose a large, homogeneous, long-lived population of men well-characterized for aging phenotypes and performed a nested-case control study of 5 candidate longevity genes.

Genetic variation within the FOXO3A gene was strongly associated with human longevity. Long-lived men also presented several additional phenotypes linked to healthy aging, including lower prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular disease, better self-reported health, and high physical and cognitive function despite significantly older ages than controls. Several of these aging phenotypes were associated with FOXO3A genotype. Long-lived men also exhibited several biological markers indicative of greater insulin sensitivity, which was associated with homozygosity for the FOXO3A GG genotype.

The basic molecular pathway of insulin signaling is conserved through evolution, evidence of which can be seen in yeast, flies, worms, rodents, and humans. A key regulator of this pathway in worms is the transcription factor DAF-16, which is required for the large lifespan extension produced in C. elegans by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Homologues of DAF-16 in several species have been linked to aging phenotypes and longevity.

Human longevity is a complex phenotype with multiple determinants, including genetic differences. Several studies suggest that about 25% of the variation in human lifespan in average-lived populations can be explained by genetic factors. However, studies of candidate longevity-associated genes in humans have generally been disappointing, with few replications observed across populations.

In contrast, there have been several robust genetic findings in model organisms of aging. For example, variation in single genes can result in substantial differences in lifespan in model organisms, particularly with genes that are considered part of the insulin/IGF-1 (IIS) signaling pathway. Mutations that increase SIR-2 activity or that decrease IGF-1 signaling both increase the lifespan of C. elegans by the DAF-16/FOXO protein.

The researchers conclude that further exploration of the FOXO3A gene, human longevity and other aging phenotypes is warranted in other populations.

MAF, minor allele frequency; CASI, cognitive abilities screening instrument. Characteristics, general health status, disease prevalence, and functional status are presented (33), and although not yet universally accepted, supportive evidence has accumulated over the years (34, 35). Thus, FOXO may provide a potential forkhead or bridge between insulin signaling, free radicals, and human aging/longevity. From this 1991-1993 baseline population, we selected all participants who, by 2007, had survived to the age of 95 years or more as Phy longevity cases (n=213). We then selected all participants who died before the age of 81 years as average-lived controls (n=402). Baseline characteristics of the cases and controls are presented in Table 1. In terms of biological characteristics, the long-lived cases were older, leaner (lower waist:hip ratio), had lower triglycerides (borderline), lower glucose, lower insulin levels, and a higher prevalence of the FOXO3A3 allele at the baseline examination. The cases also had better self-rated health and a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease [coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke] and cancer. Functionally, they appeared better able to walk but had lower grip strength. There was no difference.

There has been some prior work linking genes in the IIS pathway to human longevity (36, 37), including an interesting recent report by Suh et al. (38), which links functionally significant IGF-1 receptor mutations to exceptional longevity, but we have not found any published reports of association between FOXO genes and human longevity. Prior studies have found links between FOXO genes and other aging phenotypes, including 4-year survival and stroke risk (39), as well as premature menopause (40).

Human longevity, however, is a complex phenotype that encompasses disease-specific risks as well as the individual rate of aging. The study of its genetic antecedents is challenging. The study of longevity may be affected by small genetic effect sizes, population stratification artifact, population heterogeneity, lack of sufficient numbers of long-lived study participants, and other problems (3, 4, 41). Therefore, to assess potential genetic contributions to human longevity from genes linked to IIS signaling, we chose a large, homogeneous, long-lived population of men well-characterized for aging phenotypes, and we performed a nested-case control study of 5 candidate longevity genes with links to the IIS pathway. These genes were chosen based on prior associations with aging phenotypes principally from gene knockout, transgenic, mutant, and other model organisms (3, 4, 14-17, 36, 42). Priority was given to genes involving insulin sensing and glucose (energy) homeostasis.

Five genes were investigated (ADIPOQ, FOXO1A, FOXO3A, SIRT1, and COQ7). Minor allele frequencies and other related genetic information for the cases and controls are presented in Table 2. However, only FOXO3A genotype was associated with longevity using an initial cut-off value of P=0.05. Further investigation comparing the genotype frequencies of FOXO3A3 between cases and controls revealed a highly significant difference P<0.00009 for the Pearson's exact χ2 statistic (Table 3). Five loci with 3 SNPs within each allele were tested (Table 2). Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons resulted in a corrected p-value of 0.00135. Due to the high LD between the 3 SNPs of FOXO3A, we further investigated the FOXO3A3 SNP only (rs2802292). The OR for homozygous minor vs. homozygous major alleles for FOXO3A3 between the cases and controls was 2.75 (95% CI: 1.51-5.02, P=0.0007), and the OR for heterozygous vs. homozygous major alleles between the cases and controls was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.34-2.72, P<0.0003). These results suggest an(RS 2802292) Table 4: Difference in Health Status Between Genotype Groups at Baseline

Several phenotypes were associated with variation in FOXO3A genotype.

Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in diabetes prevalence between cases and controls.However,since the cases were more than a decade older than controls and diabetes tends to increase markedly with age,it is noteworthy that the prevalence of diabetes was not significantly different. In fact, both cases and controls had a high prevalence of diabetes (near 60%), despite relatively low BMI. Why type 2 diabetes tends to be more prevalent in Japanese at a relatively low BMI is not completely understood (50). However, there may be metabolic differences in Japanese (and some other Asians) with higher visceral fat in Asians at lower BMI than in whites and blacks (51, 52). Indeed, Japan national guidelines reflect such population differences and consider Japanese obese at a BMI of 25 (53). Other contributing factors to the high prevalence of diabetes in the HHP/HAAS cohort are that participants were tested for diabetes by several clinical methods and at several examinations making detection more likely.

FOXO3A in Human Health, Aging, and Longevity

The association of FOXO with diverse aging phenotypes, including insulin sensitivity, CHD, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and longevity is suggestive of a gatekeeper role in the IIS pathway. An important downstream mechanism whereby FOXO3A might influence humanRevealed no differences in education and occupation (data not shown) between cases and controls. Moreover, it was the participants who were older at baseline who were more likely to have lived to 95-plus years and thus obtain the longevity phenotype. Most cohort effects show health advantages for younger cohorts. However, it is interesting to note that in C. elegans, several genes that by themselves may have small effects on lifespan are influenced by the transcription regulating master gene DAF-16 (59). Small differences in FOXO3A that may be otherwise difficult to detect could theoretically modify several downstream genes related to DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and metabolism. In this manner, a small modifying effect by FOXO3A potentially has larger additive downstream effects on aging phenotypes and longevity. In summary, we found that common, natural genetic variation within the FOXO3A gene was strongly associated with human longevity and was also associated with several phenotypes of healthy aging. Further study of FOXO genes and aging phenotypes is warranted in other populations. Supportive evidence is beginning to accumulate for a role of insulin-signaling in human aging and longevity, but the genes that might mediate these effects are not known. Prior studies have found over or under-representation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the insulin-IGF-1 signaling pathway in long-lived humans of Italian (36), Japanese (37, 42), Dutch (60), and Ashkenazi Jewish (38) ethnicity, with links to several aging phenotypes. While some of these findings have been limited by small effect sizes and marginal statistical significance, the study by Suh et al. (38) also demonstrated that functionally significant mutations in the IGF-1 pathway confer longevity.
 
Subjects and Methods
 
Study Population:
 
This nested case-control study was conducted as part of the Hawaii Lifespan Study, an embedded cohort study of healthy aging drawn from the original population of the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) and Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HAAS). The HHP is a population-based, prospective study of cardiovascular disease among 8006 Japanese-American men that began in 1965. The HHP participants were recruited from 9877 men with valid contact information who were born from 1900-1919 and living on the island of Oahu (61). Study participants had both parents from Japan, usually the west and southern parts of Japan (61, 62). Although most participants were born in Hawaii (88%), there is a theoretical possibility of confounding of case-control status with allele frequencies due to geographic origin. Therefore, for certain analyses, cases and controls were stratified by parental prefecture of origin using conditional logistic regression models. Analyses showed no evidence for population stratification in the dataset (data not shown). The HHP cohort has been described elsewhere (62). Briefly, surveillance of hospital records, obituaries, and national databases has resulted in extensive morbidity and mortality data (adjudicated by an expert committee) and near-complete follow-up (61-63).
 
To date, there has been little study of FOXO genes and phenotypes of aging in humans. Two recent studies suggest that FOXO genes deserve further scrutiny. First, a longitudinal study of elderly Dutch men and women found that a FOXO1A haplotype predicted 4-year survival and that a FOXO3A haplotype predicted stroke risk (39). Second, the Framingham Study, in a genome-wide association analysis, found that a FOXO3A SNP was strongly associated with age at natural menopause in women (P = 0.00003). However, the Dutch findings were not statistically significant when accounting for multiple comparisons and both studies need replication. The present study is supportive and extends the associations of FOXO3A to human longevity and insulin sensitivity.
 
All participants for the current study were drawn from records of study participants updated to August 2007. Archived phenotypic data and blood samples from Examination 4 of the HHP (1991-1993), which coincided with the commencement of the Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HAAS), were used as the baseline examination for this nested case-control study. The HAAS was begun as an expansion of the HHP for the study of neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive function, and other aging phenotypes in elderly persons (64). Participants included 3741 men aged 71 to 93 at Examination 4 (mean age 77.9 ± 4.7 years), approximately half the number of the original HHP (64).
 
One of the major advantages of the current study is that it used a nested case-control design. This study design selects cases and controls from an ongoing cohort study with longitudinally collected data. Therefore, several phenotypes of interest (e.g., disease prevalence, health status, function) were obtained by direct clinical examination(MGB) Quenchers were used to enhance the detection of assays. The PCR products were measured using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System.
