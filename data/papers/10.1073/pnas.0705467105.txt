tance of this regulatory network for exceptional longevity in human populations is uncertain, especially because living to 100 years of age is a rare phenotype in humans with a prevalence of 1 in 10,000 individuals in the general population (9). Even if we adopt the premise that the basic mechanisms that modulate longevity and determine the rate of aging are common to all multicellular organisms, it is possible that the observed effects on longevity of candidate gene variants will prove to be exclusively associated with laboratory strains and may have fitness cost (10, 11). Thus, it remains to be demonstrated whether candidate loci with major effects on longevity in model organisms such as genes involved in the insulin/IGFI pathway will show segregating allelic variation in human populations.

Rather than being a passive, haphazard process of wear and tear, lifespan can be modulated actively by components of the insulin/ insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) pathway in laboratory animals. Complete or partial loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding components of the insulin/IGFI pathway result in extension of life span in yeasts, worms, flies, and mice. This remarkable conserva- tion throughout evolution suggests that altered signaling in this pathway may also influence human lifespan. On the other hand, evolutionarytradeoffspredictthatthelaboratoryfindingsmaynot be relevant to human populations, because of the high fitness cost during early life. Here, we studied the biochemical, phenotypic, and genetic variations in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenar- ians, their offspring, and offspring-matched controls and demon- strated a gender-specific increase in serum IGFI associated with a smaller stature in female offspring of centenarians. Sequence analysis of the IGF1 and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) genes of female centenarians showed overrepresentation of heterozygous muta- tions in the IGF1R gene among centenarians relative to controls that are associated with high serum IGFI levels and reduced activity of the IGFIR as measured in transformed lymphocytes. Thus, genetic alterations in the human IGF1R that result in altered IGF signaling pathway confer an increase in susceptibility to human longevity, suggesting a role of this pathway in modulation of human lifespan.

Previous studies in humans have reported on levels of IGFI and related molecules in the oldest old (12); however, interpret- ing these values was difficult because of the lack of adequate controls. To overcome this shortcoming, we established a unique cohort of individuals with exceptional longevity and their off- spring (approximate age 70 years) and age- and sex-matched controls without a family history of unusual longevity; all of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. This group of offspring of individuals with exceptional longevity and their matched controls is a powerful tool for identifying genetically controlled longevity traits and led to the identification of longevity phenotypes such as lipoprotein sizes and the subsequent discovery of correspond- ing longevity genotypes (13, 14). Here, we report the use of this unique cohort to identify partial loss-of-function mutations in the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) gene that are overrepresented among centenarians compared with controls, suggesting a role for the IGF signaling pathway in human longevity.

he role of reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) signaling in lifespan extension is well established in inverte- brates (1). During evolution, the insulin/IGFI pathways have diverged from a single receptor in invertebrates to multiple receptors and more complicated pathways and regulatory net- works in mammals (2). Insulin regulates metabolic pathways, whereas IGFI and growth hormone (GH), the main regulator of circulating IGFI, control growth and differentiation (3). In mice, knockout models of the insulin receptor (IR) pathway have a negative impact on lifespan and age-related diseases (4). In contrast, both spontaneous and targeted genetic disruptions of the GH/IGF pathway are associated with small size (dwarfism), numerous indices of delayed aging, enhanced stress resistance, and a major increase in lifespan (5), suggesting a role for the GH/IGF pathway in murine longevity. Furthermore, caloric restriction, the measure linked to life extension and retardation of aging-related pathology, is also associated with reduced circulating IGFI levels (6). On the other hand, reduced levels of IGFI in humans, while protective against cancer, constitute a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (7). Moreover, human aging is associated with a decline in the levels of GH and IGFI, and it has been proposed that GH therapy may reverse some of the physiological features of aging (8). Therefore, at the current time, the role of IGF signaling in human longevity is far from clear.

Results

Height and IGFI Levels in the Offspring of Centenarians. Because plasma levels of IGFI in centenarians do not reflect their levels at a younger age, we compared the levels of IGFI in offspring of centenarians to controls without a family history of longevity to identify a potential alteration in the IGF signaling pathway, which may contribute to exceptional longevity. Remarkably, ath female offspring (n 105) showed 35% higher serum IGFI   levels (P 0.01) compared with female controls (n 67), suggesting a possible alteration in the GH/IGF pathway in the longevity of females (Fig. 1A). This phenomenon was gender-   specific, as IGFI levels in male offspring (n 92) and male

 controls (n 42) were identical (Fig. 1A). To distinguish whether the high IGFI is caused by increased production or is a result of IGF insensitivity, we assessed maximal reported height, a necessary parameter because of the height shrinkage that occurs in the elderly. Female offspring were 2.5 cm shorter AM>< compared with controls (P 0.001), whereas the height of males was identical in offspring and controls (Fig. 1B). Thus, a likely explanation for this finding is that the higher IGFI levels represent a compensatory response to reduced IGFIR signaling, which would also be associated with a small decrease in maximal height, (although a less bioactive IGFI molecule is also a possibility). Remarkably, this combination of a female-specific effect on longevity, higher IGFI levels, with a small reduction in auxological growth, is highly reminiscent of a report on female mutant mice haploinsufficient for the IGFIR, which display nearly identical features, including gender-specific lifespan ex- tension (15).

among centenarians compared with controls was statistically ene Ae significant (P 0.04). Genotyping of the offspring of the centenarian mutation carriers shows that none of the offspring harbor these rare mutations.

Genotyping the IGF1RMutations in the Entire Cohort. We genotyped

the entire cohort (384 centenarians and 312 controls) for the i>A presence of the two nonsynonymous mutations, i.e., 244G A yas3>A (Ala-37–Thr) and 1355G A (Arg-407–His). We found nine AMR centenarians (2.3%) who carried either the Ala-37–Thr (n 2)  or Arg-407–His (n 7) mutation, whereas only one control (0.3%) was found to be a carrier of the Arg-407–His mutation and no control carried the Ala-37–Thr mutation. These results indicate that the nonsynonymous mutations were significantly ALay more common in centenarians compared with controls (P 0.02). Of the nine centenarian carriers, IGFI levels and height were available for six carriers. When we compared the mutation achaindll nM“ carriers (n 6, 66% female) vs. noncarriers (n 163, 67% female) among centenarians, the mutation carriers had signifi- cantly higher IGFI levels (165 tly4 21 vs. 121   6 ng/ml, P   0.04) than noncarriers after adjustment for gender and age (Table 2). Although the mutation carriers were slightly shorter (162  2.8 vs. 165 Se | 0.8 cm, P   0.41) than noncarriers, this difference was not statistically significant.

Screening of the IGF1and IGF1RGenes for Mutations Associated with

Longevity. We comprehensively screened genomic DNA from a subset of female centenarians with heights below the mean for that population (n  79) and female controls (n   161) for all possible genetic variations throughout the coding exons and splice junctions of the IGF1 and IGF1R genes by using 2D gene scanning and DNA sequencing (Fig. 2). Remarkably, we did not find a single variation in the IGF1 gene, suggesting that the coding regions of this gene are highly conserved. In contrast, the IGF1R gene was highly polymorphic with a total of 20 sequence variants, among which 9 were previously unknown, novel vari- ants that were not reported in the various SNP databases (Table 1). Five SNPs of the nine novel variants were in a coding region. i>/ Interestingly, two nonsynonymous mutations, i.e., 244G A ae> (Ala-37–Thr) and 1355G A (Arg-407–His), and two novel wei> synonymous mutations, i.e., 1545G A (Thr-470–Thr) and ny thasS>T 4103C T (Arg-1323–Arg), were found in centenarians with short stature and elevated IGFI that were not seen in controls.

Severe short stature and extremely high IGFI levels were observed in a family with a mutation in the IGF1 gene, leading to an altered protein sequence associated with a de- creased affinity to the IGFIR (20). Interestingly, in our Ash- kenazi Jewish population, the coding region of the IGF1 gene was found to be remarkably free of any genetic variation, suggesting the possibility of selective pressure being exerted on this gene.

Discussion

Despite the well established role of the GH/IGF axis in modu- lation of lifespan in laboratory animals, its role in human longevity has been controversial. The identification of new nonsynonymous mutations in the IGF1R gene that result in reduced IGF signaling among centenarians suggests a similar role for this pathway in modulation of human lifespan as observed in model organisms. The centenarians with the IGF1R mutations display manifestations of elevated serum IGFI levels and a trend toward smaller height, reminiscent of the phenotypes observed in mice haploinsufficient for the IGF1R with extended lifespan (15). The centenarian mutation carriers were on average 2.5 cm shorter than nonmutation carriers, but this difference was not statistically significant (Table 2), suggesting that the impact of these mutations on height is limited, probably because of compensation via increased IGFI levels and/or other mecha- nisms. In contrast, female offspring exhibited significantly higher serum IGFI and shorter stature, possibly because of variations in other genes involved in the IGF axis that may be more common than the IGF1R mutations described here. Comprehensive anal- ysis of all genes within this axis will be required to firmly establish a role of the IGFI axis in modulation of human longevity.

In contrast, we identified a diverse set of genetic alterations in the IGF1R gene in this population. Of particular interest is the enrich- ment of the variations in the coding region, especially the nonsyn- onymous mutations in centenarians compared with the control population, suggesting a contribution of multiple rare alleles lead- ing to a major phenotypic effect on human longevity in the general population (21). So far, only a few nonsynonymous IGF1R muta- tionshavebeenreportedfrompatientswithseverephenotypessuch as intrauterine growth retardation (20, 22). The prevalence of such nonsynonymous mutations in the normal population has been obscure because of the relatively low number of control individuals  studied in previous reports (n 100). Resequencing of the IGF1R gene in the Centre d’E´tude du Polymorphisme Humain cohort indicated that the Arg-407–His variation (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/ sammiep_S pic   snp ss.cgi?subsnp id 46533818) was indeed very rare, heterozy- gocity being detected in only one individual from a total of 354 individuals. Together with our data, these results clearly demon- strate the rarity of nonsynonymous mutations among the normal population and, more importantly, its enrichment among long-lived humans.

The IGF1 gene is a strong genetic determinant of body size and serum level of IGFI across mammals (16–18). In dogs, the IGF1 promotor has been shown to be the most potent determi- nant of size (17), and IGFI levels in dogs are associated with

attenuation of IGFI-induced AKT phosphorylation in the lym- phocyte of the Arg-407–His carrier suggest that this mutation also inhibits IGFIR protein activity. Mutations in the close vicinity of this residue in IR are known to contribute to insulin-resistant diabetes (29, 30). Moreover, close to Arg-407 is the DAF-2 mutation Ala-580–Thr (e1365) that leads to dauer formation at 25°C (31). Finally, it is tempting to speculate that the altered IGF signaling induced by the synonymous mutation, waii>/ 1545G A (Thr-470–Thr), may be caused by the reduction of IGFIR levels, as demonstrated in the lymphocytes from the

ligand binding hot spots of the IGFIR extracellular domain in the L1 region (23). Our modeling using the crystal structure of the L1-CR1-L2 fragments of the IGFIR structure (24) shows that Ala-37 is positioned on a loop in the first L1 domain near residues that, when mutated, reduce the binding affinity of IGFI for IGFIR by 2- to 10-fold (Fig. 3, residues in pale pink) or aM 20-fold (Fig. 3, Phe-90 in red). A recently identified compound heterozygote missense mutation (22), Arg-108–Gln and Lys- 115–Asn, from a patient with intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation with features of IGF resistance is also located in this region of L1 (Fig. 3, residues in hot pink). These results suggest that the Ala-37–Thr change may affect ligand binding but to a lesser extent than the mutations that are within the IGF binding pocket. This region also coincides with residues 34–44 of the IR that are shown to be important for insulin binding (25). Align- ment of IGFIR with the IR shows that Ala-37 is just one residue away from IR Phe-39, a residue important for insulin ligand specificity (26). Ala-37 is also adjacent to a highly conserved stretch of residues beginning with Glu-44, which has important function for insulin/IR binding (27). Interestingly, IGFIR resi- dues around Ala-37 are highly conserved among distant verte- brate species, indicating that sequence variants most probably affect function.

Another mutation found in our screen, Arg-407–His, is lo- cated in the region of the L2 domain where nonsynonymous mutations display defective proreceptor processing and trans- port to the plasma membrane without reduction in ligand affinity (28).

centenarian carrier, possibly resulting from the allele-specific differences in mRNA splicing, processing, or translational con- trol and regulation (32).

This article provides strong evidence that the IGF1R can be a genetic determinant of human longevity. The role of GH/IGF pathway in human longevity is controversial because of the recognized evolutionary tradeoffs in the modulation of lifespan. Our findings suggest that ‘‘IGF-related longevity genes’’ do exist in human populations. Although these data suggest that such alterations occur in a low frequency in human centenarians, more exhaustive studies will clarify whether longevity assuring genetic factors and related phenotypes exist for other compo- nents of the GH/IGF pathway. Indeed, our results suggest that centenarians may harbor individually rare, but collectively more common, genetic variations in genes encoding components of the GH/IGF signaling pathway. Additional comprehensive stud- ies in the centenarians and their offspring may reveal other molecules within the GH/IGF pathway that are operative in human longevity.

Mutation Screening of IGF1 and IGF1R. We screened genomic DNA isolated from blood of centenarians and controls to discover all possible genetic variationsinthefullcodingsequenceandintron/exonboundariesoftheIGF1 and IGF1R genes by 2D gene scanning (35). To increase specificity, PCR ampli- fication was designed in two steps. First, two multiplex long-distance PCR coamplified 12 large fragments encompassing coding and splicing junction regions of IGF1 and IGF1R. These products served as template for four multi- plex short PCRs to amplify all target regions in 30 fragments (5 fragments for IGF1and25fragmentsforIGF1R).Primersarelistedinsupportinginformation (SI) Table 3.
