quantitative traits (16). Heritability estimates for telomere length vary from 35 to 80% (9, 13, 17). Although several candidate fi genes have been identi ed as potential modulators of telomere length in humans (17, 18), none of these genes seem to play a direct role in maintenance of telomere length (19). Recently, one of the most obvious candidate genes of telomere maintenance, telomerase, has been shown to play a direct role in the main- tenance of telomere length in humans (20). Telomerase is a specialized ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that adds telo- mere repeats to the ends of chromosomes and has two essential components: a catalytic component encoded by the human te- lomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and a human telome- rase RNA component (hTERC). The latter component provides the template for nucleotide addition by hTERT. Heterozygote mutations in the hTERT and hTERC genes lead to short telo- meres and are the major risk factors for rare hematopoietic disorders of bone marrow failure, including aplastic anemia and dyskeratosis congenital. These results indicate that the levels of functional telomerase are critical for telomere maintenance (21). fi Telomerase is expressed at high levels in speci c germline cells, proliferating stem-like cells, and many cancers, whereas in nor- mal adult cell types, it is either not expressed or is expressed at very low levels that are not suffi cient to maintain telomere length. However, telomerase can be unregulated in these cells under certain conditions to maintain telomere length (22). This suggests that effi cient regulation of telomerase gene expression in response to stresses that are known to reduce telomere length such as oxidative damage or infl ammation would lead to better telomere maintenance.

Telomere length in humans is emerging as a biomarker of aging because its shortening is associated with aging-related diseases and early mortality. However, genetic mechanisms responsible for these associations are not known. Here, in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, their offspring, and offspring-matched con- trols, we studied the inheritance and maintenance of telomere length and variations in two major genes associated with telo- merase enzyme activity, hTERT and hTERC. We demonstrated that centenarians and their offspring maintain longer telomeres com- pared with controls with advancing age and that longer telomeres are associated with protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function, and lipid profiles of healthy aging. Sequence analysis of hTERT and hTERC showed overrepresentation of syn- onymous and intronic mutations among centenarians relative to controls. Moreover, we identified a common hTERT haplotype that is associated with both exceptional longevity and longer telomere length. Thus, variations in human telomerase gene that are asso- ciated with better maintenance of telomere length may confer healthy aging and exceptional longevity in humans.

longevity heritability aging biomarker

Telomeres consist of the TTAGGG tandem repeats at the ends of chromosomes and are known to protect these regions from degradation and DNA repair activities (1). Telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division in cultured primary human cells (2) until a critically shortened length is achieved, upon which the cells enter replicative senescence (3). Although the relevance of replicative senescence to in vivo aging remains poorly understood, numerous reports suggest that telomere shortening may be associated with organismal aging, with con- comitant metabolic decline and increased risk for disease and death (4, 5). For example, several cross-sectional studies in hu- mans have shown that telomere length in white blood cells is – inversely related to the age of the cell donor (6 9). Likewise, shorter telomere length has been shown to be associated with age-related disease including coronary heart disease, hyper- tension, and dementia, as well as general risk factors for disease such as insulin resistance and obesity (10). Furthermore, oxida- tive stress and infl ammation, two major postulated causal factors of aging, are known to accelerate telomere shortening, suggest- ing that telomere length may be an important biomarker of aging fl because it re ects the cumulative burden of oxidative stress and fl in ammation (4, 11). In addition, most (5, 12, 13) but not all studies (14, 15) have shown a positive association between te- lomere length and overall survival in humans. These results in- dicate that telomere shortening could be used as a biomarker of disease risk and progression as well as early mortality. However, biological mechanisms responsible for these associations are not known.

We have previously shown that individuals in Ashkenazi families with exceptional longevity have generally been spared major age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, which are largely responsible for mortality in the elderly, and that these features are heritable (23). Because studies on individuals with a normal life span suggest that

Telomere length varies among individuals and families and follows the polygenic mode of inheritance pattern typical of most

– ciated with shorter telomeres (24 28), we assessed the telomere length in blood leukocytes among subjects with exceptional longevity (centenarians) to investigate if centenarians survived with long telomeres, an indicator of better telomere length fl maintenance, or short telomeres re ecting chronologically old age. In addition, in view of a strong family history of excep- tional longevity and genetic basis of telomere length main- tenance, we tested if telomere length as a trait would be inherited by the offspring of centenarians and associated with the status of aging-related diseases. Finally, to study the genetic basis of telomere length maintenance, we took a candidate gene approach to discover all possible variations in two main hTERT genes associated with telomerase enzyme activity, and hTERC , in centenarians and younger controls for genetic as- sociation analysis with human exceptional longevity and telo- mere length. Our overall hypothesis is that maintenance of telomere length may indicate generalized genomic integrity, fl which, in turn, may have a profound in uence on health and aging in humans.

Results

Telomere Length, Heritability, and Longevity. Phenotypes of tenarians, their offspring (approximate age of 70 years), offspring-matched controls without a family history of longevity, all of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, are presented Table 1. The control and offspring groups have similar fi teristics of lipid pro les, except that controls have a smaller percentage of large LDL particle size, but these fi ences are not signi cant (Table 1). The centenarian group plays a lower mean body mass index and higher HDL levels compared with controls (Table 1).

Fig. 1. Comparison of telomere length among Ashkenazi Jewish cen- tenarians (n = 86), their offspring (n = 175), and controls (n = 93). Values are adjusted for age at recruitment and gender in the offspring and control groups and for gender alone in the centenarian group. *P < 0.05.

intrafamily correlation, we used a sandwich variance estimator equation and a generalized estimating equation (GEE), re- fi spectively. Both analyses repeated our rst estimation supporting fi the observation of signi cant telomere length differences between – offspring and controls, on average, by 0.081 (95% CI: 0.022 0.139; P = 0.007) for the sandwich estimation and by 0.082 (95% CI: – P 0.017 0.147; = 0.013) for the GEE. Moreover, unlike controls, offspring of centenarians do not show an appreciable decline in telomere length with age as compared with controls (Fig. 1). However, the difference in age-related decline did not differ sig- fi ni cantly between offspring and controls (adjusted mean differ- − P ence = 0.002, 95% CI: 0.007 to +0.010; = 0.682) by the same hierarchical linear model described earlier. High heritability P (86%; = 0.005) for telomere length between centenarians and their offspring was observed, suggesting that telomere length has a strong genetic component in families with exceptional longevity

When controls and centenarians are combined to represent cross-sectional age groups of unrelated individuals from middle – age to oldest old (range: 43 105 years), telomere length declines with age until the age of 85 years (Fig. 1). However, individuals older than 86 years of age as well as the centenarians show longer telomere lengths compared with unrelated individuals younger P than 85 years of age, with a mean difference of 0.17 ( = 0.04) in the linear regression model adjusting for age and gender. The telomere length of offspring exceeds that of controls in a hier- fi archical linear model, on average by 0.082 [95% con dence in- terval (CI): 0.017– 0.148; P = 0.014]. Because centenarians and their offspring are appreciable singleton families, we used the re- gression approach for nonindependencies of the observed sub- jects. To account for parametric model bias as well as for unknown

sequence variants in the gene, among which 5 were previously unknown unique variants that were not reported in various SNP databases (Table 3). The locations of these variants are shown in Fig. 4. Nine variants in the hTERT gene are in the coding region, including two nonsynonymous variants, 893 G > A (Ala-279 Thr) and 3242 G > A (Ala-1062 Thr), which are rare and found only in controls (Table 3). In silico analysis using SIFT (sorts intolerant from tolerant substitutions) (30) and PolyPhen (31), which predict the effects of amino acid changes on protein function, indicates that these changes are likely to be benign. Interestingly, rare synonymous or intronic variants in hTERT are enriched in centenarians (n = 19) compared with controls (n = 3) (Table 2; P = 0.041). In addition, three previously un- described intronic variants in hTERC were also found, two of which were rare and found only in centenarians (Table 3).

Telomere Length, Age-Associated Diseases, and Lipid Profiles of

Healthy Aging. Association analysis between telomere and major age-related diseases among centenarians, their fi spring, and controls indicated that signi cantly shorter mere lengths (adjusted for age, gender, and group) are P in subjects with hypertension ( = 0.006), the metabolic P P drome ( = 0.03), or diabetes ( = 0.03) compared with without these disorders (Fig. 2). Moreover, when we tested relation between telomere length and cognitive function centenarians, centenarians with impaired cognitive [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤ 25] fi signi cantly shorter telomeres as compared with with normal cognitive function after adjustment for age gender (Fig. 2; P = 0.02). We then tested whether fi length correlated with the lipid pro les, which are known dictors of aging-related diseases such as coronary artery and metabolic syndromes (29). These analyses revealed telomere length is associated with the lipid profi les of aging, showing a positive association with increased sizes of LDL (P = 0.0001) and HDL (P = 0.03), percentage large particle sizes of LDL (P = 0.0002) and HDL (P = and levels of Apo-A1 (P = 0.005) and HDL (P = 0.04) (Table whereas there is a negative association with very LDL (P = 0.008). Total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and levels show no signifi cant correlation (Table 2). These suggest that longer telomeres are positively correlated with lipid profi les of healthy aging.

We genotyped the four common hTERT variants, with a minor allelefrequency (MAF)of> 5%[IVS1– 187T> C,973G> A(Ala- > > 305 Ala), 3097 C T (His-1013 His), IVS16+99 C T], in 73 centenarians and 49 controls. Information on telomere length was fi available for all these individuals. We did not nd an association of the IVS1– 187 T > C, 973 G > A (Ala-305 Ala), and IVS16+99 C > fi T with longevity. However, signi cant associations were detected with the 3097 C > T (His-1013 His) variant: the T allele is sig- nifi cantly enriched in centenarians (21.8%) compared with con- trols (8.2%; P = 0.026) (Table 3), and both CT and TT genotypes fi are signi cantly enriched in centenarians compared with controls (26.8%and8.5%vs.12.2%and2%,respectively;P =0.035)(Table 4). In contrast, no signifi cant association between the hTERC > common variant (IVS+63 T C) and longevity was found (Table 4). Haplotype analysis [see SI Fig. S1 for a linkage disequilibrium (LD)plot derived from the four commonvariants] revealedthat of fi the four most common haplotypes, Hap 1 is signi cantly depleted in centenarians compared with controls (34.9% vs. 53.1%; P = 0.0056), whereas Hap 3 is signifi cantly enriched in centenarians compared with controls (13.7% vs. 8.2%; P = 0.007) when adjusted for age and gender (Table 5). Interestingly, a rare haplotype in fi controls, Hap 6, is found signi cantly more frequently in cen- P tenarians (1% vs. 6.8%; = 0.024) (Table 5). Association analysis

netically controlled longevity traits. This approach has previously fi led to the identi cation of longevity phenotypes such as lip- oprotein sizes and the subsequent discovery of corresponding longevity genotypes (32– 34). In the present investigation, we employed the same study design to delineate the relation be- tween telomere lengths, longevity, and diseases of aging as well as to gain insights into the potential role(s) of genetic variations in the hTERT and hTERC genes on these phenotypes.

have signifi cantly longer telomeres than unrelated controls and that this trait is strongly heritable. Moreover, we have demon- strated that offspring of centenarians do not show an appreciable age-related decline in telomere length as is observed in our un- related control population as well as in other cross-sectional < studies (5). Because telomere length in younger persons ( 75 fi years of age) is not signi cantly different between offspring of centenarians and unrelated controls, these results suggest that families with exceptional longevity have superior telomere length maintenance. Interestingly, unrelated controls older than 86 years of age exhibit longer telomeres than younger individuals (controls), suggesting that the rate of telomere attrition may be an important determinant of overall survival in the general population. The relatively older group may be affected by sur- vival bias that selected out individuals with aging-related disease or those who would have died before reaching the age of 85 years, leaving the survivors with relatively longer telomeres.

Telomere length was adjusted for group, gender, and age at recruitment.

hTERT hTERC of common or variants with telomere length in- fi dicates no signi cant association (Table S1). However, of the two haplotypes that are enriched in centenarians compared with controls, Hap 3 shows a positive association with telomere length P after adjusting for age and gender ( = 0.007), whereas Hap 6 fi P does not reach a signi cant threshold ( =0.59)becauseof itslow frequencies in the tested population (Table 6). In contrast, a centenarian-depleted haplotype, Hap 1, shows no association with telomere length (Table 5).

Because shorter telomere length is associated with diseases of aging, including hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, and dementia (10), we studied the association between telomere length, major age-related diseases, and lipid profi les in cen- tenarians, their offspring, and controls. Lipid profi les are known predictors of age-related diseases, and we have previously demonstrated that centenarians and their offspring have sig- nifi cantly larger HDL and LDL particle sizes and that these are heritable phenotypes of healthy aging associated with a lower prevalence of morbidity. We found that longer telomeres are indeed associated with lower prevalence of hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and better cognitive func- fi tion as well as with healthier lipid pro les.

Discussion

Several studies have demonstrated a close relation between telomere length and life span in humans, including long-lived humans (4). However, interpretations of results from these studies are often confounded because of a lack of adequate controls. We employed a unique study design to overcome this shortcoming in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with exceptional longevity (centenarians), their offspring (approx- imate age of 70 years), and age- and gender-matched controls without a family history of unusual longevity. The use of off- spring of individuals with exceptional longevity and their matched controls provides a powerful approach to identify ge-

Telomere length, as a quantitative trait, is fairly well studied fl (19), but genetic factors that in uence it are not well understood. hTERT Recent studies suggest that heterozygote mutation in hTERC and genes, which are the essential components of telo- merase, show defective phenotypes in several diseases, indicating that half the usual dose of telomerase is inadequate for main- tenance of telomeres with normal length (35, 36). Because living to 100 years of age is a rare phenotype in humans, with a prev- alence of 1 in 10,000 individuals in the general population (37), we hypothesized that centenarians may harbor rare gain-of- fl function mutations in the telomerase genes that may also in u-

fi functional effects. In addition, although we did not nd a single hTERC coding variation in the gene, we found two rare intronic variants only in centenarians. The enrichment of both synon- ymous and intronic variants of hTERT and hTERC genes in centenarians is intriguing because these variants are known to play a functional role in the regulation of gene expression through modulation of mRNA stability, mRNA secondary fi structure, alternative splicing, or translational ef ciency (39, 40).

Our study also revealed that common fl genetic variations in hTERT may in uence the telomere length maintenance associated with longer telomeres in families with exceptional longevity.

The expression level of hTERT is a major determinant of telomerase activity (41). Recent studies indicate that telomer- ase activation can be regulated by environmental interventions such as lifestyle changes or stress management (42). There are fl functional hTERT promoter variants known to in uence telo- merase expression and telomere length (43). However, because hTERT there is very little LD in the gene, it is not likely that the centenarian-enriched rare variants are proxies of functional hTERT variants in the promoter. It is tempting to speculate fl hTERT that the rare variants might in uence expression of in response to environmental stresses such as infl ammation or oxidative stress, which then promotes better maintenance of telomere length. Indeed, mean telomere length is much greater among the carriers of the rare variant compared with the

These common variants hTERT may contribute to the regulation of gene expression. A hTERT common intronic variant shown to be associated with susceptibility to IPF may also affect the expression levels of hTERT (44). Taken together, our study demonstrates that cen- tenarians may harbor individually rare but collectively more common genetic variations in genes involved in the telomere maintenance pathway, implicating a role of regulatory variants in

Primers for telomeres and the single-copy gene HGB (β-globin gene) were added to final concen- trations of 0.1 μM per 0.9 μM and 0.3 μM per 0.7 μM, respectively. The primer sequences are TEL 1b, 5′-CGGTTTGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTT-TGGGTTT- GGGTT-3′; TEL 2b, 5′-GGCTTGCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTT-ACCCT-3′; HGB1, 5′-GCTTCTGACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC-3′; and HGB2, 5′-CACCAACTT- CATCCACGTTC-ACC-3′ (48). The enzyme was activated at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, 58°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 40 s for the HGB reaction or for 20 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, 56°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 60 s for the telomere reaction. All transition rates were set to 20°C/s with the ex- ception of the annealing transition rate in the telomere reaction, which was set to 4°C/s. Forty samples (mixed samples from probands, offspring, and controls) were analyzed by qPCR, both in our laboratory and by one of the authors (R.M.C.) for validation purposes, yielding a correlation of 0.89 (P < 0.001). In addition, to ensure reproducibility, when measuring previously un- analyzed samples, and to account for assay variability between batches, we used an anchor sample that was previously measured. The reproducibility between the two measurements was high (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). Results ob- tained using this qPCR were highly correlated with those obtained by the traditional terminal restriction fragment length approaches (48). One T/S ratio unit is equivalent to a mean telomere length of 4,270 bp in the leukocytes. The qPCR telomere length determination does not include subtelo- meric lengths.

the telomerase gene in human longevity and maintenance of telomere length.

In summary, we provide strong correlative evidence that individuals in Ashkenazi Jewish families with exceptional lon- gevity have better maintenance of telomere length and that the telomerase genes may function as important genetic determi- nants of both human longevity and telomere length. Addition- ally, our data suggest that both telomere length and variants of fl telomerase genes may have a cumulative in uence on lower fi disease prevalence and a favorable lipid pro le in centenarians and their offspring. Additional comprehensive studies on genetic and genomic variation of centenarians and their offspring com- prising candidate genes, especially those known to play a role in telomere maintenance in model organisms, may reveal pre- viously undescribed genomic regions and molecules that are operative in human health and longevity.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Subjects. A cohort of Ashkenazi Jews with exceptional lon- gevitywasrecruitedaspreviouslydescribed(34).Probandswererequiredtobe living independently at 95 years of age as a reflection of good health, al- thoughatthetimeofrecruitment,theycouldbeatanylevelofdependency.In addition, probands had to have a first-degree offspring who was willing to participate in the study. Birth certificates or dates of birth as stated on pass- ports were used to verify the participants’ ages. The Ashkenazi population is descended from a founder population (estimated to be several thousands) originatinginthe15thcentury.This“foundereffect”resultedinapopulation both culturally and genetically homogeneous, from which several disease- related genes have been successfully identified (45). A majority of these in- dividuals were born in the United States or moved there before World War II. Telomere measurements (see below) were made on 86 Ashkenazi probands (aged 97.4± 0.3years) defined ashaving exceptional longevity,175 offspring of parents with exceptional longevity (aged 67.8 ± 0.6 years), and 93 controls who were offspring of parents with usual survival (aged 71.8 ± 1 years). By definition, parents of controls survived to the age of 85 years or less. The control group consisted largely of spouses of the offspring group.

Mutation Screening and Genotyping of hTERT and hTERC. We sequenced genomicDNAisolatedfrombloodofcentenariansandcontrolstodiscoverall possible genetic variations in the exonic regions and intron–exon boundaries of the telomerase genes (hTERT and hTERC) by a 2D gene scanning (TDGS) method (49). To increase specificity, PCR amplification was designed in two steps. To begin with, triple-multiplex long-distance PCR coamplifies eight large fragments encompassing the coding and splicing junction regions of hTERT and hTERC. These products serve as a template for quadruple-multi- plex short PCRs to amplify target regions in 18 fragments; 16 fragments for hTERT and two fragments for hTERC. Primers are listed in Table S2. The mixture of amplicons after heteroduplexing was separated on the basis of size and melting temperature in a 2D gel. Then, DNA fragments containing heterozygous sequence variation were reamplified from the genomic DNA and sequenced to identify the position and nature of sequence variation. For hTERT, exon 1 was analyzed by nucleotide sequencing and exons 2, 4, and 5 were separately analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) because of ambiguous melting patterns on a TDGS gel. Genotypes of the common variants in the telomerase gene were determined by DGGE using the same primers designed for the TDGS assay.

For each subject, a detailed medical history, physical examination, and blood sample collection were performed as previously described (23, 32, 34). The presence of hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, and diabetes was determined using National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria (46). Scores on the MMSE (47) ≤25 were considered to indicate impaired cognitive function. Triglyceride, LDL- cholesterol (LDL), and HDL-cholesterol (HDL) levels and average particle sizes were determined by NMR spectroscopy at LipoScience, Inc., as previously described (34). Large lipoprotein particle sizes were defined as >8.9 nm for HDL and >21.3 nm for LDL.

Statistical Analyses. Two comparisons have been established: (i) between probands and controls for whom crude data were adjusted for gender and (ii) between offspring and controls for whom crude data were adjusted for age and gender. Individual phenotypes that were not normally distributed were log natural-transformed for analysis and back-transformed for the current presentation. Associations of telomere length with other variables were estimated using regression on an indicator variable for group, age, and gender. In defining strata for age, cutoff points of 65, 75, 85, 95, and 105 years were used (Fig. 1). Telomere length distribution in probands appears to be nonnormally distributed; thus, to test for statistical significance, we applied nonparametric statistics analysis, and pairwise crude comparisons of telomeres between the study groups were carried out using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood methods. The significance of the parameter (association) was evaluated using the likelihood ratio test by comparing the model in which the

Measuring/Estimating Length by Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Genomic was extracted from blood samples and stored at −80°C. The average triplicate) telomere length in leukocytes was estimated using a PCR (qPCR) method (48). This approach provides relative average lengths in genomic DNA by determining the T/S ratio in experimental ples relative to a reference sample. Briefly, standard curves were for telomere lengths and for the single-gene copy amplification from a reference DNA sample that was serially diluted with water by 1.68-fold per dilution to produce 5 concentrations of DNA from 7.7 to 61 ng/μL. For analysis of subjects’ DNA, triplicate PCR

lotypes were constructed using the PHASE algorithm (50). The haplotype trend regression analysis for logistical (case-control), linear (telomere length), and proportional hazard with telomere length was performed using JMP genomics 4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).

parameter is set to 0 with the model in which the parameter is estimated. In addition, we compared telomere length between offspring and controls using a hierarchical linear regression model to account for clustering within families. The regression equation adjusted for age and gender included an indicator variable distinguishing offspring from controls and an offspring vs. controls × age interaction term. We tested the hypotheses that offspring have higher mean telomere length than controls and that the age-related decline in telomere length is less in offspring than in controls. To determine the effect of lipid profile on telomere length, a general linear model ad- justed for group, gender, and age at recruitment was used. Correlations of telomere length and lipid profile adjusted for group, gender, and age at recruitment were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Heritability of telomere length was assessed in two ways: First, it was com- puted in the ASSOC module of SAGE (v6.0.1) (http://darwin.cwru.edu/sage/). Second, narrow sense heritability was estimated from the slope of the linear regression of the traits of each parent on the mean value of the offspring group (16). Data are expressed as mean (SE) as appropriate. Statistical
