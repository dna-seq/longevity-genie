Abstract

Long-living individuals (LLIs) are used to study exceptional longevity. A number of genetic variants have been found associated in LLIs to date, but further identification of variants would improve knowledge on the mechanisms regulating the rate of aging. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study on 410 LLIs and 553 young control individuals with a 317K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to identify novel traits associated with aging. Among the top ( p < 1(cid:2)10(cid:3)4 ) SNPs initially identified, we found rs10491334 (CAMKIV) (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–0.73; p ¼ 2.88(cid:2)10(cid:3)5 ), a variant previously reported associated with diastolic blood pressure, associated also in a replication set of 116 LLIs and 160 controls (OR ¼ 0.54; 95% CI 0.32–0.90; p ¼ 9(cid:2)10(cid:3)3 ). Furthermore, in vitro analysis established that calcium/calmodulin- dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) activates the survival proteins AKT, SIRT1, and FOXO3A, and we found that homozygous carriers of rs10491334 have a significant reduction in CAMKIV expression. This, to- gether with the observed reduction in minor-allele carriers among centenarians, points to a detrimental role for the SNP. In conclusion, prolongevity genes are activated by CAMKIV, the levels of which are influenced by rs10491334, a SNP associated with human longevity.

Introduction

APOE is involved in lipid transport to the lymphatic system; its gene was the first to be successfully replicated as one important in exceptional longevity.12 FOXO3A medi- ates a prosurvival activity by regulating the cellular re- sponse to stimuli ranging from radical stress to growth factors (insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1]) and by acting on the transcription of genes involved in radical stress re- sponse, cell cycle arrest, proliferation, and apoptosis.13,14 Protein kinase B (AKT)-dependent phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-dependent deacetylation of FOXO3A in- duce prosurvival activity by activating genes linked to the stress response and to cell cycle arrest and by inhibiting proapoptotic genes.15 In humans, genetic alterations of the IGF-1 receptor that alter the IGF signaling pathway confer an increase in propensity for longevity.16 Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of AKT have also been associated with human longevity.11

(LLIs), that is, those that ap- proach 100 years of age, are a model of successful aging. Most of them have a compression of disability and morbidity toward the end of their life and tend not to show changes normally observed during aging, such as decreases in insulin sensitivity and in heart rate variability (HRV).1–3 The ex- ceptional longevity of LLIs is to some extent genetically driven, as underlined by the familial clustering effect for extreme longevity and the reduced mortality of centenarians’ siblings compared to those of noncentenarians.4,5 To date, the most remarkable genetic findings for exceptional lon- gevity observed in the genome of centenarians are the de- creased frequency of detrimental alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and the increase of protective alleles of forkhead box

estimated using the confidence intervals rule. Haplotype phases were inferred using the default expectation maximi- zation (EM) algorithm.

The identification and the study of genetic variants that influence exceptional longevity in humans are important because novel targets for prevention and therapy of a large spectrum of age-related diseases could be discovered.17 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are hypothesis- generating studies that can be used to this end. We have performed a GWAS to identify SNPs that are highly associ- ated with exceptional longevity in LLIs enrolled in the Southern Italian Centenarian Study (SICS).9

Power calculation

We performed power calculations using QUANTO soft- ware23 applying the following settings: (1) Longevity prev- alence in the general population &0.0001; (2) allele frequency ranging from 0.05 to 0.95; (3) significance threshold for the screening analysis set to p<1(cid:2)10(cid:3)4, evaluating allelic, dominant, and recessive genetic models.

Methods

SICS collection

Choice of the significance threshold

We recruited and phenotyped 582 LLIs (age range 90–109 years) and 784 young control individuals (age range 18–45 years) as part of the SICS. SICS LLIs were thoroughly in- vestigated for demographic characteristics, medical history (past and present diseases), level of independence (Barthel Score),18 and cognitive status (Cognitive Score) (Supple- mentary Table 1)(Supplementary Data can be accessed at) SICS subjects were enrolled by Associazione Longevita`.9,19 All subjects donated blood samples for DNA study and gave written informed consent to the study, which was approved by Ethical Committee. The study was conducted in accor- dance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The significance threshold applied was selected by esti- mating the false-positive fraction for different significance thresholds P on simulated datasets. Data simulation was carried out by generating 100 independent datasets com- posed by 317K SNPs, with MAF distribution ranging from 0.05 to 0.50, and 963 control samples to which 410 ‘‘case’’ and 553 ‘‘control’’ labels were assigned randomly. We then tested for association between each marker and the case/control status assuming allelic, dominant, and recessive genetic models and selecting the most significant as the most infor- mative for each SNP. For each significance threshold (from p value 0.05 to p< 1(cid:2)10(cid:3)7) the mean fraction of false positive associations (a false positive association was defined as a SNP with p lower than the selected significance threshold P) was estimated over 100 simulated datasets for each P.

Determination of genotypes

Genotyping was carried out with the Infinium II Assay- HumanHap BeadChip 317K duo system (Illumina, San Diego, California) using standard protocols of the Illumina HumanHap 317 Duo workflow (Illumina, San Diego, CA). All genotypes were evaluated using a quantitative quality score called GenCall (GC) score. The GC score ranges from 0 to 1 and reflects the proximity within a cluster plot of the intensities of that genotype to the centroid of the nearest cluster.

Testing for association

Association between the set of SNPs passing the QC cri- teria and the longevity phenotype was tested by means of the one degree of freedom (df) Pearson chi-squared allelic association test (a [minor allele] vs. A [major allele]) and assuming a dominant (aa/aA vs. AA, 1 df) and recessive genetic effect (aa vs. aA/AA, 1 df).

Logistic regression assuming additive, dominant, and re- cessive genetic models was applied to estimate odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each of the dif- ferent genetic models, to test for association in the replication set, and to evaluate potentially confounding gender-specific effects. Adjustment for potential confounding effects due to residual genetic stratification was done with the genomic control approach.24

Quality control analyses

Samples and SNPs with a Call Rate lower than, respec- tively, 93% and 95%, as well as SNPs deviating from Hardy– Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) ( p<1.72(cid:2)10(cid:3)7) or with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05 were re- moved. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on a reduced set of autosomal markers showing r2 estimates <0.2, using the default outliers removal threshold (sig- ma ¼6) as implemented in Eigenstrat software.20

All statistical procedures were performed using PLINK,25 except when specified.

In vitro evaluation of CAMKIV

Imputation of unobserved genotypes

Cell cultures. Human colon adenocarcinoma grade II HT29 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media were supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. The cells were seeded at 2(cid:2)106 cells/mL and infected with the appropriate lentivirus. Ex- pression of CAMKIV-WT was confirmed by western blot using a specific antibody against CAMKIV.

SNPs that were not represented on the Illumina Infinium II Assay-HumanHap BeadChip 317K were imputed by the Impute v2.1.2 software,21 using the 1,000 Genomes files from CEU (Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain [CEPH] [Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe]) genotypes data (release March 2010) as reference panel.

Linkage disequilibrium analyses

Mononuclear cells. Blood was collected and antic- oagulated with EDTA. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll gradient using HISTOPAQUE-1077 (Sigma, USA),

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses were performed using Haploview v4.2 software.22 Haplotype blocks were

frozen, and stored at (cid:3)808C until the day of the assay. All procedures were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines for human research.26 Mononuclear cells were chosen on the basis of the previous knowledge that CAMKIV is expressed in these cells and on the assumption that a ge- notype/expression correlation is not tissue specific, thus re- flecting expression modification in all tissues that express CAMKIV.

tested with the low thresholds of significance that must be adopted.29 For this reason, even replicated associations such as FOXO3A and APOE can be missed if formal Bonferroni correction (that is, a correction of the significance of the p value on the basis of the number of tests performed) is ap- plied when analyzing these loci in a whole-genome context. In an attempt to generate a list of SNPs potentially associated with human longevity, we decided to screen SICS LLIs and controls. We genotyped these subjects with the Infinium II Assay-HumanHap 317K duo BeadChip (Illumina, San Die- go, CA), evaluating allelic, dominant, and recessive genetic association models.

Lentiviral infection. The lentiviral constructs were gen- erated and characterized by Kitsos et al.27 Briefly, CAMKIV- WT cDNA was cloned into a Lenti-IRES-GFP vector, and high-titer control and recombinant viruses were prepared by pseudotyping with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) using a quadruple transfection protocol in 293T cells.28 Approximately 2(cid:2)106 HT29cells were infected with the appropriate lentivirus: CAMKIV-WT (CAMKIV) or empty lentivirus (mock) as a control.

The initial screening dataset was composed of 466 LLIs, 624 controls, and 318,237 SNPs. After a preliminary phase of QC, as described in the Methods section, we looked for ev- idence of genetic population stratification on a subset of 454 LLIs and 591 young controls by applying PCA20: a graphical inspection of the first two principal components revealed genetic homogeneity between LLIs and controls (Fig. 1).

Western blotting

After outliers were removed (n ¼82), the final GWAS dataset was composed of 963 samples, of which 410 were cases (age range, 90–109 years; male/female ratio, 1.47; see Supplementary Table 1 for a detailed demographic and clinical characterization of SICS LLIs9) and 553 were controls (age range, 18–48 years; male/female ratio, 1.56). A total of 298,715 SNPs passed the overall QC criteria.

For western blot analysis, mouse and rabbit monoclonal antibodies to SIRT1 and anti-phospho-SIRT1 were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Polyclonal antibodies to FOXO3A, phospho- FOXO3A (Ser253), AKT, and pospho- AKT (Ser473) were purchased from Cell Signaling technol- ogy. Monoclonal CAMKIV antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). One-way analysis of vari- ance (ANOVA) was performed to compare different groups using Bonferroni post hoc analysis. A significance level of p <0.05 was assumed for all statistical evaluations. Statistics were computed with GraphPad Prism Software (San Diego, California). Each value in the figures represents mean (cid:4)standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent experiments.

We then tested for association between each of the iden- tified SNPs and longevity phenotype. Inspection of the quantile–quantile plots (Supplementary Fig. 1) and the esti- mated genomic inflation factor (l)24 for the different genetic models revealed a moderate residual effect of population stratification on the association results (allelic l, 1.09; domi- nant l, 1.07; recessive l, 1.00). Therefore, we decided to re- move this potential confounding factor by genomic control adjustment.24

Results

Simulations results (see Methods) showed that the rate of false-positive findings was a function of the significance in- clusion cutoff, suggesting that the choice of p <1(cid:2)10(cid:3)4 for at least one of the evaluated genetic models as the significance would guarantee a false-positive rate of approximately 2 in 10,000 independent tests (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Association study

Although GWAS do not rely on choosing the right gene beforehand, they do require a large sample size to support with adequate power the hundreds of thousand of SNPs

Univariate chi-squared-based association tests identified 67 SNPs showing genomic control adjusted p< 1(cid:2)10(cid:3)4 (Ta- ble 1). Many of these SNPs mapped to the genes of proteins potentially relevant to the aging process (Table 1, Supple- mentary Table 2, Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4); for example, potassium voltage-gated channel, subfamily H (age related), member 1 gene (KCNH1), also known as EAG1 or K(V)10.1, is an important regulator of cell proliferation under the control of IGF-1 signaling.30 None of these associations was signifi- cantly influenced by gender-confounding effects or by po- tential gender-specific associations (Supplementary Table 3).

The rs10491334 SNP was further tested for association in an independent replication set (SICSr) composed of 116 SICS LLIs (age range, 90–109 years; male/female ratio, 0.87; see Supplementary Table 1 for a detailed demographic and clinical characterization of SICS LLIs9) and 160 young con- trols (age range, 18–44 years; male/female ratio, 1.91) pass- ing the overall QC procedure. Power calculations using QUANTO software23 showed that we had intermediate power in both screening (70%) and replication (60%) steps with the sample sizes used and OR and frequency of rs10491334 (Supplementary Table 5). Association results on the SICSr cohort and the joint analysis of the screening and replication sets (516 LLIs vs. 713 controls) confirmed the association of rs10491334 (replication, OR¼ 0.54, 95% CI 0.32–0.90, p¼9(cid:2)10(cid:3)3; joint analysis, OR ¼0.55, 95% CI 0.43– 0.70, p¼1.68(cid:2)10(cid:3)6) (Table 2).

We reviewed the Disease Associated Catalog to determine whether any of our 67 selected SNPs had been previously associated with traits relevant to aging. We found that rs10491334 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV [CAMKIV]) had been associated with high diastolic blood pressure in the Framingham Study (p ¼4.47(cid:2)10(cid:3)6).31 Asso- ciation tests on imputed SNPs confirmed rs10491334 with the strongest evidence of association within the CAMKIV locus (Supplementary Figure 5).

Association results were not influenced by gender- confounding effects (Supplementary Table 3). To be noted, we found a significant association for rs2075650 (TOMM40) (p< 0.05), a SNP inpartial LD with the APOe4 haplotype32that shows very low MAF (overall MAF of 0.05), in line with the observation that, among Europeans, relative APOE e4 fre- quencies exhibit a north-to-south cline.33 Furthermore, inde- pendent genetic analyses on the same population showed

To be noted, imputation analysis was explorative, subse- quent to the association analysis for rs10491334 and was done with the only purpose of understanding whether the signal detected at rs10491334 could have been explained by other nearby SNPs.

lation.35 Therefore, the activation of AKT, FOXO3A, and SIRT1 reduces the activation of proapoptotic genes and favors cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress resistance.15 On the basis of this premise, we first investigated whether rs10491334 affected the protein expression of calcium/calmodulin-de- pendent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV). To this end, we used mononuclear cells of healthy controls carrying the polymor- phism in homozygosis (n¼ 10) and compared them to those from individuals carrying the wild-type gene (n¼10). We found that the protein level of CAMKIV is significantly lower in homozygous carriers (Fig. 2A). The reduction in CAMKIV protein expression driven by the polymorphism, together with

CAMKIV and functional studies

Under growth factor stimulation, FOXO3A is phosphory- lated by AKT and binds to 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm. Thus, it becomes unable to activate proapoptotic genes, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS).34 When oxidative stress induces transloca- tion of FOXO3A to the nucleus, its ability to activate proapoptotic genes is reduced by SIRT1-dependent deacety-

the higher frequency of wild-type CAMKIV genotypes de- tected among LLIs, supports a prosurvival role for CAMKIV.

CAMKIV is activated by and is a key component of the cAMP signaling cascade that induces CREB-dependent transcription modulating synaptic plasticity and nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced sympathetic neuron survival.45,46 Fur- thermore, the innate response to Gram-negative lipopolysac- charides induces dendritic cell survival triggered by increased CAMKIV-mediated expression of antiapoptotic B cell lym- phoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein.47 Moreover, CAMKIV was previously linked to aging in a transcriptional profiling study conducted on aging cortex in mice, rhesus macaques, and humans. The greatest conserved change was age-dependent down- regulation of CAMKIV, indicating a potential involvement of CAMKIV in age-related decline of synaptic function.48

tected among LLIs, supports a prosurvival role for CAMKIV. Then, we tested whether CAMKIV could induce phosphor- ylation of SIRT1 (at Ser47), AKT (at Ser473), and FOXO3A (at Ser253). To this end, we expressed wild-type CAMKIV in HT29 cells, a cell line that does not express CAMKIV, with the use of a lentiviral vector. We found that CAMKIV induces phosphory- lation of the three prosurvival proteins, thus proposing CAM- KIV as a key regulator of survival genes (Fig. 2B,C).

Discussion

Longevity genes can be discovered by genetic association studies conducted on LLIs. This type of study identifies gene variants that have been selected by demographic pressure and, therefore, that are in some way significant for human health. The identification of these gene variants is important in that they could represent potential targets for fighting aging-associated illness.

Here, we report an association between the presence of wild-type CAMKIV and the propensity for exceptional lon- gevity, and a correlation between the presence of the rs10491334 variant of CAMKIV and the reduction of CAM- KIV protein expression in mononuclear cells. We demon- strate, moreover, that CAMKIV is important in the activation of the prosurvival proteins analyzed, namely AKT, SIRT1, and FOXO3A. Therefore, the abundance of native CAMKIV protein probably has a role in slowing the aging process, in addition to CAMKIV’s known crucial role in osteoclasto- genesis, long-term memory, and neuron survival.46,49,50

Many genes capable of regulating aging in lower eu- karyotes and, more recently, in mammals have been identi- fied to date.17 Of these, only APOE and FOXO3A have been consistently replicated across populations, even if some of the population-specific genetic findings have been function- ally validated, such as Klotho and IGF-1 receptor genes.16,36 Therefore it is plausible that population-specific environmental conditions do not exercise similar demographic pressures across populations, with consequently inconsistent results.

We replicated the genetic finding in an independent set of LLIs and controls, thus strengthening our evidence of asso- ciation. However, a limitation of our study is the small population sample size used for replication that reached a 60% power to replicate rs10491334 and the male/female ratio that did not overlap with the ratio of the screening set, even if no gender effect was observed by regression analysis in the original association. Nonetheless, the functional validation of CAMKIV, demonstrating the ability of CAMKIV to regulate the key aging proteins SIRT1, AKT, and FOXO3A, is a strength of the study.

The use of younger populations as controls exposes studies to potential bias due to the comparison of two pop- ulations that belong to different generations and, possibly, to different genetic backgrounds caused by recent immigration. This was excluded by analysis of genetic structure.

The fine-tuning of key genes allows the cell to fight the accumulation of radical oxygen species and genotoxic mol- ecules, and to regulate the balance between proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The expression of these genes is triggered by oxidative stress, growth factors, nutrients, and chronic stresses, such as caloric restriction and endurance training. For example, the phenols resveratrol and n-tyrosol, contained in red and white wine, respectively, promote cell survival through the activation of SIRT1, AKT, and FOXO3A.15 SIRT1 is activated by the low-energy sensor adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is activated in turn by caloric restriction.37 AMPK also induces endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), responsible for cardioprotection.38,39 Interestingly, despite the strong evidence in favor of a prosurvival role for SIRT1, none of the genetic variants of this gene, or of its homolog sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), have been associated with longevity.40,41 Therefore it is possible that genes that regulate SIRT1, rather than SIRT1 itself, are under demographic pressure and, hence, better targets to delay aging.

In conclusion, we have: (1) Generated a list of SNP candi- dates linked to longevity in a GWAS conducted on a south Italian population; (2) provided evidence that the longevity- associated rs10491334 variant of CAMKIV negatively influ- ences CAMKIV protein expression; and (3) provided evidence suggesting a prolongevity role of native CAMKIV through the activation of AKT, SIRT1, and FOXO3A proteins.
