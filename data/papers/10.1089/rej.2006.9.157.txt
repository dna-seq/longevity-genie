Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, regulating type and intensity of the immune re- sponse, might influence life expectancy. In previous case-control studies the authors have demonstrated that both HLA-DR and -DQ alleles are not associated with longevity in the Sar- dinian population. On the other hand, association studies are subjected (as part of the ho- mogeneity of the population in terms of geographic origin) to a number of possible con- founding factors. Therefore, the authors typed the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles in 24 sibs (age range 85 to 97) of 17 centenarians by PCR-SSP. Sib pair analysis showed non- significant differences between the observed and expected percentage of DQA* or DQB1* al- lele sharing. Therefore, these data strengthen the view that class II HLA genes have a mar- ginal effect, if any, on the complex longevity trait.

type, although other studies do not confirm these observations.3,4 More recently, the au- thors evaluated HLA-DRB1 frequency in Sar- dinian centenarians and controls, and showed that HLA-DRB1*15 was increased in centenar- ians, although it was no more significant after Bonferroni’s correction.5 Indeed, association studies are subjected to a number of possible confounding factors, such as the homogeneity of the population in terms of geographic ori- gin.3 Selection of a very homogeneous popula- tion might allow one to overcome some con- founding biases. In this regard, the Sardinian

T on the HE INFLUENCE OF GENETIC FACTORS variation in life expectancy might be esti- mated to be approximately 25%,1 and a num- ber of studies have suggested that genetic de- terminants of longevity might at least partially reside in the polymorphisms for genes that regulate immune responses as human leuko- cyte antigen (HLA) genes.2 Some well-planned and -designed association studies performed in whites suggest that longevity is associated with the HLA-DR11 allele or HLA-B8,DR3 haplo-

HLA-DQ typing

population is an ancient genetic isolate, the ge- netic pool of which is characterized by rela- tively little genetic flow from the different pop- ulations that have invaded the island during the last 3000 years.6 On the other hand, the HLA region contains a remarkable number of genes forming some very stable haplotypes, characterized by a strong linkage disequilib- rium, and probably conferring a selection ad- vantage.7 Some of the highly conserved haplo- types are composed by the HLA-DR,DQ alleles and, in some instances, HLA-DQ alleles seem to play a central role in association with dis- eases.8,9 This study evaluated the effect of HLA-DQ alleles in determining a longevity trait. The analysis of affected sib pairs was ap- plied to 24 Sardinian centenarian-sib (85- to 99- year-old) pairs. This strategy, indeed, is an al- ternative powerful tool, allowing the authors to analyze the influence of genetic variants in- volved in complex phenotypes on ancestry and environmental influences independently.10

Blood specimens were collected in tripotas- sium EDTA sterile tubes and genomic DNA   was extracted and stored at 20°C for the dif- ferent genetic analyses. DNA samples for HLA- DQ typing were available from 123 centenari- ans (83 women and 40 men), 92 controls (58 women and 34 men), and 24 sibs (14 women and 10 men) of 17 centenarians (7 women and 10 men). HLA-DQ alleles of all the subjects were genotyped by amplification refractory mutation system/polymerase chain reaction using primer sets and PCR conditions de- scribed by Bunce et al.12

Statistics

Pearson’s test was applied to analyze differ- ences among expected and observed HLA DQA1* and DQB1* identity, haploidentity, or nonidentity frequencies in sib pairs.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

HLA alleles and haplotypes have been se- lected throughout evolution, conferring resis- tance to infectious disease both via peptide pre- sentation and regulating type and intensity of the immune response.3,4,7 Nevertheless, HLA- DR,DQ alleles and, in some instances, HLA-DQ alleles, seem to play a central role in associa- tion with diseases.9,13–15 As previously re- ported,16 nonsignificant differences in HLA- DQA1* and -DQB1* allele frequencies were found between centenarians and controls (data not shown). On the other hand, for extreme longevity, moderate familial clustering also has been observed. Perls and coworkers found that the survival ratio for siblings of centenarians versus siblings of 73-year-olds was about four- fold that for people aged 80 to 94.17 A recent report on Danish centenarians suggests that siblings born after centenarians have a fourfold increased chance of becoming centenarians compared to their birth cohort.18 Table 1 de- scribes the results of HLA-DQ allele typing of centenarian sib pairs. The authors have not in- vestigated the association of each single DQ al- lele to longevity, because analysis of affected sib-pairs with different methods of localizing

Subjects

All subjects had been enrolled in the context of the AKEA study of Sardinian centenarians carried out between January 1 and December 31, 1997.11 One hundred and forty-one (141) centenarians underwent a full interview, and 129 donated a blood sample. The birth date of centenarians was checked by matching infor- mation from the census registry, baptism reg- istry of the local parish archive, social security documents, and the testimony of a first-degree relative. For each centenarian, a 60-year-old ~(41 ( 1 year) control of the same gender was ran- domly selected from the inhabitants of the same province. Overall, 290 sexagenarians randomly selected within the four Sardinian provinces were invited to join the study as con- trols and 154 agreed to participate and provide a blood sample. In addition, 24 ~~ 85-year-old sibs of centenarians were enrolled following the reported protocol. Written informed con- sent for enrolling in the study and personal data management was obtained from all the subjects according to Italian law.

Statistical analysis (Pearson’s chi-squared test) demonstrated that observed and expected frequencies of allele iden- tity between centenarian and sibs were not significantly different for HLA-DQA1* and DQB1* alleles.

genes that contribute to human longevity is a powerful tool in mapping very strong effects of genes.10 Mapping of less effective but con- tributing genetic variation necessitates a larger sample.10 On the other hand, the sample size allowed the evaluation of DQA* or DQB1* al-  lele sharing among centenarians and 85-year- old sibs. Nine of twenty-four sibs shared two HLA-DQA1* and 8/24 shared two HLADQB1* alleles with centenarians, but statistical analy- sis demonstrates that the observed and ex- pected frequency of allele identity between centenarian and sibs was not significantly dif- ferent both for HLA-DQA1* and DQB1* loci, suggesting that genetic settlement at the HLA DQ region is indifferent regarding longevity. In conclusion, present and previous results5,16 seem to support the hypothesis that genes in- volved or associated with HLADQ-DR haplo- types have a marginal influence, if any, in de-
