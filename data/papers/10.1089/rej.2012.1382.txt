Abstract

Genes of the proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c coactivator 1a (PPARGC1A, also termed PGC1-a)-nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-mitochondrial transcrip- tion Factor A (TFAM) mitochondriogenesis pathway can influence health/disease phenotypes, yet their as- sociation with extreme longevity is not known. We studied the association of five common polymorphisms in genes of this pathway (rs2267668, rs8192678, rs6949152, rs12594956, rs1937) and extreme longevity using a case (107 centenarians)–control (284 young adults) design. We found no between-group differences in allele/ genotype frequencies, except for CC genotype in rs1937 ( p = 0.003), with no representation in controls (0%), versus 2.8% in centenarians (2 men, 1 woman). In summary, the studied genetic variants of the PPARD- PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM pathway were not associated with extreme longevity, yet a marginal association could exist for rs1937.

Introduction

coactivator 1a (PPARGC1A, also termed PGC1-a)-nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-mitochondrial transcription Factor A (TFAM) pathway. Briefly, PPARD induces promotion of PPARGC1A,15 which is the first stimulator of mitochon- driogenesis. NRF1 and 2 (the latter being also known as GA- binding protein alpha chain [GABPA]) are intermediate transcription factors that stimulate the synthesis of TFAM, which is the final effector activating the duplication of mi- tochondrial DNA molecules.16–18

ganelles for understanding the aging process.1 They are both the main source and target of reactive oxygen spe- cies, and accumulation of somatic mutations in mitochon- drial DNA (mtDNA) is one of the main features that accompany the age-related loss of mitochondrial function.2 Because mtDNA haplotypes or haplogroups (i.e., non- pathogenic mtDNA populations that form a series of popu- lation-specific lineages) might influence individual suscepti- bility to mtDNA damage, they could theoretically influence human aging. Yet their association with extreme longevity, i.e., reaching ‡100 years of age, is controversial.3–8 Because extreme longevity is partly influenced by genetic factors,9 other genetic variants related to mitochondrial function might be involved in the heritability of this rare phenotype.

Several genetic variants could affect the PPARD-PPARGC1A- NRF-TFAM pathway and thus influence several important health/disease phenotypes related to mitochondrial func- tion. For instance, a common missense variation (Gly482Ser, rs8192678) at exon 8 of PPARGC1A gene has been repeatedly associated with type 2 diabetes19–22 and with related traits, including insulin resistance,23 obesity,24,25 hypertension,26–28 dyslipidemia,29 or aerobic fitness.30 The aforementioned poly- morphism and the A/G (rs2267668) variation in PPARD are independently implicated in the modulation of insulin sen- sitivity or aerobic fitness,31 and rs2267668 has also been as- sociated with muscle mass.32 Common variants in NRF genes (NRF1 A/G [rs6949152] and NRF2 A/C [rs12594956]) influence aerobic fitness phenotypes,33–35 whereas the TFAM Ser12Thr (rs1937) variation has been associated with late- onset36–38 or sporadic Alzheimer disease.39 Yet, no candi- date gene association study has analyzed whether genetic

taining their normal function as well as for ensuring the functional and structural integrity of post-mitotic tissues.10 Yet the capacity for mitochondrial biogenesis (or mitochon- driogenesis) diminishes with age,11,12 and is responsible for many of the deleterious effects of aging, including loss of muscle mass and function, i.e., sarcopenia.13,14 Mitochondrial synthesis is stimulated by the proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c

variants of the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM mitochon- driogenesis pathway can influence extreme longevity. Here, we have studied the association of five common polymor- phisms in the aforementioned pathway (rs8192678, rs2267668, rs2267668, rs6949152, and rs12594956) and ex- treme longevity in a Spanish (Caucasian) cohort using a case–control design.

Genotype assessment

Genotyping was performed specifically for research pur- poses. The researchers in charge of genotyping were totally blinded to the participants’ identities, i.e., saliva samples were tracked solely with barcoding and personal identities were only made available to the main study researcher who was not involved in actual genotyping. We used the classical phenol-chloroform DNA extraction protocol with alcoholic precipitation. Genomic DNA was resuspended in 50lL of milli-Q H O and stored at -20(cid:2)C. 2

Methods

The study was designed and carried out in accor- dance with the recommendations for the human genotype– phenotype association studies recently published by the National Cancer Institute–National Human Genome Re- search Institute (NCI-NHGRI) Working Group on Replica- tion in Association Studies.40 These recommendations include among others, the following items: Indicating time period and location of subject recruitment, success rate for DNA acquisition, and sample tracking methods.

Genotyping was performed in the genomics laboratory of Universidad Europea de Madrid during the summer of 2012. Allelic discrimination analysis was performed with prede-  signed Applied Biosystems TaqMan SNP Genotyping As- says on demand for the five polymorphisms: PPARD A/G (rs2267668) (ID: C__15872729_10), PPARGC1A Gly482Ser (rs8192678) (ID: C___1643192_20), NRF1 A/G (rs6949152) (ID: C__29144830_10), NRF2 A/C (rs12594956) (ID: C__32072163_20), and TFAM Ser12Thr (rs1937) (ID: C___8975662_10). PCR amplification was performed using a StepOne(cid:4) Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), with a denaturation stage at 95(cid:2)C for 10 min, 50 cycles of denaturation at 92(cid:2)C for 15 sec, anneal- ing/extension at 60(cid:2)C for 1min, and a final extension stage of 30sec at 60(cid:2)C.

Participants

Written consent was obtained from each participant. The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Universidad Europea de Madrid, Spain) and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for Human Research of 1974 (last modified in 2008). All of the study participants were of the same Caucasian (Spanish) descent for three or more generations; the majority (*90%) of them were born and lived most of their lives and in the same areas of Spain (Meseta Castellana, *600 meters altitude).

To ensure proper internal control, for each genotype analysis, we used positive and negative controls from dif- ferent DNA aliquots that were previously genotyped by the same method according to recent recommendations for replicating genotype–phenotype association studies.40 All of the analyses were performed by 2 experienced independent investigators who were blinded to subject data.

Centenarians (cases)

During 2009–2011 we obtained DNA from saliva samples in 107 centenarians of both genders (89 women, 18 men; age range, 100–111) living in nursing residencies of the Spanish central area (Meseta Castellana). This cohort included the oldest European individual, recognized by the Gerontology Research Group, a man who recently died at the age of 111 years, and *10% of the cohort was aged ‡105 years. The most prevalent diseases were osteoarthritis (80.0%), hyper- tension (72.7%), dementia (53.6%), and coronary artery dis- ease (41.8%). Four centenarians were free of any diagnosed disease.

Following recent recommendations for replicating human genotype–phenotype association studies,40 a subset of ge- notype results (rs8192678 in 100 controls) was corroborated in a second laboratory (Progenika Biopharma, Parque Tec- nolo´gico de Zamudio, Derio-Vizcaya, Spain) using a differ- ent methodology, i.e., newly developed low-density DNA microarray based on allele-specific probes. The design, fab- rication, validation, and analysis of the arrays for the latter methodology were performed following the procedure de- tailed elsewhere45 with minor modifications. The PCR products were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the DNA microarray using an automated platform (Tecan HS4800, Mannedorf, Switzerland). Finally, the microarrays were scanned (Innopsys S.A., Carbonne, France), and we determined variants using software that converts the inten- sity of the spots into the genotype of each variant.45

We evaluated the centenarians’ cognitive ability with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),41 as well as their independence/functional capacity with the Barthel index. The latter is an instrument widely used to measure the ca- pacity of a person for the execution of 10 basic activities in daily life, obtaining a quantitative estimation of the subject’s level of independency.42,43 The sum-score ranges from 0 (totally dependent) to 100 (totally independent). The median (min, max) of the MMSE and Barthel score was 11 (0, 32) and 15 (range, 0–00) respectively. Approximately 12% of the centenarians were virtually independent during daily living without assistance from other persons, i.e., their Barthel and MMSE score was ‡ 80 and > 23, respectively.44

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using the PASW (v. 18.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL). We tested Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium using a chi-squared test. We com- pared allele and genotype frequencies in cases and controls using the chi-squared test with a set at 0.05. All statistical comparisons were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method, in which the threshold p value is obtained by dividing 0.05 by the number of polymorphisms

Young adults (controls)

Inclusion criteria for this group were: (1) Age £50 years, (2) free of any diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and (3) having no known family history of high longevity (90+ years).

This mar- association remained when studying only men in both i.e., v2 = 15.696, p < 0.001 for the between-group of the frequency of CC genotype, but not when only women (v2 = 2.940, p = 0.230). We found no odds ratio for any of the genotypes or alleles we

Results

Genotype success was 100% for rs2267668, rs6949152, and rs1937, 99.7% for rs8192678, and 99.2% for rs12594956. Parallel genotyping results showed 100% concordance be- tween the two laboratories. All genotype distributions met Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in both the control and the centenarians’ group ( p > 0.05), except for TFAM Ser12Thr (rs1937) in the centenarians’ group ( p < 0.001). Figures 1 and 2 show the allele and genotype frequencies, respectively, in the two study groups. When studying men and women together in the two cohorts, we found no significant between-group differences (all p > 0.1), except for the ge- notype frequency of rs1937 (v2 = 11.440, p = 0.003), with no

Discussion

The polymorphisms we studied have been associated with several health/disease phenotypes, many of which are re- lated to mitochondrial function, notably the variant Ser allele of the PPARGC1A Gly482Ser (rs8192678) variation is asso- ciated with risk of type 2 diabetes,19(cid:2)22 insulin resistance,23 obesity,24,25, dyslipidemia,29 hypertension,26(cid:2)28 and low aer- obic fitness.30 Yet, we found no association of genetic

We only found a marginal associa- tion for the TFAM Ser(G)12Thr(C) (rs1937) polymorphism when studying the two sexes together or only men sepa- rately, with no representation of the CC genotype in the control cohort versus a total frequency of *3% in centenar- ians, included among them the oldest person in Europe until September, 2012 (disease-free man, aged 111 years). Inter- estingly, the frequency of the CC genotype in our centenar- ians’ cohort was above that previously reported for control European cohorts, with a virtual absence of the CC genotype, e.g., 0% in adolescents of both genders from Argentina (Eu- ropean descent),46 0.7% in Russian men and women,47 1.0% in European (German, Swiss, Italian) men and women (0% in men),39 and 1.8% in Spanish men and women.36

The TFAM gene, located at 10q21, encodes the key protein re- sponsible for replication and transcription of mitochondrial DNA and protects cells against oxidative stress, the latter being involved in the development of disease phenotypes, notably neurodegenerative disorders.49,50 TFAM knockout mice exhibit depletion of mtDNA and abolished oxidative phosphorylation,51 whereas heart-specific TFAM gene knockout mice display a progressive heart phenotype with depletion of mtDNA and an accompanying severe decline of respiratory chain enzyme activities and decreased mito- chondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.52 Wre- denberg et al.53 reported accumulation of abnormally appearing mitochondria, progressively deteriorating respi- ratory chain function, and reduced muscle-force production in muscle fibers of mice with skeletal muscle-specific dis- ruption of the TFAM gene. In contrast, over-expression of this gene in cardiac myocytes is associated with a two-fold

Human research has shown an association between rs1937 and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by distur- bance of mtDNA integrity and mitochondrial dysfunction, i.e., late-onset36–38 or sporadic Alzheimer disease,39 with the rare CC genotype conferring a protective effect38 and the GG being a risk genotype.36,39 Furthermore, the rare C allele has been recently associated with an ‘aerobic’ or ‘endurance- oriented phenotype’, with elite endurance athletes showing higher frequency of the C allele than non-athletic controls.47 Regarding this, a shift toward a more ‘aerobic phenotype’ could have a beneficial influence on health-related pheno- types and longevity, with classic studies in rats by Koch’s and Britton’s groups showing improved mitochondrial fit- ness may be a common factor linking physical fitness and decreased disease risk.55,56

The renewal of mitochondria through the process of bio- genesis is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity, and a diminished capacity for organelle biogenesis has been im- plicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases as well as in the aging process.57,58 A role for mitochondrial dysfunction in aging is evidenced by mtDNA mutator mice that express a proofreading-deficient mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma.59 These mutant mice have increased mtDNA mu- tations and display age-related phenotypes, including severe sarcopenia that is likely due to defects in the assembly of functional electron chain transport complexes.60 Similar findings of increased mtDNA mutagenesis and reduced mitochondrial enzyme activities have been reported in hu- man skeletal muscle with age.61 However, our findings and those recently reported by our group with part of the present centenarians’ cohort do not support a major role of genetic variants in mtDNA62 or in the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF- TFAM mitochondriogenesis pathway on extreme longevity. Other genetic variants not studied here or other non-genetic factors that are known to influence mitochondriogenesis, such as exercise or calorie restriction,1,63 might be more in- fluential to extreme longevity.

cause all of the following criteria were met64: The phenotype ‘exceptional longevity’ was properly defined with all cases being centenarians (living 100+ years is still a rare phenotype, i.e., £1 every 10,000 people9), both groups of cases and con- trols were ethnically matched, genetic assessment was unbi- ased, all genotype distributions were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the control group, and we adjusted our statis- tical analyses for multiple comparisons. The relatively low sample size of the centenarians’ cohort is a limitation. Future research is needed with larger sample sizes, especially with more centenarian men, to corroborate the existence of an as- sociation between rs1937 and extreme longevity or whether this association is sex-dependent. The lack of data in a ‘rep- lication’ cohort of a different ethnic background also limits the ‘external validity’ (and therefore generalizability) of our re- sults. On the other hand, while keeping in mind the afore- mentioned limitations, we believe the major strength of our study stems in its novelty and in the rationale for studying genetic variants in the mitochondriogenesis pathway.

In summary, common genetic variants in the PPARD- PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM pathway (rs2267668, rs8192678, rs6949152, rs12594956, rs1937) are not associated with ex-
