Abstract 

Long-living individuals (LLIs) are used to study exceptional longevity. A number of genetic variants have been found to be associated with LLIs to date but further identification of variants would improve knowledge on the mechanisms regulating the rate of aging. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study on 410 LLIs and 553 young control individuals with a 317K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to identify novel traits associated with aging. Among the top (p < 1x10^4) SNPs initially identified, we found rs10491334 (CAMKIV) (odds ratio [OR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.73; p=2.88x10^5), a variant previously reported to be associated with diastolic blood pressure. It was also associated in a replication set of 116 LLIs and 160 controls (OR=0.54; 95% CI 0.32-0.90; p=9x10^3). Furthermore, in vitro analysis established that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) activates the survival proteins AKT, SIRT1, and FOXO3A. We found that homozygous carriers of rs10491334 have a significant reduction in CAMKIV expression. This, together with the observed reduction in minor-allele carriers among centenarians, points to a detrimental role for the SNP. In conclusion, prolongevity genes are activated by CAMKIV, the levels of which are influenced by rs10491334, a SNP associated with human longevity.

Introduction 

APOE is involved in lipid transport to the lymphatic system; its gene was the first to be successfully replicated as one important in exceptional longevity.12 FOXO3A mediates a prosurvival activity by regulating the cellular response to stimuli ranging from radical stress to growth factors (insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1]) and by acting on the transcription of genes involved in radical stress response, cell cycle arrest, proliferation, and apoptosis.13,14 Protein kinase B (AKT)-dependent phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-dependent deacetylation of FOXO3A induce prosurvival activity by activating genes linked to the stress response and to cell cycle arrest and by inhibiting proapoptotic genes.15 In humans, genetic alterations of the IGF-1 receptor that alter the IGF signaling pathway confer an increase in propensity for longevity.16 Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of AKT have also been associated with human longevity.11 

Long-living individuals (LLIs), that is, those that approach 100 years of age, are a model of successful aging. Most of them have a compression of disability and morbidity toward the end of their life and tend not to show changes normally observed during aging, such as decreases in insulin sensitivity and in heart rate variability (HRV).13 The exceptional longevity of LLIs is to some extent genetically driven, as underlined by the familial clustering effect for extreme longevity and the reduced mortality of centenarian siblings compared to those of noncentenarians.4,5 To date, the most remarkable genetic findings for exceptional longevity observed in the genome of centenarians are the decreased frequency of detrimental alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and the increase of protective alleles of forkhead box 1.

The study was conducted following the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki. The significance threshold was chosen by estimating the false-positive fraction for various significance thresholds P on simulated datasets. Data simulation involved generating 100 independent datasets comprising 317K SNPs, with MAF distribution ranging from 0.05 to 0.50, and 963 control samples to which 410 case and 553 control labels were randomly assigned. We then tested for association between each marker and the case/control status by assuming allelic, dominant, and recessive genetic models and selecting the most significant marker as the most informative for each SNP. For each significance threshold (from p-value 0.05 to p<1x10^-7), we estimated the mean fraction of false positive associations (a false positive association was defined as a SNP with p lower than the selected significance threshold P) over 100 simulated datasets for each P.

Determination of genotypes: Genotyping was performed with the Infinium II Assay-HumanHap BeadChip 317K duo system (Illumina, San Diego, California) using standard protocols of the Illumina HumanHap 317 Duo workflow (Illumina, San Diego, CA). All genotypes were evaluated using a quantitative quality score called GenCall (GC) score. The GC score ranges from 0 to 1 and reflects the proximity within a cluster plot of the intensities of that genotype to the centroid of the nearest cluster.

Testing for association: Association between the set of SNPs passing QC criteria and longevity phenotype was tested by means of one degree of freedom (df) Pearson chi-squared allelic association test (a [minor allele] vs. A [major allele]) and assuming a dominant (aa/aA vs. AA, 1 df) and recessive genetic effect (aa vs. aA/AA, 1 df). Logistic regression assuming additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models was applied to estimate odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each of the different genetic models, to test for association in the replication set, and to evaluate potentially confounding gender-specific effects. Adjustment for potential confounding effects due to residual genetic stratification was done with the genomic control approach.24

Quality control analyses: Samples and SNPs with a Call Rate lower than 93% and 95%, respectively, as well as SNPs deviating from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) (p<1.72x10^-7) or with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05 were removed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on a reduced set of autosomal markers showing r2 estimates <0.2, using the default outliers removal threshold (sigma 6) as implemented in Eigenstrat software.20 All statistical procedures were performed using PLINK,25 except when specified.

In vitro evaluation of CAMKIV: Imputation of unobserved genotypes: Cell cultures. Human colon adenocarcinoma grade II HT29 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media were supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. The cells were seeded at 2x10^6 cells/mL and infected with the appropriate lentivirus. Expression of CAMKIV-WT was confirmed by western blot using a specific antibody against CAMKIV. SNPs that were not represented on the Illumina Infinium II Assay-HumanHap BeadChip 317K were imputed by the Impute v2.1.2 software,21 using the 1,000 Genomes files from CEU (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain [CEPH] [Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe]) genotypes data (release March 2010) as reference panel.

Linkage disequilibrium analyses: Mononuclear cells. Blood was collected and anticoagulated with EDTA. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll gradient using HISTOPAQUE-1077 (Sigma, USA). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses were performed using Haploview v4.2 software.22 Haplotype blocks were frozen and stored at -80Â°C until the day of the assay. All procedures were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines for human research.26 Mononuclear cells were chosen based on previous knowledge that CAMKIV is expressed in these cells and on the assumption that a genotype/expression correlation is not tissue-specific, thus reflecting expression modification in allBy pseudotyping with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) using a quadruple transfection protocol in 293T cells, approximately 2x106 HT29 cells were infected with the appropriate lentivirus: CAMKIV-WT (CAMKIV), or empty lentivirus (mock) as a control. The initial screening dataset was composed of 466 LLIs, 624 controls, and 318,237 SNPs. After a preliminary phase of QC, as described in the Methods section, we looked for evidence of genetic population stratification on a subset of 454 LLIs and 591 young controls by applying PCA20. A graphical inspection of the first two principal components revealed genetic homogeneity between LLIs and controls (Fig. 1). 

After outliers were removed (n=82), the final GWAS dataset was composed of 963 samples, of which 410 were cases (age range, 90-109 years; male/female ratio, 1.47; see Supplementary Table 1 for a detailed demographic and clinical characterization of SICS LLIs9) and 553 were controls (age range, 18-48 years; male/female ratio, 1.56). A total of 298,715 SNPs passed the overall QC criteria.

For western blot analysis, mouse and rabbit monoclonal antibodies to SIRT1 and anti-phospho-SIRT1 were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Polyclonal antibodies to FOXO3A, phospho-FOXO3A (Ser253), AKT, and phospho-AKT (Ser473) were purchased from Cell Signaling technology. Monoclonal CAMKIV antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare different groups using Bonferroni post hoc analysis. A significance level of p < 0.05 was assumed for all statistical evaluations. Statistics were computed with GraphPad Prism Software (San Diego, California). Each value in the figures represents mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent experiments.

We then tested for association between each of the identified SNPs and longevity phenotype. Inspection of the quantile-quantile plots (Supplementary Fig. 1) and the estimated genomic inflation factor (Î»)24 for the different genetic models revealed a moderate residual effect of population stratification on the association results (allelic Î», 1.09; dominant Î», 1.07; recessive Î», 1.00). Therefore, we decided to remove this potential confounding factor by genomic control adjustment24.

Simulation results (see Methods) showed that the rate of false-positive findings was a function of the significance inclusion cutoff, suggesting that the choice of p < 1x10^-4 for at least one of the evaluated genetic models as the significance would guarantee a false-positive rate of approximately 2 in 10,000 independent tests (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Association study: Although GWAS does not rely on choosing the right gene beforehand, they do require a large sample size to support with adequate power the hundreds of thousands of SNPs.

rs130329 22 RMCAMKIV and longevity in Southern Italian Centenarians. Our findings suggest that the CAMKIV gene plays a prosurvival role by inducing the phosphorylation of SIRT1, AKT, and FOXO3A. This mechanism promotes cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress resistance, which are key factors in aging and longevity. 

To investigate the effect of rs10491334 on CAMKIV protein expression, we compared mononuclear cells from homozygous carriers to those from individuals carrying the wild-type gene. We found that the protein level of CAMKIV is significantly lower in homozygous carriers. Additionally, our study revealed a higher frequency of wild-type CAMKIV genotypes among LLIs, supporting a prosurvival role for CAMKIV.

Our results suggest that CAMKIV could represent a potential target for fighting aging-associated illness. Further studies are needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between CAMKIV and longevity.genome-wide association studies. Nat Genet 2006;38:904-909.
