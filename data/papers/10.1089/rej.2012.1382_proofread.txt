Abstract:
Genes of the proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c coactivator 1a (PPARGC1A, also termed PGC1-a)-nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-mitochondrial transcription Factor A (TFAM) mitochondriogenesis pathway can influence health/disease phenotypes, yet their association with extreme longevity is not known. We studied the association of five common polymorphisms in genes of this pathway (rs2267668, rs8192678, rs6949152, rs12594956, rs1937) and extreme longevity using a case-control design. We found no between-group differences in allele/genotype frequencies, except for the CC genotype in rs1937 (p=0.003), with no representation in controls (0%), versus 2.8% in centenarians (2 men and 1 woman). In summary, the studied genetic variants of the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM pathway were not associated with extreme longevity, yet a marginal association could exist for rs1937.

Introduction:
Mitochondria are essential organelles for understanding the aging process. They are both the main source and target of reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is one of the main features that accompanies age-related loss of mitochondrial function. Because mtDNA haplotypes or haplogroups might influence individual susceptibility to mtDNA damage, they could theoretically influence human aging. However, their association with extreme longevity, i.e., reaching 100 years of age, is controversial. Because extreme longevity is partly influenced by genetic factors, other genetic variants related to mitochondrial function might be involved in the heritability of this rare phenotype.

Several genetic variants could affect the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM pathway and thus influence several important health/disease phenotypes related to mitochondrial function. For instance, a common missense variation (Gly482Ser, rs8192678) at exon 8 of the PPARGC1A gene has been repeatedly associated with type 2 diabetes and with related traits, including insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or aerobic fitness. The aforementioned polymorphism and the A/G (rs2267668) variation in PPARD are independently implicated in the modulation of insulin sensitivity or aerobic fitness. Common variants in NRF genes (NRF1 A/G [rs6949152] and NRF2 A/C [rs12594956]) influence aerobic fitness phenotypes, whereas the TFAM Ser12Thr (rs1937) variation has been associated with late-onset or sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Yet no candidate gene association study has analyzed whether genetic variants of the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM mitochondriogenesis pathway can influence extreme longevity. Here, we have studied the association of five common polymorphisms in the aforementioned pathway (rs8192678, rs2267668, rs6949152, rs12594956, and rs1937) and extreme longevity in a Spanish (Caucasian) cohort using a case-control design.

Methods:
The study was designed and carried out in accordance with the recommendations for human genotype-phenotype association studies recently published by the National Cancer Institute-National Human Genome Research Institute (NCI-NHGRI) Working Group on Replication in Association Studies. Genotyping was performed specifically for research purposes. The researchers in charge of genotyping were totally blinded to the participants' identities, and saliva samples were tracked solely with barcoding. We used the classical phenol-chloroform DNA extraction protocol with alcoholic precipitation. Genomic DNA was resuspended in 50 μL of milli-Q H2O and stored at -20°C.

Genotyping was performed in the genomics laboratory of Universidad Europea de Madrid during the summer of 2012. Allelic discrimination analysis was performed with predesigned Applied Biosystems TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays on demand for the five polymorphisms: PPARD A/G (rs2267668) (ID: C__15872729_10), PPARGC1A Gly482Ser (rs8192678) (ID: C___1643192_20), NRF1 A/G (rs6949152) (ID: C__29144830_10), NRF2 A/C (rs12594956) (ID: C__32072163_20), and TFAM Ser12Thr (rs1937) (ID: C___8975662_10). PCR amplification was performedGenotype results for rs8192678 were confirmed in a second laboratory, Progenika Biopharma in Derio-Vizcaya, Spain, using a new low-density DNA microarray based on allele-specific probes. The arrays were designed, fabricated, validated, and analyzed following a procedure detailed elsewhere with minor modifications. The PCR products were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the DNA microarray using an automated platform (Tecan HS4800, Mannedorf, Switzerland). The microarrays were scanned (Innopsys S.A., Carbonne, France), and variants were determined using software that converts the intensity of the spots into the genotype of each variant. Cognitive ability was evaluated in the centenarians using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and their independence/functional capacity with the Barthel index. The Barthel index is an instrument widely used to measure a person's capacity for the execution of 10 basic activities in daily life, obtaining a quantitative estimation of their level of independence. The sum-score ranges from 0 (totally dependent) to 100 (totally independent). Approximately 12% of the centenarians were virtually independent during daily living without assistance from other persons, i.e., their Barthel and MMSE score was 80 and >23, respectively. 

All statistical analyses were performed using PASW (v. 18.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL). Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was tested using a chi-squared test. We compared allele and genotype frequencies in cases and controls using the chi-squared test with a set at 0.05. All statistical comparisons were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method, in which the threshold p value is obtained by dividing 0.05 by the number of polymorphisms studied.

The inclusion criteria for young adults (controls) were: (1) Age 50 years, (2) free of any diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and (3) having no known family history of high longevity (90+ years). We also used logistic regression to analyze the association between alleles and longevity after adjusting for sex. The frequency of the CC genotype in the control group was 0%, while it was 2.8% in centenarians (2 men, 1 woman). This marginal association remained when studying only men in both cohorts, i.e., v2 = 15.696, p < 0.001 for the between-group frequency of CC genotype, but not when studying only women (v2 = 2.940, p = 0.230). We found no odds ratio for any of the genotypes or alleles we studied.

All genotype distributions met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the control and centenarian groups (p > 0.05), except for TFAM Ser12Thr (rs1937) in the centenarians group (p < 0.001). Figures 1 and 2 show the allele and genotype frequencies, respectively, in the two study groups. When studying men and women together in the two cohorts, we found no significant between-group differences (all p > 0.1), except for the genotype frequency of rs1937 (v2 = 11.440, p = 0.003), with no representation of the CC genotype in the control cohort versus a total frequency of *3% in centenarians, including among them the oldest person in Europe until September 2012 (a disease-free man aged 111 years).

The polymorphisms we studied have been associated with several health/disease phenotypes related to mitochondrial function, notably the variant Ser allele of the PPARGC1A Gly482Ser (rs8192678) variation is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and low aerobic fitness. Yet, we found no association of genetic variants in the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM pathway and extreme longevity. We only found a marginal association for the TFAM Ser12Thr (rs1937) polymorphism when studying the two sexes together or only men separately, with a certain survival benefit existing for the rare, low-risk CC genotype. More research is needed on other genetic variants potentially associated with maintenance of mitochondrial function.The text seems to be a part of a scientific paper discussing the role of genetic variants in the mitochondriogenesis pathway in extreme longevity.

Phenotype, with elite endurance athletes showing a higher frequency of the C allele than non-athletic controls. Regarding this, a shift toward a more aerobic phenotype could have a beneficial influence on health-related phenotypes and longevity, with classic studies in rats by Koch's and Britton's groups showing improved mitochondrial fitness may be a common factor linking physical fitness and decreased disease risk.

The renewal of mitochondria through the process of biogenesis is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity, and a diminished capacity for organelle biogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases as well as in the aging process. A role for mitochondrial dysfunction in aging is evidenced by mtDNA mutator mice that express a proofreading-deficient mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. These mutant mice have increased mtDNA mutations and display age-related phenotypes, including severe sarcopenia that is likely due to defects in the assembly of functional electron chain transport complexes. Similar findings of increased mtDNA mutagenesis and reduced mitochondrial enzyme activities have been reported in human skeletal muscle with age. However, our findings and those recently reported by our group with part of the present centenarians cohort do not support a major role of genetic variants in mtDNA or in the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM mitochondriogenesis pathway on extreme longevity. Other genetic variants not studied here or other non-genetic factors that are known to influence mitochondriogenesis, such as exercise or calorie restriction, might be more influential to extreme longevity.

Because all of the following criteria were met: The phenotype exceptional longevity was properly defined with all cases being centenarians (living 100+ years is still a rare phenotype, i.e., 1 every 10,000 people), both groups of cases and controls were ethnically matched, genetic assessment was unbiased, all genotype distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group, and we adjusted our statistical analyses for multiple comparisons. The relatively low sample size of the centenarians cohort is a limitation. Future research is needed with larger sample sizes, especially with more centenarian men, to corroborate the existence of an association between rs1937 and extreme longevity or whether this association is sex-dependent. The lack of data in a replication cohort of a different ethnic background also limits the external validity (and therefore generalizability) of our results. On the other hand, while keeping in mind the aforementioned limitations, we believe the major strength of our study stems from its novelty and in the rationale for studying genetic variants in the mitochondriogenesis pathway.

In summary, common genetic variants in the PPARD-PPARGC1A-NRF-TFAM pathway (rs2267668, rs8192678, rs6949152, rs12594956, rs1937) are not associated with extreme longevity.The processed text is:
