Current literature indicates that elevated IL-6 serum levels are associated with diseases, dis- ability and mortality in the elderly. In this paper, we studied the IL-6 promoter genetic vari- ability at –174 C/G locus and its effect on IL-6 serum levels in a total of 700 people from 60 to 110 years of age, including 323 centenarians. We found that the proportion of homozy- gotes for the G allele at –174 locus decreases in centenarian males, but not in centenarian females. Moreover, we found that, only among males, homozygotes for the G allele at –174 locus have higher IL-6 serum levels in comparison with carriers of the C allele. On the whole, our data suggest that those individuals who are genetically predisposed to produce high levels of IL-6 during aging, i.e. –174 locus GG homozygous men, are disadvantaged for

1 Introduction

able marker for functional disability, and as a predictor of disability and mortality among elderly [8, 9]. IL-6 dysre- gulation has been thought to be involved in the patho- genesis of a variety of age-related diseases, such as dia- betes and atherosclerosis, which have a substantial inflammatory pathogenesis [10, 11]. A C/G polymor- phism located at 5’-upstream of IL-6 (–174 C/G locus) has been identified [12]: this base transition is associated with different IL-6 plasma levels in healthy subjects, and affects the rate of IL-6 gene transcription [12, 13]. In the present investigation, a total of 700 subjects ranging from 60 to 110 years of age (including 323 centenarians) was genotyped for –174 C/G locus variability to obtain information on the age-related changes in the proportion of people carrying different –174 C/G alleles. Moreover, 269 of these subjects (from 60 to 110 years of age) were studied to assess the impact of –174 C/G locus on IL-6 serum levels.

An age-related increase of IL-6 concentration has been found in serum, plasma, and supernatants of mononu- clear blood cell cultures from elderly people and cente- narians [1–3]. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine capable of regulating proliferation, differentiation and activity of a variety of cell types [3], and plays a pivotal role in neuro- endocrine and immune system homeostasis [4]. In par- ticular, IL-6 plays a major role in acute phase response and in the balancing of the pro-inflammatory/anti- inflammatory pathways [5]. An age-related increase of IL-6 serum level among elderly people devoid of any overt age-related disease [3], beginning as early as 30–40 years of age [6], and being prominent among men [7], has been observed. Recent population-based stud- ies identified the magnitude of IL-6 serum level as a reli-

A total of 700 individuals (482 women and 218 men), ranging from 60 to 110 years of age was subdivided into three age-groups (60–80, 81–99 and G 99 years of age), and was assessed for –174 C/G locus variability. CC and

CG genotypes were grouped and indicated as “C+”, and GG genotype was named as “C–”. The female to male ratio in centenarians was 3.75, in agreement with that reported in a recent nationwide study on Italian centenar- ians [14]. Due to the heterogeneity of male to female pro- portions in the three age groups, genders were analyzed separately. Genotype distributions fitted with the expec- tations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p G 0.05). As shown in Table 1, elderly and long-lived men had similar

C allele frequency (24% in both groups), whilst the fre- quency of C allele was increased in centenarian men (35%). Accordingly, C– individuals were significantly under-represented among centenarian men (38%), whilst no difference was found between elderly and long- lived men (58% in both groups). As shown in Table 2, no difference was found when the frequency of the C allele and the percentage of C+ / C– individuals were analyzed in the three age groups of women.

The impact of –174 C/G locus on IL-6 serum levels was evaluated in a subgroup of 269 individuals. Data are shown in Fig. 1. In all three age groups, C– men had higher IL-6 serum levels than C+ men. Statistical analy- sis revealed that among elderly people (Fig. 1, A) C– men had the highest IL-6 serum levels, and that C+ men had the lowest IL-6 serum levels in centenarians (Fig. 1, C). In women, the impact of –174 C/G in each age group on IL-6 was not significant.

bin, a higher fasting insulin levels, and an higher insulin sensitivity [19, 20]. Accordingly, recent data suggest that C+ men may be protected from cardiovascular diseases. In particular, an under-representation of homozygotes for C allele at –174 locus has been found in a group of Swedish men having a myocardial infarction under age 40 [21]. Moreover, in middle-aged men, homozygotes for the G allele at –174 C/G locus have an increased artery intima-media thickness in the carotid bifurcation, a pre- dilection site for atherosclerosis [22]. On a demographic point of view, the decreased proportion of C– men in centenarians could be thus attributed to a higher mortal- ity of C– men for cardiovascular diseases, which are the most prominent causes of mortality among elderly in Western countries. However, the possibility cannot be excluded, that a gene variant in tight linkage disequilib- rium with IL-6 –174 C/G locus could be responsible, at least in part, for the results here presented, as well as for the above mentioned data, suggesting an association between this locus and susceptibility to diseases or pathological conditions.

Finally, a significant increase of IL-6 serum level was found in women ( U = 0.357, p= 0.001 for C+, U spearman spear- = 0.398, p= 0.0001 for C–), but not in men ( U = man spearman 0.016, p= 0.904 for C+; U = 0.202, p= 0.169 for C–). spearman

3 Discussion

The major finding reported in the present paper is that those individuals who are genetically predisposed to produce high levels of IL-6 during aging, i.e. C– men at IL-6 –174 C/G locus, have a reduced capacity to reach the extreme limits of human life-span. On the other hands, the capability of producing low levels of IL-6 throughout life-span (C+ individuals) appears to be ben- eficial for longevity, at least in men. Longitudinal studies are necessary to definitely confirm or disprove this pre- diction.

A great deal of data indicate that aging is characterized by an unbalance of proinflammatory status [18], and that inflammatory markers, IL-6 in particular, are associated with age-related diseases, and predict disability and mortality in the elderly [8, 9, 23]. Accordingly, the data presented here suggest that in an aging population, those people who have the tendency to produce ele- vated IL-6 quantities are less likely to reach the goal of longevity, and this fact is likely due to their increased proneness to develop age-related inflammatory dis- eases. If this perspective is correct, here we present a marker, the –174 C/G, which could help in identifying these “frail” individuals, far beyond the onset of any clini- cal and biochemical features.

In this investigation, we also found that women experi- ence high IL-6 serum levels later in life in respect to men, and that the age-related increase of IL-6 serum levels in women is quite independent from –174 C/G locus activ- ity. The inhibitory tone of estrogens on IL-6 gene expres- sion could explain such a gender difference [15], only if assuming that its long-term effects last until the extreme limits of human life-span.

4 Materials and methods

Intriguingly, this investigation is not the first report of a gender difference in the impact of a genetic factor on human longevity. Indeed, a similar male-specific differ- ence between young people and centenarians has been previously observed when the distribution of other germ- line variants of stress response genes (Mitochondrial DNA and Tyrosine Hydroxylase) were studied [16, 17]. Accordingly, we have proposed that men depend more on genetics than women to achieve longevity [18]. Con- versely, it can be hypothesize that female longevity depends more on environment or that in women genetic factors become important later in life.

4.1 Subjects

Blood cell DNA was collected from 700 randomly selected individuals, (482 women and 218 men), including 323 cente- narians, born and resident in Italy. All of the subjects were of Italian origin. In particular, three age groups were consid- ered: 194 randomly selected elderly people (age range 60–80 years, median age = 71, 93 men and 101 women), 183 randomly selected long-lived people (age range 81–99 years, median age = 91 years, 57 men and 126 women), and 323 centenarians (median age = 101, 68 men and 255 women). Serum was obtained from a subset of 269 individu- als (181 women and 88 men): a group of elderly people (age–range 60–80 years, median age = 73 years, 42 men and 47 women), a group of long-lived people (age-range 81–99 years, median age 94 years, 28 males and 82

4.2 Genotyping

DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes by phenol chlo- roform according to standard procedures. Amplification of the –174 C/G locus was performed as previously described [24].

4.3 Immunoassay for IL-6

Sera were frozen and kept at –80°C. IL-6 serum level was quantified with an immunoassay kit (BioSource Cytoscreen human IL-6 UltraSensitive kit). The minimum detectable amount was 0.10 pg/ml.

4.4 Statistical analysis

Non-normally distributed IL-6 serum level was ln- transformed, as previously suggested [8]. General Linear Models (GLM) was employed to test hypothesis regarding the age-adjusted effects of binary factors (–174 C/G locus). When necessary, Bonferroni adjustment for multiple com- parisons was applied, and indicated by p . Allelic and adj genotypic frequencies were compared by Monte-Carlo £ 2, implemented in SPSS package (SPSS, Chicago, IL). HWE was calculated by Monte Carlo Markov Chain [25].
