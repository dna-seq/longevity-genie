dysfunction, and cellular senescence.[10] Classical molecular and cellular biomarkers of aging include telomere length, DNA methylation, oxidative stress markers, protein carbonyls, advanced glycation end products, and mitochondrial DNA deletions.[2] These biomarkers have been extensively studied and have shown strong correlations with age. However, they do not provide information on the specific mechanisms of aging that affect each individual. 

3. Omics-Based Biomarkers
Omics-based biomarkers have emerged as a promising approach to assess the multifactorial processes of aging. These biomarkers analyze various molecular data sets, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. By integrating these data sets, omics-based biomarkers can provide a more comprehensive view of the aging process than classical biomarkers.[2] 

Recent studies have identified several omics-based biomarkers that are strongly associated with age. These include epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation patterns,[4] transcriptomic signatures of aging,[5] and proteomic profiles of aging.[6] These biomarkers have the potential to reveal novel molecular targets for anti-aging interventions and to predict health outcomes better than classical biomarkers.

4. Future Directions 
In the future, it will be essential to develop biomarker panels that can account for the heterogeneity of the aging process between individuals. Such panels could include both classical and omics-based biomarkers to provide a more comprehensive assessment of aging. Moreover, longitudinal studies are needed to determine the predictive power of these biomarkers for health outcomes. Finally, it will be critical to translate these findings into clinical practice by developing non-invasive and cost-effective methods for assessing biological age.

Overall, the development of reliable biomarkers for assessing biological age is essential for predicting health outcomes and developing effective anti-aging interventions. While classical biomarkers have shown strong correlations with age, omics-based biomarkers have the potential to provide a more comprehensive view of the aging process. In the future, a combination of classical and omics-based biomarkers will likely be used to assess aging in individuals and predict health outcomes., which cause oxidative stress and further mitochondrial damage.[26] This damage can lead to a vicious cycle of increasing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that contributes to aging and age-related diseases.[27] Mitochondrial dysfunction can be detected by measuring ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress can also be measured directly by assessing levels of reactive oxygen species or indirectly by examining markers of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA.[28] However, it should be noted that while mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are strongly associated with aging, their causal relationship with the aging process is still a matter of debate.[29] 

2.4. Dysregulated Nutrient Sensing

Nutrient sensing pathways such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), target of rapamycin (TOR), and sirtuins play key roles in regulating metabolism, growth, and stress response. Dysregulation of these pathways has been implicated in aging and age-related diseases.[30] For example, reduced activity of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway has been shown to increase lifespan in various organisms,[31] while overactivation of the TOR pathway has been linked to aging and age-related diseases such as cancer.[32] Sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases, have also been implicated in the regulation of lifespan in various organisms.[33] Dysregulated nutrient sensing can be detected by measuring the activity of these pathways or their downstream effectors.

2.5. Cellular Senescence

Cellular senescence is a process by which cells irreversibly stop dividing in response to various stresses such as DNA damage or oncogenic signaling.[34] Senescent cells accumulate with age and contribute to tissue dysfunction through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-degrading enzymes collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).[35] Cellular senescence can be detected by measuring markers such as senescence-associated -galactosidase activity or the expression of p16INK4a and p21CIP1, which are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that induce senescence.[36]

2.6. Altered Intercellular Communication

Cell-to-cell communication is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis, and alterations in intercellular communication have been implicated in aging and age-related diseases.[37] For example, age-related changes in the extracellular matrix can lead to altered signaling through integrins and other cell surface receptors,[38] while changes in the secretion of growth factors and cytokines can disrupt paracrine signaling.[39] Altered intercellular communication can be detected by measuring the expression of cell surface receptors, secreted factors, or downstream signaling effectors.(ROS).[26] The observed decline in ATP production with age (8% per decade) causes energetic deficiency and likely contributes to lower physical performance in elders.[26] Elevated intracellular levels of ROS together with an imbalance in antioxidant defenses provoke oxidative stress known to be involved in the development of many pathological conditions.[27] Recent studies have suggested a more complex relationship between oxidative stress and aging, as some low levels of ROS may provoke signaling pathways associated with longevity[26,28]; moreover, most strategies to mitigate ROS have not led to lifespan extension in animal models.[28,29] Oxidative stress can be measured directly by ROS or indirectly by specific chemical derivatives resulting from ROS-induced modification of biological macromolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids), which are typically more stable than ROS molecules and presented in detectable quantities in biological fluids and tissues. The predominant products of oxidative damage of nucleic acids are 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), associated with many age-related conditions, including arthritis, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cataracts, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.[30] A reliable marker of lipid peroxidation is 8-iso prostaglandin F2 (F2-isoprostane), which is a peroxidation product of arachidonic acid or other polyunsaturated fatty acids presented in phospholipid membranes.[31] Similar to DNA damage markers, F2-isoprostane concentration increases with age and high levels are observed in a number of diseases commonly encountered in elderly patients.[30] The most abundant markers of protein oxidative modification are protein carbonyls. Proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids possessing free amino groups can non-enzymatically react with reducing sugars, and via a chain of intermediate reactions form cross-linked and non-degradable aggregates, termed advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Among the most representative and intensively studied AGEs are carboxymethyl-lysine, carboxymethyl-valine, and pentosidine.[32] AGEs accumulate slowly in human tissues during normal aging but may accelerate when blood glucose levels are elevated, suggesting that AGEs contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetic complications.[33,34] Some AGEs exhibit fluorescence, providing opportunities for the noninvasive detection of AGEs deposition in human tissues.[32] Advanced lipoxidation end-products (ALEs) formed by a non-enzymatic reaction between macromolecules and reactive aldehydic compounds, arising from lipid peroxidation, may also be used as an indicator of oxidative stress.[35] Proteostasis network machinery, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress lead to loss of normal cell function and altered proliferation. As a result, cells can undergo a transition into an irreversible non-proliferative senescence state which contributes to decreased stemness. Besides a senescence state, cells can go into a reversible non-proliferative quiescent state or die by various cell death mechanisms. Altered paracrine and endocrine communication, as well as intercellular matrix remodeling, also affect cell functioning. Figure 1 provides an overview of molecular and cellular biomarkers of aging. Accumulation of molecular damage within a cell due to genomic instability and mutations, epigenetic modification, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress lead to loss of normal cell function and altered proliferation.of a single hematopoietic stem cell, suggesting that stem cell clones can persist for many decades in humans.[56] 

Cellular senescence is a state in which cells are unable to divide, either due to telomere attrition or external stress stimuli such as DNA damage or abnormal oncogene activation. Senescent cells are metabolically active and secrete inflammatory cytokines through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The long-term accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to age-related conditions such as stem cell exhaustion, immunosenescence, inflammaging, and chronic diseases. Accurate identification of senescent cells in a tissue section or cell culture requires joint use of several biomarkers. Decreases in cell proliferation can be assessed by mRNA and protein levels of cell cycle regulators (p16INK4a, p21CIP1, and p53), as well as DNA damage response and repair quantified by foci analysis of double-strand break markers. Stem cell aging is driven generally by similar molecular parameters as differentiated cells. Stem cell numbers within organ tissues are difficult to count, but some research has been done on particular groups such as circulating hematopoietic stem cells. Mutations naturally occurring in blood cells during a lifetime and revealed by whole-genome sequencing can be used as a barcode for tracking and quantifying adult stem cells and their offspring in the bloodstream.Only two hematopoietic stem cell clones[56] were found, suggesting that the diversity of active stem cells is significantly depleted at an advanced age. These findings have been replicated in individuals of many ages, revealing the general trend that human hematopoiesis shifts from a highly polyclonal into a quasi-monoclonal state with increasing age.[57] The biomarkers mentioned above are widely validated but are found within the cell and therefore require cell isolation (and usually destruction) for analysis. For clinical implementation, it is more useful to rely on molecules that are secreted into the adjacent extracellular area and can be detected without disturbing the cells in human subjects. The various SASP components, such as inflammatory molecules (cytokines and chemokines, extracellular damage-associated alarmin high-mobility group box 1 [HMGB1] protein), growth factors and regulators (transforming growth factor beta [TGF], insulin-like growth factor-binding protein), formin (TAME) Biomarkers Workgroup established a framework for the selection of blood-based biomarkers for next-generation geroscience clinical trials.[65] Data on the quantity of active stem cells in other organs and how their abundance and functionality change with age would be very pertinent, especially in the context of novel therapeutic approaches, such as direct reprogramming of differentiated tissue cells[58] or rejuvenation of dysfunctional adult stem cells,[59] designed to maintain robust stem cell pools.

3.2. Inflammatory Markers

Aging is often associated with the dysregulation of the immune system, leading to chronic systemic low-grade inflammation. Circulating pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and their soluble receptors (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, TNF-, TNFRs), C-X-C motif chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10), C-C motif chemokines (CCL2, also known as MCP-1, CL11 also known as eotaxin), CX3C motif chemokine (CX3CL1) as well as acute phase C-reactive protein produced in liver in response to inflammation are among promising biomarkers of aging.[1] Due to the fact that many of these mediators are classical SASP components, cellular senescence is likely to participate in inflammaging, albeit the true extent to which senescence contributes to systemic markers compared to other inflammatory drivers remains unknown. Additional information regarding age-related changes in immune function can be obtained from immune-phenotype profiling (lymphocyte subset panel, CD4:CD8 T cell ratio).[6]

2.6. Altered Intercellular Communication

Although cell aging is assumed to be the main cause of overall human aging, our body consists not only of cells but also of the extracellular space, which is likewise affected by time. Cross-linking of extracellular matrix molecules, especially collagen, and accumulation of waste products, such as AGEs, make the cell environment rigid, impeding cell-cell interaction and cell migration within tissues.[60] In contrast to the intracellular space, which has efficient intracellular mechanisms of waste recycling, the extracellular space lacks such machinery and disposal of garbage outside the cell is a serious age-related problem. Regulatory and effector molecules that are secreted into an immediate environment, such as various SASP components or found in circulating body fluids such as hormones, systemic inflammatory markers, and circulating miRNAs also contribute to altered cell communication and activity with age. Despite no standard cytokine signature existing in age-related chronic inflammation in contrast to the acute inflammatory response for which a number of secreted molecules have been validated, a deep-learning-based inflammatory aging (iAGE) clock has been recently created (Table S1, Supporting Information).[66] The clock is based on circulating immune protein data of 50 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, with the ability to predict multimorbidity with 0.41 mean absolute error. In centenarians, iAge was on average 40 years lower than their corresponding chronological age, with the chemokine CXCL9 and down-regulated Sirtuin-3 as the strongest contributors.

3. Systemic Biomarkers

Going further up in the hierarchical structure of the human body, the aging process can be ultimately observed at the system level as well. The functional decline in specific tissues and organs due to the accumulation of aged cells, complicated by intrasystem/intersystem interactions and environmental factors (e.g., diet, lifestyle) may be best measured by systemic molecular biomarkers. Although these biomarkers reflect deleterious consequences of aging rather than primary causes such as molecular damage, they provide essential input to developing prediction models for biological age comprising information from multiple systems throughout the body.[61]

3.3. Metabolic Markers

Altered energy metabolism is another major feature of aging. At the cellular level, it occurs predominantly due to the disruption inConsequent impairment in cellular utilization of metabolic substrates, especially glucose, leads to decreased energy production. The level of blood glucose is primarily determined by insulin secretion, which, in turn, is affected by gradual decline of beta-cell function and mass. [68] Glucose uptake and oxidation are often reduced later in life with the onset and progression of peripheral insulin resistance, particularly in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which can lead to weight loss and frailty observed in the elderly. [34] Population-based studies revealed that centenarians have higher insulin sensitivity and preserved beta-cell function than younger controls. [69] This suggests the importance of normal energy metabolism for healthy aging. Biomarkers of dysregulated glucose metabolism, especially glycated haemoglobin HbA1C, despite being typically used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, can also be applied as prognostic biomarkers for non-diabetics. [70] However, given the complexity of regulation of glucose and insulin levels, metabolic measures can be difficult to interpret. [8]

3.1. Classical Blood-Based Biomarkers

Biochemical, and especially blood-based biomarkers are probably the most investigated group due to a large amount of data accumulated in clinical trials. A number of parameters routinely measured in a comprehensive metabolic panel (glucose, albumin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), complete blood count (red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit), and lipid profile (total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride concentration) were found to correlate with age, age-related disease, and mortality. [8,62] For instance, lipid fractions, glucose, and albumin are among the recently identified predictors of long-term all-cause mortality. [63] But generally, the accuracy of aging prediction by routine clinical chemistries is poor,[64] and for this reason, such markers were omitted from consideration when targeting aging with caloric restriction or exercise. [63,84] In this regard, the methodology for extracting information with predictive value from a set of biomarkers is particularly important. Several mathematical algorithms have been proposed for calculating biological age from multiparameter data, including the multiple linear regression (MLR), the principal component analysis (PCA), and the Klemera and Doubal method. [85] Recently created blood aging clocks based on various machine learning methods have a mean average error ranging between 57 years (Table S1, Supporting Information); these clocks also show high heterogeneity of predictions between human populations. [86,87]

3.4. Hormones

Declines in sex hormones, estrogen, and testosterone (menopause and andropause, respectively) trigger downstream fading effects, such as muscle mass loss and physical frailty. [71] Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its ester metabolite dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) are essential steroid precursors for sex hormones that profoundly decrease from the third decade of life [72] and serve as prospective candidate biomarkers of human aging. [73] The gradual and progressive decline in growth hormone (GH), secreted by the pituitary gland, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), produced mainly in the liver in response to GH, is referred to as the somatopause. These hormones affect insulin secretion and sensitivity in adults,[8] and it has been shown that individuals with exceptional longevity demonstrate decreased levels of systemic GH[74] and IGF-1,[75] and are enriched in gene variants causing disturbance of somatotropic axis.[76] Among hormones of the thyroid gland, low levels of triiodothyronine are associated with an increased risk for morbidity and mortality.[77,78] Age-dependent elevation of circulating metabolic hormones such as adipokines (leptin, adiponectin) are linked to increased risk of metabolic syndrome and mortality in older adults. [79] Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased overall morbidity and cognitive impairment. [77,80] However, some indicators of human aging demonstrate non-linear age-related changes and therefore cannot be interpreted using standard linear regression, which is commonly applied to composite panels of biomarkers. [7] Moreover, certain biomarkers can increase in one tissue and decrease in another at the same time,[88] suggesting that not only people but even different body systems age at different rates. The concept of a biological signature of aging [83] offers potential compromise or alternative ways of using a panel of biomarkers to track individual aging trajectories. Human signatures (i.e., patterns of blood-based biomarker levels) associated with more or less intensive aging and/or increased risk of a specific disease have been found. The main advantage of such an approach is its ability to capture the interdependence between aging and age-associated diseases that would be difficult to reveal using standard regression modeling.

4.correction: 

Many thousands of genes, gene products, epigenetic modifications, and/or metabolites are involved in the aging process. These technologies allow for the identification of distinct aging signatures and have tremendous potential for revealing age-associated changes in the very early stages when significant increases in known biomarkers are not yet observable. The next logical step is to integrate single omics data into one network. However, given the high heterogeneity of omics data and the multifactorial nature of aging, this is not as straightforward as it seems [89, 90]. The robustness of omics-derived results also needs to be taken into consideration. Problems typical to omics-based aging biomarkers include curse of dimensionality (high dimension, low-sample size data), heterogeneity of technologies leading to batch effects, high invasiveness of retrieving samples from some organs, lack of longitudinal data [89, 90].

Organ-specific markers are among the biomarkers identified to assess certain organ dysfunction. Well-known markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure include brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), and cardiac troponin [4]. Cystatin C is a newly established marker of chronic kidney disease that is able to detect renal dysfunction at an earlier stage than serum creatinine [81]. Classical biochemical biomarkers of liver dysfunction include albumin or alkaline phosphatase. ApoE level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a marker of neurodegenerative disease [22]. The potential impact of these medical biomarkers in aging research and long-term risk prediction is yet to be established. For further reading on organ and tissue-specific biomarkers related to aging, we suggest reviews by Engelfriet et al. [8] and Khan et al. [9].

The simultaneous monitoring of various parameters independently associated with aging represents a more robust approach than tracking any single blood-based biomarker [9, 82]. Combined panels of biomarkers have demonstrated significantly better performance than individual ones in predicting future risk [64, 82, 83]. They show better responsiveness to geroprotective intervention, such as calorie restriction [83]. 

Human aging is a very complex trait affected by myriad factors aside from genetic predisposition. The magnitude of genetic contribution to human variation in aging is still debated, varying from around 15% to 30% [91], but probably overestimated due to assortative mating according to a recent suggestion [92]. The population specificity contributes to moderate convergence between research results since genes that affect human aging in one population may not be replicated in another [93].

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful approach to examine the genetic architecture of polygenic traits (such as aging) in the genome. The increasing number of analyzed genomes of the elderly, in particular centenarians, provides insights into the genetic predisposition of exceptional longevity [94-96]. Heritability of longevity (survival beyond the oldest percentiles) increases sharply with survival beyond the age of 90 [97], suggesting the existence of specific gene variants that centenarians share [98]. However, only the APOE (apolipoprotein E protein), FOXO3 (stress-induced transcription factor forkhead box O3), and 5q33.3 (longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3) loci are consistently associated with longer lifespan across studies [99]. These genes are implicated in various aspects of cellular and organismal functioning [100].

The original Horvath clock [106], as well as analogs [107], predict a person's age and risk of mortality and have been validated in several independent cohorts of individuals across the lifespan [108]. These clocks can measure age in many human tissues, although tissue-specific effects exist [104]. Therefore, a specific algorithm is necessary for optimal accuracy in each tissue. The second-generation clock PhenoAge demonstrates better predictive power for a variety of aging outcomes [109]. This was achieved by replacing chronological age with a surrogate measure called phenotypic age, estimated from a set of clinical biomarkers. The most recently presented GrimAge clock further elaborates the phenotypic age concept, combining clinical biomarkers with DNA methylation levels [110]. 

Importantly, epigenetic age may respond relatively rapidly to anti-aging interventions, offering a unique opportunity for validating strategies to delay aging, instead of conducting high-cost and long-term longitudinal trials. Recently, TRIIM (Thymus Regeneration, Immunorestoration, and Insulin Mitigation) treatment with a cocktail of substances comprising human growth hormone, proto-hormone DHEA, and metformin demonstrated epigenetic rejuvenation. It reversed epigenetic age by 2.5 years in a one-year treatment window [111]. Despite these encouraging results, little is known about which aging mechanisms epigenetic clocks reflect and whether the changes in the epgenomic level. A large-scale GWAS study has revealed genomic regions that are implicated in lifespan heritability.[101] The polygenic risk score, which predicts human predisposition to a longer life, is established based on weighted contributions from these relevant genetic variants.[101] However, even such a large-scale GWAS failed to completely explain the magnitude of heritability of both lifespan and longevity, suggesting that further investigations using different populations and ethnic groups are needed. Compared to lifespan, genetic variants that influence health span or disease-free survival have been less studied at the whole-genome significance level. A recently performed GWAS in a relatively large human cohort (n = 300,447) found 12 candidate loci associated with health span.[96] Among them, three single nucleotide polymorphisms located at or near CDKN2B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), LPA (apolipoprotein A), and HLA-DQA1 (leukocyte antigen DQA1) loci were identified, which were previously reported to be associated with the longevity phenotype.[95,102] Surprisingly, gene variants of APOE were not revealed. This is an important example of the differences between the genetic signatures of health span and lifespan or, in other words, between late-life severe diseases leading to death and early age pathological conditions corresponding to human health with age.[96]

4.3 Transcriptomics

The transcriptome is the entirety of RNA transcripts, which can be divided into coding and noncoding RNAs, the latter acting as regulatory elements.[112] Similar to the epigenome, the transcriptome changes significantly during aging.[90] Due to the rise of technologies such as NGS and microarrays (DNA chips), the field of transcriptomics has significantly evolved, making it possible to study gene alterations with age on large sample sets. Transcriptomic studies have already been performed for many types of human cells and tissues, and age-related changes in transcriptome were shown to be highly tissue-specific.[90,113] The first large-scale meta-analysis (n = 14,983) of human whole-blood gene expression revealed a compendium of genes (1497) differentially expressed with chronological age.[114] Identified genes were consistent with well-known aging mechanisms, including dysregulation of transcription and translation, ribosome and mitochondria dysfunction, DNA damage accumulation, immune senescence, and altered metabolism. A principal transcriptomic age predictor was established based on 11,908 significantly expressed genes with the average absolute difference between predicted age and chronological age of 7.8 (Table S1, Supporting Information).

4.2 Epigenomics

Epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation as well as histone methylation and acetylation are highly dynamic processes that occur over the human lifespan and are influenced by environmental and genetic factors.[103] These modifications also change during aging, making them a potential biomarker. While the total DNA methylation level slowly decreases with age, cytosine methylation at specific loci containing CpG dinucleotides (referred to as CpG sites) changes differently with age, becoming both hyper- or hypomethylated in different genomic locations.[104,105] A significant breakthrough in biological age measurement came with the development of well-known epigenetic clocks based on a correlation between chronological age and methylation status of selected CpG sites. Methy- Integrative metabolomics and transcriptomics were later applied to show global metabolic adaptations occurring in epidermal skin during aging.[115] Microarray analysis of the transcriptome was performed on epidermal tissue samples from 24 young and 24 old donors, of which 23 donors of each group were also included in the metabolomics analysis. The study's results revealed age-dependent reduction of coenzyme Q10 levels, as well as altered activity in upper glycolysis and glycerolipid biosynthesis or decreased protein and polyamine biosynthesis.[115] Importantly, the identified compendium of age-dependent genes (1053 transcripts with decreased and 932 transcripts with increased levels) had no significant overlap with reported genes predicted to be involved in aging in humans in other tissues. This indicates that each tissue of our body has its own age-dependent gene expression pattern.

Date.[122] The extremely wide concentration range of plasma proteins (up to 12 orders of magnitude) as well as the presence of highly abundant proteins such as serum albumin, complement factors, and immunoglobulins, which constitute more than 99% of the total protein mass,[123] impede the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers in clinical samples. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics remains the gold standard for protein biomarker screening, yet it lacks throughput in the validation phase.[124] The dynamic range problem could be partly overcome due to the emergence of affinity-based or targeted proteomics technologies. Thus, SOMAscan assay, a Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMHuman sub-proteomes were analyzed by Fleischer and co-workers, who used large genome-wide RNA-seq data from human dermal fibroblasts of 133 individuals aged 1 to 94 years old to reveal a transcriptomic signature of biological age. Their ensemble machine learning method, based on linear discriminant analysis classifiers (i.e., transcriptomic clock), was shown to predict chronological age with a median absolute error of 4 years, outperforming previous epigenetic and transcriptomic age estimators, despite using one to two orders of magnitude fewer samples (Table S1, Supporting Information). The proteomics study of plasma proteins using SOMAscan assay discovered 13 proteins associated with chronological age and n = age-related phenotypes in a cohort of female twins (202), and of these proteins, ten were also replicated in the independent sex-mixed cohort (n = 677). Further validation using RNAseq data (n = 384) gave a total of 11 proteins replicated at the protein level or with consistent association with age at gene expression level. The estimated heritability of these proteins was low to moderate, confirming the proposition that human aging and longevity have only a modest genetic contribution, instead being strongly influenced by environmental factors. The strongest association with age was shown for chordin-like protein 1 (CHRDL1), which is involved in bone morphogenic protein signaling, retinal angiogenesis, and brain plasticity. Levels of CHRDL1 increase in older individuals, correlating with lower cardiovascular risk and higher birth weight (a well-known determinant of aging trajectories), suggesting its potential as a biomarker of healthy aging. Surprisingly, the discovered set of 11 proteins does not include broadly accepted aging biomarkers, such as IL-6 or CRP, which is explainable by insufficient proteome coverage and specificity.

More recently, the first muscle tissue-specific transcriptomic aging clock was proposed by applying supervised machine learning algorithms on gene expression data from young and old healthy donors (Table S1, Supporting Information); several candidate biomarkers of human muscle aging, including those which were not yet studied in this context, were reported.

MicroRNAs (abbreviated miRNAs) are small (from 21 to 23 nucleotides) noncoding RNA molecules that participate in the regulation of gene expression by base pairing to complementary mRNA sequences, triggering mRNA cleavage and translational inhibition. miRNAs-mediated RNA degradation contributes to a lack of concordance between transcript levels and their protein products. Despite being predominant within the cell where they are expressed, miRNAs can also be found circulating in blood serum, urine or saliva, within exosomes/microvesicles or bound to protein or lipoprotein factors. Given their specific functions, which are loosely predictable by their sequence, circulating miRNAs have emerged as novel noninvasive indicators that reflect molecular mechanisms underlying age-related pathologies. In humans, numerous miRNAs have been identified to be up- or down-regulated during aging in whole blood, serum, or PBMCs, and the first microRNA age prediction model based on whole blood microRNA expression profiling has been established. In addition to prognostic usage, miRNA transfection and/or overexpression has utility as a therapeutic strategy for precise attenuation of age-related signaling pathways with potential impacts on human health span and lifespan.

The SOMAscan-based proteomic measurements of 1301 plasma proteins in a population of 240 healthy men and women (22-93 years old) identified growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as the strongest biomarker positively associated with age. The proteomic age predictor was developed based on relative concentrations of 76 proteins that highly correlated with chronological age using elastic net regression models (Table S1, Supporting Information). Continually improving technologies should lead to better age predictors as more proteins become identifiable. The newest study on 2925 plasma proteins from 4263 young adults to nonagenarians (18-95 years old) revealed specific waves of changes in the proteome in the fourth, seventh, and eighth decades of life, and identified a highly accurate plasma proteomic clock consisting of 373 proteins (Table S1, Supporting Information). Besides the blood proteome, other clinical samples can be analyzed. The first broad application of SOMAscan technology to CSF from 90 cognitively healthy donors of different ages revealed 82 age-associated proteins. Most of them were novel biomarkers of aging that are prominently associated with immune system activation or response to injury. Despite the fact that the subjects included in this study were judged to be cognitively normal, the probability remains that some elderly patients could have had undetected, preclinical neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that some of the identified age-correlated biomarkers are instead disease-correlated biomarkers.data using algorithms, which can be used as indicators of normal or pathological biological processes or responses to therapeutic interventions.[141] Examples of digital biomarkers include heart rate variability, sleep duration and quality, physical activity, and social behavior, which can be monitored using wearable devices such as smartwatches or smartphone applications.[142] Digital biomarkers have the potential to provide continuous and objective measurements of health-related parameters, enabling early detection and intervention of age-related diseases. Moreover, they can be used to monitor the efficacy of interventions in real-time and to personalize treatment regimens based on individual needs and responses.[143] However, the validity and reliability of digital biomarkers are still being evaluated, and their integration into clinical practice requires further standardization and validation.[144] Overall, digital biomarkers represent a promising approach for improving the management of age-related diseases and promoting healthy aging.number of corrections to the text:

Data using the device's software and hardware. Depending on the method of signal detection, sensors can be classified into two main groups: physical and biochemical. Physical sensors can measure a number of clinically relevant physiological characteristics, including the temperature of human skin (by digital thermometer), blood pressure (by digital sphygmomanometer), body motion (by gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer), heart rhythms (by wearable electrocardiograph), heart rate (by photoplethysmography device), and blood oxygen levels (by noninvasive pulse oximeter). These measurements complement and can even replace traditional physiological tests. [141]

Biochemical sensors require body fluids for analysis and can be noninvasive in the case of collecting secreted fluids (saliva, tears, sweat, skin interstitial fluids, urine, or stools), or invasive (blood, biopsies), when sampling is performed by penetrating the body through injection or incision. [142] Biochemical sensors provide measurements of pH, blood oxygen saturation, protein concentration, amino acids, lipids, electrolytes and metabolites, hormones, and pathogenic bacteria. The incorporation of automated dosing systems allows not only monitoring biomarker concentration in the body but also automatically controlled drug release, such as in the artificial pancreas device system where a glucose sensor placed under the skin is linked to an insulin infusion pump. [143]

Substantial progress in omics approaches provides an opportunity for more multilayer assessment of aging in humans. [90] Omics-based biomarkers can be equally applicable throughout the human lifespan at all levels of biological organization from single-cell profiling to systemic phenotyping (Figure 2). The advantage of omics approaches over systemic biomarkers is that they help to reveal underlying degenerative processes at the earliest stages when no strong correlation between single molecular biomarkers and associated degenerative processes exists.

Wearable devices with wireless modules are particularly valuable in remote patient monitoring, allowing real-time consultation and immediate medical interventions in life-threatening conditions. They offer advantages over standard functional tests in the clinical setting as they generate continuous data, providing a determination of an individual's behavior in normal settings and longitudinally.

Due to the high dimensionality of omics datasets, the interpretation of results becomes especially important. By applying machine-learning techniques, different age predictors (epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) can be developed. The prediction accuracy of such approaches increases with the increasing number of samples selected for modeling but only up to a limited extent. As already mentioned, people age differently, and their organ systems have different resistance to damage accumulation. Moreover, aging of one system may cause changes in other systems; for example, cardiovascular system decline can contribute to neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, liver and kidney disease, complicating the interpretation of aging progression. If we want to improve biological age modeling, we should consider the personalized system-oriented trajectories of aging or, in other words, we need to formulate criteria for defining a personalized aging profile.

A particular area of interest is the metabolome of long-lived individuals. Cross-sectional metabolome profiling was carried out on humans from age 20 to 90 years old to identify potential markers associated with healthy aging [144]. Another study analyzed serum metabolites from more than 1,000 individuals aged 3-91 years old and identified 14 biomarkers that were significantly associated with chronological age [145]. These biomarkers were related to amino acid metabolism as well as energy metabolism.

Existing groups of biomarkers show distinct preferences for different stages of aging progression (Figure 2). As people age differently, the most accurate way to measure degeneration and predict future outcomes seems to be the use of integrative biomarker-based metrics able to define personalized trajectories of aging or aging profiles. Clinical settings' use of circulating systemic biomarkers, which are typically used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of medical conditions and diseases, is limited due to the labor-intensive and time-consuming modes of detection. Circulating systemic biomarkers, which are more relevant in the later stages of aging progression (Figure 2), are broadly incorporated in current models for biological age assessment and risk prediction. Classical anthropometric measurements, physical and cognitive functionality measurements, together with rising digital biomarkers, complement discrete molecular biomarkers in the evaluation of health at advanced ages.Persons' Aging Profile. Simple accumulation of biomarkers from all types of data (non-molecular, discrete molecular, and omics-pattern) would, if done, yield composite measurements of age-related changes. Genetic markers reflect predispositions to certain aging phenotypes characterized by the prevalence of specific pathological processes and age-related diseases. Nevertheless, there remains a strong influence of environmental factors that limits conclusions that can be made based on personalized genomic analyses. Molecular and cellular biomarkers, which reflect early-stage damage events, may be in demand for assessing cell functionality, albeit their applicability in the 1st generation metrics of aging is limited. The 1st generation metrics estimate biological age using a single dataset type and chronological age. The first version of epigenetic clocks, transcriptomic clocks, facial clocks were developed within this generation. The 2nd generation metrics of aging estimate biological age using a single dataset type, chronological age, and clinical biomarkers such as PhenoAge and GrimAge. Second-generation metrics integrate a single type of omics data with clinically relevant biomarkers and have greater predictive power while reflecting changes in individual health better. Integrative metrics can measure the rate of decline of organ systems rather than the biological age of the body as a whole. These metrics are being replaced by third-generation metrics that appeared in the last several years. Aging Profile is an example of a third-generation metric that estimates the biological age of organ systems by combining a single or multiple dataset types, chronological age, and system-specific sets of clinical and bioanalytical biomarkers (Figure 3). We aim to reveal aging profiles that are rather informative at the young adulthood and midlife stages. But once a person's profile is defined, it may be more reliable to apply predictive models personalized to each type of aging. Of course, this can only be implemented after training models on suitable datasets of appropriate size. Such personalized predictive models would present a powerful, third-generation tool for assessing aging. The authors are grateful to João Pedro de Magalhães and Yujia A. Chan for proofreading the manuscript and providing insightful comments.

To date, and despite intense investigation, there is currently no single biomarker or single set of biomarkers that enable the reliable and accurate measurement of aging progression in humans. Due to the incredibly complex nature of aging, it is very likely that no such biomarker will ever be found. Instead of trying to find new good molecules, we need to focus on developing a new strategy for assessing aging in humans. Our main hopes lie in the area of omics approaches, which potentially cover the widest range of aging-related data. Taking into account the divergence in human aging scenarios, the modeling of personalized trajectories of aging or aging profiles by the integral application of all types of biomarkers will likely be the most accurate way to predict future outcomes and facilitate early stage cellular-based intervention aimed at slowing down aging.
