Introduction: Genetic factors contribute to the variation in human lifespan by approximately 25% (Herskind et al. 1996), a contribution believed to be minimal before age 60 years and most profound from age 85 years onwards (Hjelmborg et al. 2006). Candidate longevity genes encode proteins involved in several biological processes including the insulin-IGF-1 signaling pathway (Christensen et al. 2006), in which the transcription factor forkhead box O3A (Foxo3a) is of key importance.

Summary: Variation in the gene encoding Foxo3a (FOXO3A) has previously been reported to be associated with human longevity. Willcox et al. (2008) first reported on the associations of FOXO3A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with longevity in male Americans of Japanese ancestry (rs2764264 (P-value (P) = 0.0002), rs13217795 (P = 0.0006) and rs2802292 (P < 0.0001)), associations which were subsequently confirmed (with effects pointing in the same direction) in Italian, American (northern and western European ancestry), Chinese, and German populations (Anselmi et al. 2009; Flachsbart et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009; Pawlikowska et al. 2009). These studies reported 6 of 16 tagging SNPs (five specific to males and one to females) (Anselmi et al. 2009), 3 of 16 tagging SNPs (both genders) (Flachsbart et al. 2009), 2 of 16 tagging SNPs (specific to females) (Pawlikowska et al. 2009), and 3 of 3 tagging SNPs (both genders) (Li et al. 2009) to be associated with longevity. Furthermore, two studies reported on the associations of FOXO3A haplotypes with longevity (Anselmi et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009).

Genetic variation in FOXO3A has previously been associated with human longevity. Studies published so far have been case-control studies and hence vulnerable to bias introduced by cohort effects. In this study, we extended the previous findings in the cohorts of oldest-old Danes (the Danish 1905 cohort, N = 1089) and middle-aged Danes (N = 736), applying a longitudinal study design as well as the case-control study design. Fifteen SNPs were chosen to cover the known common variation in FOXO3A. Comparing SNP frequencies in the oldest-old with middle-aged individuals, we found an association (after correction for multiple testing) of eight SNPs; four (rs13217795, rs2764264, rs479744, and rs9400239) previously reported to be associated with longevity and four novel SNPs (rs12206094, rs13220810, rs7762395, and rs9486902) (corrected P-values 0.001-0.044). Moreover, we found an association of the haplotypes TAC and CAC of rs9486902, rs10499051, and rs12206094 (corrected P-values: 0.01-0.03) with longevity. Finally, we present data applying a longitudinal study design; when using follow-up survival data on the oldest-old in a longitudinal analysis, we found no SNPs to remain significant after the correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction).

Studies comparing oldest-old to younger controls have raised concerns about possible cohort effects introducing bias (Beekman et al. 2006; Christensen et al. 2006). In this study, we aimed to add further support and to extend the evidence for a role of FOXO3A in longevity by investigating 15 FOXO3A SNPs covering the knownProcessed text:

The table includes P-values obtained from genotype-based case-control comparison. N represents the number of individuals in the group, OR is the odds ratio, and 95% CI is the 95% confidence interval. NA means not analyzed since no homozygotes (rare genotype) were found. The table assumes a recessive model and a dominant model. The data for males and females are separated, and the PCCG values are listed as uncorrected and corrected. 

To investigate the haplotype structure in more detail, the Plink software's sliding window feature was applied using a window of three SNPs. The haplotype frequencies and P-values from the haplotype frequency-based case-control comparison (PCCH) between middle-aged and oldest old are listed in Supporting Information Table S4, while data that are nominally significant and data that pass correction of multiple testing are shown in Table 3. When correcting for multiple testing, only one window (and two haplotypes) held for correction: window 1 (rs9486902, rs10499051, and rs12206094) haplotypes TAC and CAC were found to be significant for males only (see Table 3). For both genders combined, haplotypes in windows 1, 2, 3, and 4 were found to be nominally significant.

The case-control association analysis of FOXO3A haplotypes with longevity is divided into males and females combined (A) and for males separately (B). The table includes window SNPs in the window, haplotype, uncorrected PCCH, corrected PCCH columns. Only PCCHs being nominally significant (P < 0.05) are included in the table; data passing nominal significance are listed in columns named Uncorrected PCCH. Values passing correction by multiple testing are in bold. N represents the number of individuals in the group.

One hundred and forty-three of the 1089 1905 cohort reached 100 years of age. Because the associations of SNPs with longevity have previously been reported to be significant for centenarians (Flachsbart et al. 2009), we conducted the association studies for the centenarian group separately.

In addition to the case-control setup, we analyzed the follow-up survival data for oldest old. When conducting Cox regression, rs10499051, rs7762395, and rs9486902 were found to be nominally associated with longevity. When correcting for multiple testing by Bonferroni correction, none of the results remained significant.

Numerous genes and variations have been investigated for their contribution to human longevity, and FOXO3A gene is emerging as a convincing longevity candidate gene. This study investigates the possible association of variation in the FOXO3A gene with human longevity by covering the known common genetic variation of FOXO3A using tagging SNPs and analyzing frequency data both by case-control and longitudinal approaches. 

The frequencies of rare alleles and rare genotypes tended to increase in the oldest old when compared to younger controls, except for rs13220810 where the most frequent allele and most frequent genotype were increased in the oldest old. Moreover, as reported by Flachsbart et al., allele and genotype frequencies for nonagenarians in our cohort were generally between frequencies for younger controls and centenarians, supporting an increase in allele and genotype frequencies with age.

The recessive model shows low PGGC values, indicating that association effects may be most pronounced for rare homozygotes giving these individuals a survival advantage. The rs13220810 shows significance only when applying a dominant model, indicating that its positive effect is most pronounced for individuals holding the common allele. Flachsbart et al. (2009) and Li et al. (2009) reported significant findings in populations composed of both genders. However, the differences in allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies in our cohorts were most pronounced for males.The association of SNPs in FOXO3A (Willcox et al. 2008) was investigated in an all-male population. Anselmi et al. (2009) reported five of six SNPs specific to males, while only one was specific to females, indicating a gender effect. In the case-control study, no associations were observed in females even though the sample size was larger than for males. Nominal differences between the oldest old males and male controls were found for five SNPs (rs12206094, rs13220810, rs2802292, rs3800231, and rs9486902), and one SNP (rs479744) was significantly different between centenarians and controls when analyzing both genders combined. All except rs12206094, rs13220210, and rs9486902 have been found to be associated with longevity at the allele level in at least one previous study. The associations point in the same direction as in previously published studies, supporting the findings.

However, at the allelic level, data did not hold after correction for multiple testing, possibly due to lack of power to detect an association. Flachsbart et al. (2009) and Li et al. (2009) reported significant findings in populations composed of both genders, but differences in allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies were found to be most pronounced for males in this study. Haplotypes including rs9486902 and rs12206094 were found to be associated with longevity.

When comparing genotype frequencies, all SNPs except rs10499051, rs12212067, and rs12207868 were nominally significantly associated with longevity. After correction for multiple testing, eight of the 12 SNPs remained significant; two for both genders combined (rs479744 and rs7762395) and eight when analyzing males separately (rs12206094, rs13220810, rs13217795, rs2764264, rs479744, rs7762395, rs9486902, and rs9400239).

The study investigated the association of FOXO3A SNPs in controls compared to the entire group of oldest old and centenarians. The association of FOXO3A SNPs with longevity was previously reported to be most pronounced for centenarians (Flachsbart et al. 2009). However, none of the three SNPs found to be nominally associated with longevity in the longitudinal analysis held significance after correction for multiple testing.

The genomic region investigated in this study is position 108,982,719-109,113,664 of chromosome 6, which corresponds to FOXO3A and 5000 base pairs upstream and 1000 base pairs downstream. Variation data in this gene region were obtained through the HapMap consortium database for the CEPH cohort. The HaploView software was used to analyze genotype SNP data.and males and females separately, adjusted for age, gender, and cohort.No changes needed. The sentence is already correct.
