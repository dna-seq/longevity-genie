Genetic variation in TERT and TERC is associated with human leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and longevity. The minor alleles of rs3772190 (A) and rs12696304 (G) in TERC were negatively correlated with LTL. No associations were observed for the TERT SNPs or haplotypes. Our study indicates that TERC is associated with both LTL and longevity in humans. This was confirmed by a significant increase in minor allele frequency of rs3772190 (A) in centenarians compared to the < 80 age group. The study involved a large sample of 58-100+ year-old Danish individuals. The two major telomerase genes are telomerase RNA component (TERC), encoding the subunit of the enzyme, which provides a template for the synthesis of the TTAGGG repeats, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), encoding its catalytic subunit. Telomere maintenance genes, particularly those that regulate telomerase activity, might also be longevity genes.Mortality analysis did not show any associations (data not shown). A similar evaluation of TERC was not possible because no tagging SNPs were known for Caucasians in the TERC encoding region at the time of conducting this study.

Longevity association study
First, we analyzed the association of the two TERC candidate SNPs with longevity using participants from the UT, LSADT, 1905, and DLCS cohorts (N = 1013). Comparison of allele and genotype frequencies between age groups is presented in Table 1.

Table 2 Regression analysis of LTL by TERC candidate SNP genotypes

Several reports have provided evidence that LTL is associated with an increased risk of age-related disease and mortality in humans (Bakaysa et al., 2007; Kimura et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2011). One puzzling observation was, however, that cross-sectional comparison of genotype frequencies in predefined age groups suggested that the MAF of rs3772190 was significantly increased in the centenarians, in an apparent conflict with the mortality analysis using follow-up data. However, this cross-sectional estimate was based on the rather small sample size of centenarians (127 of 1013 study participants); hence, it might simply be a chance finding. Moreover, repeating the mortality analysis for rs3772190 with exclusion of the centenarian subgroup did not change the results, while performing the mortality analysis of the centenarians separately eliminated the association. Hence, it appears that the centenarian subgroup did not contribute to the mortality risk estimate of follow-up data.

Finally, despite the very thorough examination of the genetic variation in the TERT encoding locus in the present study, we found no evidence for association of TERT SNPs or haplotypes with longevity. Applying both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study approach, we investigated the association of longevity to common genetic variation in TERT by examining the fourMikael Thinggaard contributed by providing data and data cleaning and assisting in establishing and conducting the statistical analysis.

Statistical analysis: Chi-square test statistics were applied for all cross-sectional association studies of genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies using the Plink statistical program (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink; Purcell et al., 2007). Among the subjects genotyped for the TERT and TERC candidate SNPs were 381 intact twin pairs, which could lead to an increased risk of false positive findings because of the non-independence of twin samples. However, repeating all cross-sectional analyses while excluding one arbitrarily chosen twin from each pair completely mirrored the presented findings, thus leading to the same conclusions.

The mortality risk of genotypes in longitudinal data was estimated with STATA 11.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) using a sex-adjusted, left-truncated Cox proportional hazards model to adjust for late entry into the dataset according to age. Because intact twin pairs were included in the study, statistical analyses were performed using the robust estimator of variance, assuming independence between the twin pairs. The proportional hazard assumption was evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals and performing an Aalen linear hazard model, and both suggested a change in effect with age for rs2853668, rs33954691, rs3772190, and rs3891054. Hence, an extended Cox model was performed splitting the effect up into age spans which the Aalen model supported.
