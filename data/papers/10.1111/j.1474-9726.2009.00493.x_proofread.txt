Association of common genetic variation in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway with human longevity has been replicated in two additional Caucasian cohorts, including both males and females: the Cardiovascular Health Study and Ashkenazi Jewish Centenarians. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism in AKT1, rs3803304, was significantly associated with lifespan in a meta-analysis across the three cohorts (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.68-0.89, adjusted P = 0.043). Two intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms in FOXO3A demonstrated a significant lifespan association among women only (rs1935949, OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.15-1.57, adjusted P = 0.0093). These results demonstrate that common variants in several genes in the insulin/IGF1 pathway are associated with human lifespan. Key words: AKT1; FOXO3A; gene; IGF1; longevity; SNP.

Introduction 

Genes in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway affect lifespan in yeast, nematodes, fruit flies and mice (Kuningas et al., 2008). Mutation of genes in this signaling pathway confers greater resistance to oxidative stress and phenotypic characteristics. The insulin/IGF1 pathway was first implicated in aging in Caenorhabditis elegans (Kenyon et al., 1993; Larsen et al., 1995; Morris et al., 1996). Mutation of daf-2, the nematode ortholog of the IGF1 and insulin receptors, results in extended lifespan and increased stress resistance (Kenyon et al., 1993; Kimura et al., 1997); these effects are mediated by the nuclear transcription factor DAF-16, which is a homolog of the mammalian forkhead (FKHRL or FOXO) transcription factors (Ogg et al., 1997). Mutations in age-1, the homolog of mammalian PI3Kinase which is involved in signal transduction from the insulin and IGF1 receptors (Dorman et al., 1995), also increase lifespan in C. elegans. Similarly, in Drosophila mutations of the insulin receptor homolog, its substrate chico (Clancy et al., 2001), and of the daf-16/foxo homolog (Hwangbo et al., 2004).

Summary 

The insulin/IGF1 signaling pathways affect lifespan in several model organisms, including worms, flies and mice. To investigate whether common genetic variation in this pathway influences lifespan in humans, we genotyped 291 common variants in 30 genes encoding proteins in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway in a cohort of elderly Caucasian women selected from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). The cohort included 293 long-lived cases (lifespan > 92 years (y), mean ± standard deviation (SD) = 95.3 ± 2.2y) and 603 average-lifespan controls (lifespan < 79y, mean = 75.7 ± 2.6y). Variants were selected for genotyping using a haplotype-tagging approach. We found a modest excess of variants nominally associated with longevity. Nominally significant variants were then observed in vertebrates, where growth and glucose metabolism are regulated by two parallel pathways with separate receptors for insulin and IGF1. In mice, mutations that result in growth hormone deficiency or mutationsThe most significant association for a three-SNP haplotype comprising rs9292854, rs13182117, and rs4866941 (P = 0.0005, compared with the best single-SNP association of P = 0.007 for rs4866941; analysis not corrected for race/ethnicity), suggests that the putative causative allele resides on this haplotype. For all genes except GHR, haplotypes containing longevity-associated SNPs exhibited a similar effect size and significance level for association with longevity, suggesting that in each case, the putative causative variant was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a single SNP. We selected other variants in the surrounding area from dbSNP. We genotyped eight additional AKT1 SNPs in SOF, including five coding SNPs (one rare, four unvalidated), two synonymous SNPs, and one intronic SNP located 22 bp from an intron-exon junction. Three of these eight SNPs were polymorphic in SOF and none was associated with longevity (Table S1). As no coding SNPs in AKT1 were associated with longevity, we searched for potential regulatory sites in the region (Fig. 2B). AKT1 rs3803304 lies in an intron, 70 bp away from a conserved exon-intron boundary and in an area of high-predicted regulatory potential (0.3 score on the evolutionary and sequence pattern extraction through reduced representations (ESPERR) prediction metric) (King et al., 2005). Data from the Affymetrix Transcriptome Phase 3 gene tiling arrays (Kapranov et al., 2007) show a long (> 200 bp) RNA signal at this intron/exon border encompassing rs3803304 (Fig. 2B); a CpG island is also found here. It is possible that rs3803304 disrupts an RNA regulatory mechanism. Initial SNP discovery in FOXO3A was by sequencing; no other common exonic SNPs were found. The two SNPs most strongly associated with longevity, FOXO3A rs1935949 and rs4946935, lie in intron 3, 1.7 kb from the intron-exon boundary of the 3UTR, but not in an area of evolutionary conservation (Fig. 2D). We observed a borderline effect of sex on the FOXO3A rs1935949 SNP association with longevity, suggesting a stronger effect of female sex (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.52-0.99, P = 0.049), as also seen when comparing the odds ratio for association with longevity between the mixed-sex (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.09-1.41) and female-only subsets (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.15-1.57). When restricted to female subjects, the association of FOXO3A rs1935949 and rs4946935 with longevity in the meta-analysis achieved statistical significance (adjusted P-values were 0.0093 and 0.019 respectively).

Interaction analyses

We included four SNPs in the replication genotyping that were not individually associated with longevity in SOF but had a significant association with longevity in interaction analyses with another SNP. Two IGFBP5 SNPs (rs3770472 and rs11575134) had significant interactions with GHR SNP rs2940935 in SOF (both P < 0.00004); these interactions appeared to replicate in the AJC study (P = 0.012 for rs3770472 and 0.026 for rs11575134), but not in the CHS cohort. SNP rs1009728 was included in the replication genotyping because of a significant interaction with a SNP in PIK3R1, but this latter SNP could not be genotyped in the replication cohorts.

Replication of association of AKT1 and FOXO3A SNPs with longevity

As the case-control associations we observed in SOF were not significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing, we replicated the nominally associated SNPs in two independent Caucasian cohorts, the CHS and AJC. We selected all 21 SNPs individually associated with longevity in SOF (P < 0.05) as well as 4 SNPs significantly associated with longevity (P < 0.001) in 2-SNP interaction analyses for replication genotyping (Table 3). We observed the most consistent results across all three cohorts for 1 SNP in AKT1 (rs3803304), which was nominally associated with longevity in each of the three cohorts, with a consistent effect size (odds ratio, OR) of 0.77-0.79.

Replication of nominally significant findings in independent Caucasian cohorts revealed a SNP in AKT1 that was significantly associated with lifespan, and two SNPs in FOXO3A, which were significantly associated with lifespan in women. Overall, the longevity-associated SNPs were associated with the three major categories (cardiovascular, cancer, and cause of death), suggesting that their association with lifespan is due to a general effect rather than to a specific disease (Table 5). Several previous studies have demonstrated associations between variants in other genes in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway and human aging phenotypes. Most of these studies investigated only a small number of SNPs or genes, and their results have not been replicated. Our study analyzed 291 SNPs in 30 genes, providing the first comprehensive screen of the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway in humans.

Association of genetic variation in AKT1 with human lifespan has not been previously reported; however, several studies have reported associations with FOXOand small insertions-deletions. We did not genotype copy number variants or large insertions-deletions and, with the exception of a few amino acid-coding variants, we only evaluated the effects of common variants (minor allele frequency > 0.05). The relative dearth of common SNPs associated with longevity in the genes we analyzed does not exclude the existence of other genetic effects in the pathway. How the variants we identified affect lifespan remains uncertain. All three longevity-associated SNPs that replicated across three independent cohorts are intronic SNPs of no known function, and they do not reside in motifs conserved through evolution. In the case of FOXO3A, the two longevity-associated SNPs are in LD with other variants across an area of approximately 67 kb (Fig. S1). As the LD is so strong in this case, it is unlikely that these SNPs are tagging rare functional variants. To obtain a complete picture of the association of genetic variation in the insulin/IGF1 pathway with longevity phenotypes, discovery of rare variants by re-sequencing of the same set of candidate genes will be necessary.

In summary, we screened the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway for association with human longevity and identified common variants in two genes, AKT1 and FOXO3A, which are consistently associated with longer lifespan in three independent Caucasian cohorts. Our results extend the remarkably consistent effect of this pathway on lifespan in model organisms to human populations. Although the effects we observed are subtle, they implicate the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway in human aging, confirming that studies in model organisms can help us gain insights into the biology of human aging.

Despite these limitations, replication among three independent Caucasian samples, including a founder population (AJC), strengthens our findings. It is unlikely that population stratification could lead to false-positive results that would be consistent across a European American/Caucasian American population and the Ashkenazi population, as the patterns of stratification would be different. Any birth cohort effects should be relatively modest, as the differences in birth year were small.

Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)

Experimental procedures

The original CHS cohort includes 5201 Caucasian and African American participants recruited from 1989 to 1990 in four communities in the United States (Fried et al., 1991; Tell et al., 1993) and 684 additional African-American participants recruited from 1992 to 1993. All participants were 65 years of age or older. At enrollment, participants were not institutionalized, wheelchair-bound at home, or receiving treatment for cancer. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Deaths were ascertained through surveillance and at semiannual contacts. For all deaths, the CHS collected information from medical records, physician interviews, autopsy reports, coroner reports, and next of kin interviews. Data were reviewed by the CHS Events Committee and cause of death classified according to pre-specified criteria (Ives et al., 1995). From the 4383 Caucasian CHS participants, we defined a case-control replication sample of 1076 for the longevity analysis using the same age cutoffs as in the SOF study. This subset included 279 long-lived cases (lifespan >92 years, mean = 94.5 ± 2.1 years) and 797 average-lifespan controls (lifespan <79 years, mean = 76.1 ± 3.1 years).

Samples

Data from three studies were analyzed. Two are large cohort studies of older adults: SOF and CHS. The third study is a case-control study (AJC).

Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF)

A total of 9704 ambulatory community-dwelling Caucasian women age 65 and older were recruited from September 1986 through October 1988 from four areas in the United States: Baltimore, MD; Monongahela Valley, PA; Minneapolis, MN; and Portland, OR (Cummings et al., 1990). The study protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Self-reported ethnicity was recorded as Northern, Southern, or Central European, or mixed/other. The cohort has been followed for over 20 years with age and cause of death recorded for participants who have died. Eight hundred and ninety-six SOF participants were selected for this study. These included 293 long-lived cases (lifespan >92 years, mean ± SD = 95.3 ± 2.2 years) of whom approximately 56% were still living at the last study visit. We selected 603 controls who were the youngest to die in this cohort (lifespan <79 years, mean = 75.7 ± 2.6 years); however, the age of death in the controls is not substantially different compared to the generalThe given text appears to be a scientific research paper, and it contains several technical terms and abbreviations related to genetics and statistical analysis.

Four percent of controls and 76% of centenarians have died since recruitment. Using http://www.autoprimer.com, primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi), and as previously described (Hsu & Kwok, 2003), assay conditions are available upon request.

Genotyping in AJC was performed at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine using the Sequenom platform and pyrosequencing. Samples were genotyped by investigators blinded to phenotype. All data were scored by at least two investigators. DNA samples were genotyped on 384-well plates with negative and positive controls (duplicates) included on each plate. There were 19 duplicates among the SOF and 267 among the CHS samples. Plates with fewer than 90% successful genotypes or with duplicate discrepancies were repeated. Plates where duplicate discrepancies persisted after re-genotyping were excluded. The overall genotyping accuracy was >99.5%.

Gene and variant selection: Variants were selected for genotyping in 30 genes encoding the key proteins (Figure 1) in the human insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway, including ligands (IGF1, insulin, GH1, GHRH), binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, IGFBP3, IGFBP4, IGFBP5, IGFBP6), receptors (IGF1R, INSR, INSRR, GHR, GHRHR), signal transduction proteins (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, IRS1, IRS2, IRS4, PDPK1, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3R1, PIK3R2, PTEN, SHC1), and transcription factors (AFX, FOXO1A, FOXO3A). GH1 was included initially, but all three SNPs available in dbSNP failed genotyping attempts. Initially, variants in FOXO1A and FOXO3A were identified by sequencing exons, intron-exon boundaries and the promoter in 80 Caucasians and selecting haplotype-tagging variants. Subsequently, we utilized the International HapMap Consortium data from CEU Caucasians (The International HapMap Consortium 2005; Frazer et al., 2007) (http://www.hapmap.org) to select haplotypeAkt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.
