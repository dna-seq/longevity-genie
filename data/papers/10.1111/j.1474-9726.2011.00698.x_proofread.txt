Introduction

The forkhead box class O (FOXO) family of transcription factors is evolutionarily conserved and characterized by the so-called forkhead box DNA-binding domain. In mammals, the FOXO gene family consists of four members: FOXO1, FOXO3A, FOXO4, and FOXO6. These genes are homologous to the dauer formation-16 (daf-16) gene in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Numerous studies have shown that FOXO proteins play an important role in a wide range of normal biological processes, including cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest, stress response, and apoptosis (Burgering & Kops, 2002; Stahl et al., 2002; Accili & Arden, 2004), as well as in diseases like cancer or diabetes mellitus (Furukawa-Hibi et al., 2002; Kato et al., 2006). Furthermore, FOXOs interact with several pathways that regulate cellular survival and aging. Early studies linking daf-16 in C. elegans as a key regulator of the insulin-IGF1 signaling (IIS) pathway (Kenyon, 2005) to extended lifespan (Tissenbaum & Guarente, 2001) demonstrated this.

Following these findings in model organisms, Willcox et al. (2008) recently identified one of the daf-16 homologues, FOXO3A, as a susceptibility gene for human longevity in ethnic Japanese from Hawaii. This association was subsequently replicated in German, Italian, Chinese, US-American, Jewish, and Danish populations. 

Summary

The forkhead box class O (FOXO) family of transcription factors consists of four members: FOXO1, FOXO3A, FOXO4, and FOXO6. The FOXO genes are homologues of daf-16, a key regulator of the insulin-IGF1 signaling pathway and a modulator of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Recently, variants in FOXO3A have consistently been associated with human longevity in various populations worldwide. Given this confirmed finding, it is conceivable that polymorphisms in the other FOXO genes might have a similar effect on human longevity.

To evaluate whether allelic variation in FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 influences the ability to become long-lived, we performed a comprehensive haplotype-tagging analysis of the three genes in a group of 1447 centenarians/nonagenarians and 1029 younger controls from Germany. This is the first investigation to analyze a possible association of human longevity with FOXO4 and FOXO6 and the largest and most comprehensive study to date to assess the genetic contribution of FOXO1 to the phenotype.

Our results suggest that none of the three genes plays a significant role in the ability to reach old age among Germans. With regard to FOXO1, this observation is supported by data from an Italian sample and is consistent with several previous reports but appears to be in contrast to a recent study of Han Chinese. The discordant association findings in Europeans and Chinese may be explained by their different FOXO1 linkage distributions.

Human longevity is considered a multi-factorial phenotype with a genetic contribution of about 25% (Christensen et al., 2006). The genetic component has been shown to become stronger with increasing age of the individuals (Hjelmborg et al., 2006; Gogele et al., 2010). Many genetic factors are likely to be involved, each having only a weak to moderate effect (Christensen et al., 2006). Up to date, the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and variation in FOXO3A remain the only genetic determinants that have consistently and repeatedly been found to influence survival into old age in numerous populations worldwide (Christensen et al., 2006; Willcox et al., 2008; Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; PawSuggesting a female-specific effect (Li et al., 2009), the results of the single-point analysis were replicated in an additional sample of Chinese. However, this finding contrasts with other studies that show no evidence of an association between FOXO1 and human longevity (Bonafe et al., 2003; Kojima et al., 2004; Willcox et al., 2008).

Results:
In this study, we analyzed 36 haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the gene regions of FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 for association with human longevity. The polymorphisms were spaced across the entire genes, covering most of the allelic variation. For none of the SNPs, we found a significant deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control population (P > 0.02). Single-marker comparisons did not show a significant association for any of the tested SNPs, neither for the complete sample of LLI (Table 1) nor for the female (Table 2) or male subgroup (data not shown). A subsequent haplotype-based association analysis using a sliding window with pairs of consecutive SNPs revealed no association in any of the three genes with human longevity (data not shown).

Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 in a large group of 1447 long-lived individuals (LLI), i.e. centenarians and nonagenarians, and 1029 younger individuals.

The study analyzed the association between FOXO gene family members (FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6) and human longevity in German and Italian populations. The study did not find any evidence of an association between FOXO1 variants and human longevity in Germans or Italians. However, two samples of female Han Chinese showed association signals for the FOXO1 SNPs rs2755209 and rs2755213. The study suggests that there may be a continent-specific effect on longevity association with FOXO1 variants. Replications with more extensive DNA collections of, for instance, Japanese origin would be helpful to confirm the Asian- and female-specific longevity association of FOXO1.age: 95.8 years) and 216 younger controls (5064 years, mean age: 59.6 years). The Chinese sample consisted of 402 controls (2069 years) and the Japanese sample consisted of 98 controls (2069 years). The German control group comprised 1010 individuals (6075 years; mean age: 66.8 years). All control individuals were recruited from the same geographic region as the LLI and were free of any known chronic diseases at the time of enrolment. The study was approved by the respective local ethics committees, and all participants gave written informed consent. Table 5 shows the minor allele frequencies of FOXO1 SNPs in German, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese controls.The study analyzed 81 Southern Italian centenarians (mean age: 98.39 years) and 216 younger controls (mean age: 31.06 years) obtained from the Southern Italian Centenarian Study (SICS), enrolled by Associazione Longevita` (Anselmi et al., 2009). The demographic and clinical characteristics of SICS LLI were thoroughly investigated, and all subjects gave written informed consent to the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Multimedica, Milano, Italy.

The associated SNPs from Li et al. (2009) are in bold. "miF" stands for minor allele frequency, and "NA" means that no information is available. Data from Li et al. (2009) and Kojima et al. were used to determine that SNP rs2297626 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs17630266 (r2 = 0.95, using JPT HapMap data). Genotyping of the German samples was performed using the SNPlexTM Genotyping System and TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (both Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on an automated platform (Hampe et al., 2001). For quality control purposes, positive controls on each genotyping plate were checked for consistency. All SNPs were tested for deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the call rate for each marker exceeded 95.8%.

The LD structure of FOXO1 in Germans (A), Italians (B), Chinese (C), and Japanese (D) was analyzed using single-nucleotide polymorphisms used in the study of Chinese individuals by Li et al. (2009), based on linkage disequilibrium plots generated with Haploview using HapMap data of Han Chinese (CHB) and Japanese (JPT) as well as data of German and Italian control individuals from this study.

Genotyping of SICS individuals was carried out with the Infinium II Assay-HumanHap 317K duo BeadChip system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using standard protocols. Individual samples and markers showing a genotyping rate lower than 93% and 95%, respectively, were excluded. Imputation of unobserved genotypes was performed using Impute, version 0.5 (Marchini et al., 2007) with the HapMap CEU release 24 reference panel (http://www.hapmap.org/).

Further studies are needed to clarify in more detail the in vivo roles of the FOXO genes, particularly FOXO3A, in human longevity.

Genet., Statistical analysis: Haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) of FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 were selected based on the HapMap genotypes of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU; http://www.hapmap.org/) and the pairwise tagging option implemented in the Haploview v3.32 program (Barrett et al., 2005) (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/) (minor allele frequency: > 0.05, pairwise r2 > 0.8, P > 0.01; see Table 1 for htSNPs HWE). The exact genomic regions for the selection of the htSNPs were as follows: for FOXO1 chromosome 13: 40,022,274-40,144,279; for FOXO4 X chromosome: 70,227,715-70,245,118; and for FOXO6 chromosome 1: 41,596,756-41,624,373 (all NCBI36).
