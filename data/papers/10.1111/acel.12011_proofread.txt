Common genetic variants of the β2-adrenergic receptor affect its translational efficiency and are associated with human longevity. Ling Zhao, Fan Yang, Ke Xu, Huiqing Cao, Gu-Yan Zheng, Yan Zhang, Jianxin Li, Hanbin Cui, Xiaomin Chen, Zhiming Zhu, Hongbo He, Xianming Mo, Brian K. Kennedy, Yousin Suh, Yi Zeng and Xiao-Li Tian conducted a 10-year follow-up study of the Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey to test whether genes encoding key components of the β-adrenergic signaling pathway are associated with human longevity. They selected and genotyped 16 SNPs from ADRB1, ADRB2, ADCY5, ADCY6, and MAPK1 genes. Two SNPs (rs1042718 and rs1042719) of ADRB2 in linkage disequilibrium (D = 1.0; r2 = 0.67) were found to be associated with enhanced longevity in men in two geographically isolated populations. Bonferroni-corrected P-values in a combined analysis were 0.0005-0.0010. Men with haplotype A-C showed an increased probability of becoming centenarians (the frequency of A-C in long-lived and young individuals is 0.332 and 0.250 respectively; OR = 1.49; CI 95% = 1.17-1.88; P = 0.0007), in contrast to those with haplotype C-G (the frequency of C-G in long-lived and young individuals is 0.523 and 0.635 respectively; OR = 0.63; CI 95% = 0.51-0.78). ADRB2 encodes the β2-adrenergic receptor. The haplotype A-C markedly reduces its translational efficiency compared with C-G (P = 0.002) in transfected HEK293 cells. Thus, the data indicate that enhanced production of β2-adrenergic receptors caused by genetic variants is inversely associated with human lifespan. The β-adrenergic signaling pathway is critical to the regulation of vascular tone, cell growth and apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and the immune response. Therefore, it is clinically one of the most common pharmacological targets for treating various cardiovascular diseases and asthma. Because of their protective effects from various types of cardiovascular stresses, beta-receptor blockage was hypothesized to increase longevity (Milne & Hong, 2004). In support, it was recently demonstrated that mice lacking ADCY5, encoding type 5-adenylyl cyclase (AC5), are stress-resistant and experience a 30% increase in median lifespan (Yan et al., 2007). AC5 is a member of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) family that is activated by β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) and is responsible for the production of cAMP in vivo (Roth et al., 2002). Null function of AC5 blocks the signaling transduction of βARs. On the other hand, transgenic mice engineered to overexpress a β2AR in cardiac tissue have reduced lifespan, with males displaying a more dramatic phenotype (Gao et al., 2003). These findings establish a role for βAR signaling in mammalian longevity regulation and also suggest that this pathway may underscore sexual dimorphic features of this complex phenotype. However, a role for βAR signaling in human longevity remains to be established, and it is important to address this question because β-adrenergic agonists and antagonists are widely used in treating various human diseases.incorrectly combined word "b-adrenergic" should be split into "beta-adrenergic".

Longevity was replicated in population 2 (stage 2) (P = 0.003-0.011, Table 2). When two populations were combined, the P-values and statistical powers for rs1042718 and rs1042719 became (P/power) 0.00079/0.74 and 0.00011/0.85. The Bonferroni-corrected P-values were 0.012 and 0.0018, respectively. Quantitative trait analysis demonstrated that SNPs rs1042718 and rs1042719 of ADRB2 did not exhibit any correlation with BMI, systolic or diastolic blood pressures in either the oldest-old or their young-matched subjects (Fig. S3, Supporting information). Gender effects on MAFs of SNPs To eliminate gender effects on the distributions of MAFs, we compared the MAFs of SNPs between the oldest-old and control groups within gender using the chi-square test. We found that the MAFs of rs1042718 and rs1042719 from ADRB2 were only elevated in men (the Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.0005-0.01; statistical power = 0.92-0.93, Table 3) but not in female centenarians compared with their young counterparts (P = 0.091-0.102; Table S4, Supporting information). The interactions between genders and SNPs were then tested; the P-values for interaction were 0.07 and 0.019 for rs1042718 and rs1042719, respectively, as shown in Table S5 (Supporting information). Genotyping and single SNP association study Sixteen SNPs were selected from ADRB1, ADRB2, ADCY5, ADCY6, and MAPK1 from the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway (Fig. S2, Supporting information). As a first step, the 16 SNPs were genotyped by directly sequencing the amplified genomic DNA from 96 centenarians and 96 young individuals from population 1 (Table S1, Supporting information) with the listed PCR primers (Table S2, Supporting information). None of the SNPs were found to depart from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations (Table S3, Supporting information). The distributions of minor allele frequencies (MAFs) between case and control groups were Enrichment of MAF in groups with increased death ages To test whether the MAFs of SNPs, rs1042718 and rs1042719 of ADRB2, were enriched with increased age of mortality, we calculated the MAFs of the two SNPs in four male groups: (i) young group (living subjects; life expectancy was reported as 71.3 years for men in China in 2009); (ii) death age = 95; (iii) death ages from 96 to 100; and (iv) death ages >100. One-way ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparisons were used to test the differences between groups. It was found that the MAFs of the two SNPs were significantly increased with age of mortality (Fig. 1 and Table S6, Supporting information). Genotypic association analysis To determine through which inheritance models rs1042718 and rs1042719 of ADRB2 were associated with the longevity trait, a genotypic association test was performed under dominant, recessive, and additive models by logistic regression in the combined analysis. We found that rs1042718 and rs1042719 were strongly associated with male longevity in both dominant (P = 0.00001-0.003) and additive models (P = 0.00001-0.001; Table 4). Association signals were relatively weak in recessive model (P = 0.008-0.017). The marginal P-values for the associations were also observed in women (Table 4). Linkage disequilibrium and haplotypic association analysis Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype blocks were defined by r2 (> 0.6) and visualized by the solid spine of LD method (lower panel in Fig. 2). The common haplotypes (frequency <5%) were analyzed for an association with longevity. Three haplotypes, C-G, C-C, and A-C, formed by rs1042718 and rs1042719 of ADRB2 were thus selected and tested in a combined analysis (338 male cases and 460 male controls). The frequency of haplotype C-G was decreased (the frequency of CG is 0.523 and 0.635 in cases andExonic SNPs affect protein production by influencing RNA stability. To test whether the two SNPs were able to alter the translational efficiency of ADRB2, we respectively cloned the ADRB2 coding regions that harbored the three common haplotypes (C-G, C-C, and A-C) formed by rs1042718 and rs1042719 and fused each with the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2). To exclude interferences from other SNPs on an expression assay, we uniformly used the major allele for rs1042713, rs1042714, and rs1042717 in each construct (Fig. 2). The expression vectors were independently transfected into HEK293A cells. Renilla luciferase was used to assess the transfection efficiency. As the only differences among the three fused genes are caused by haplotypic structures, the total translational activity is solely dependent on the respective haplotypes and measured by the ratio of firefly to Renilla luminescence. Therefore, this system accurately assesses the effects of haplotypes on translational efficiency (Tranque et al., 1998). We found that the haplotype A-C led to a reduction in translation efficiency compared with C-G (P = 0.002; Fig. 2). The resulting protein level from the fused gene that carried C-C was closer to that of C-G and marginally different from that of A-C (P = 0.059). The correlations between expression levels and ORs were shown in Fig. 2.

Here, we assessed the genetic contribution of bAR signaling system to the human longevity trait in Han Chinese long-lived and younger individuals. The average lifespan in China was 71 and 74 years of age for men and women, respectively. Thus, those who were at the ages of 95 or above were considered as the long-lived, and middle-aged groups were taken as controls. The SNPs selected from ADRB1, ADRB2, ADCY5, ADCY6, and MAPK1 were genotyped and evaluated for their association with the longevity trait. We identified two synonymous SNPs of ADRB2 (rs1042718 and rs1042719) that were significantly associated with longevity in men through dominant and additive models. Despite the fact that no positive signals were observed in women in the allele association study, we noticed that these two SNPs exhibited marginal P-values in genotypic association in women. This may suggest that the effect size in women is smaller than in men. The association with male longevity was replicated in two geographically isolated Han Chinese populations. The MAFs of the two SNPs were increased with the death ages, providing additional support for the association. In further studies, we demonstrated that the haplotype formed by these two SNPs, which increased the probability of becoming a centenarian, also led to decreased protein production of b2AR. In contrast, overproduction of b2AR is associated with decreased male lifespan. The other SNPs analyzed were not found to be associated with human longevity in the studied populations. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that ADRB2 is linked to human longevity and that a suppression of b2AR production may have beneficial effects on lifespan.

Discussion

Longevity is a complex trait affected by both genetic and environmental factors (Herskind et al., 1996; Li et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2010). A great effort has been made to assess to what extent genetics contributes to the trait over the past decades. For instance, a Danish twin-based study indicated that the heritability of longevity was about 0.33 and 0.44 for men and women, respectively (Herskind et al., 1996). A recent meta-analysis of four GWAS identified 273 SNPs associated with longevity at low P-values (< 0.0001) (Newman et al., 2010).

Used to avoid any possible interference, translational efficiency was measured by firefly luciferase activity. Transfection efficiency was standardized by reference to Renilla luciferase activity resulting from the parallel introduction of this plasmid into the test cells.
