Summary:
The aim of this study was to identify mechanisms that contribute to healthy aging by studying the loci that contribute to human longevity. For this purpose, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted comparing 403 unrelated nonagenarians from long-living families included in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and 1670 younger population controls. The strongest candidate SNPs from this GWAS were analyzed in a meta-analysis of nonagenarian cases from the Rotterdam Study, Leiden 85-plus study and Danish 1905 cohort. Only one of the 62 prioritized SNPs from the GWAS analysis (P < 1 × 10^-4) showed genome-wide significance with survival into old age in the meta-analysis of 4149 nonagenarian cases and 7582 younger controls [OR = 0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.77), P = 3.39 × 10^-17]. This SNP, rs2075650, is located in TOMM40 at chromosome 19q13.32 close to the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Although there was only moderate linkage disequilibrium between rs2075650 and the ApoE e4 defining SNP rs429358, we could not find an APOE-independent effect of rs2075650 on longevity, either in cross-sectional or in longitudinal analyses. As expected, rs429358 associated with metabolic phenotypes in the offspring of the nonagenarian cases from the LLS and their partners. In addition, we observed a novel association between this locus and serum levels of IGF-1 in women (P = 0.005). In conclusion, the major locus determining familial longevity up to high age as detected by GWAS was marked by rs2075650, which tags the deleterious effects of the ApoE e4 allele. No other major locus was found.

Introduction:
The increase in mean life expectancy worldwide in the past two centuries is mainly due to environmental factors such as improved hygiene, nutrition, and health care. However, the large variation in healthy lifespan among the elderly has prompted research into the determinants of aging and lifespan regulation. The genetic contribution to human lifespan variation was estimated at 25-30% in twin studies. The most prominent genetic influence is observed in families in which the capacity to attain a long lifespan clusters. Exceptional longevity can be reached with a low degree of age-related disability, raising the question whether protective mechanisms against disease exist in long-lived subjects.

Methodology:
The Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) families offer a route to identify genetic variants that influence human longevity. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed comparing nonagenarian siblings from the LLS and younger population controls. Emerging candidate SNPs were subsequently investigated in nonagenarian cases from the Rotterdam Study, the Leiden 85-plus study, and the Danish 1905 cohort.

Results:
A GWAS was performed in nonagenarian participants from the LLS and middle-aged controls from the Rotterdam Study (RS). Genotype data for 516,721 SNPs that passed quality control thresholds were analyzed in a comparison of 403 unrelated nonagenarians (94 years on average) and 1670 controls (58 years on average). None of the SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10^-8). Hypothesis-free genome-wide approaches have also been undertaken. Genome-wide linkage scans reported evidence for linkage with longevity on chromosome 4q25, 3p24-22, 9q31-34.12q24 (Boyden & Kunkel, 2010). However, the evidence for these loci is still very weak as the results obtained in centenarians and their families could not be replicated in nonagenarian sibling pairs (Beekman et al., 2006) or have yet to be tested in other studies. A meta GWAS of survival to 90 years or older in 1836 cases and 1955 controls did not find any significant genome-wide associations (Newman et al., 2010). Thus far, hypothesis-free approaches have not identified any loci involved in longevity.

Replication studies: We prioritized the SNPs that had the most significant association with survival into old age according to the analysis of stage 1 (P < 1 x 10^-4, Table S1). For 58 of the 62 selected SNPs, successful genotyping was obtained in the replication cohorts. In stage 2, these 58 SNPs were tested for association comparing 960 RS replication cases (mean age of 93 years), 1208 Leiden 85-plus replication cases (mean age of 92 years), and 1578 Danish replication cases (mean age of 93 years) with appropriate middle-aged population controls (Table 1). Meta-analysis for the 58 SNPs, comprising a total of 4149 nonagenarian cases and 7582 younger controls (from the LLS GWAS, RS replication, Leiden 85-plus replication, and Danish replication studies), was performed.

In a few studies, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish Centenarian Study and the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS), different generations of long-lived families are being investigated for parameters and pathways contributing to the longevity phenotype (Atzmon et al., 2004; Schoenmaker et al., 2006). The survival benefit of the LLS families is marked by a 30% decreased mortality risk in the survival analysis of three generations, i.e., the parents of the probands in this study (nonagenarian sibling pairs), their unselected additional siblings, and their offspring (Schoenmaker et al., 2006). As compared to their partners, the offspring of Rs2075650 on chromosome 19 was the only SNP that was associated with survival into old age at the genome-wide significance level (P = 3.39 x 10^-17) (Table S2A).

The remaining 57 SNPs did not show genome-wide significant effects on longevity either in men or women (Table S2B for men and S2C for women). The association of rs2075650 with survival did show some heterogeneity across the four studies (P = 0.0495), which is mainly because of the RS. We observed only moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) between rs2075650 and rs429358 (r^2 = 0.553) and low LD between rs2075650 and rs7412 (r^2 = 0.014) when analyzing all samples with genotype data of rs2075650, rs429358, and rs7412 (n = 8946). Nevertheless, in a conditional analysis with rs429358 and rs7412 (Model 1, described in the Experimental procedures section), rs2075650 was no longer associated with longevity [OR =Present in the AlzGene database [http://www.alzgene.org/, (Bertram et al., 2007)], we analyzed the effect of 751 measured Alzheimer's disease SNPs on survival into old age in the LLS GWAS. Apart from rs2075650, none of the SNPs showed a significant association after adjustment for multiple testing (Table S4). Analysis of FOXO3A and AKT1 SNPs revealed that, apart from APOE, two other genes have shown consistent evidence for association with longevity, FOXO3A (Willcox et al., 2008; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2010) and AKT1 (Pawlikowska et al., 2009). For the longevity-promoting FOXO3A SNPs previously reported with centenarian longevity, we observed no association with survival into old age in our nonagenarians (Table S5). For AKT1, one of the two measured SNPs, rs2498804, showed a significant association with survival into old age [OR = 0.75 (95% CI 0.63-0.89), P = 0.001] (Table S5).

Discussion

To identify common SNPs contributing to longevity, we performed GWAS analysis of 403 nonagenarian cases and 1670 population controls. Of the 62 top associating SNPs, we identified one SNP, rs2075650, that associated significantly with survival into old age (P = 3.39 × 10^-17). Carriers of the minor allele had a 29% decreased probability of reaching 90 years on average. Although cases and controls originate from different generations, we concluded that there was no substructure to an extent that would affect the observations.

Rs2075650 is located in the TOMM40 gene at chromosome 19q13.32 close to and centromeric of the APOE gene (Fig. S2), which has shown consistent evidence for association with longevity (Schachter et al., 1994; Christensen et al., 2006). The ApoE protein has three isoforms (ApoE e2, ApoE e3, and ApoE e4) that are defined by two SNPs, rs7412 (Arg136Cys; e2) and rs429358 (Cys112Arg; e4). ApoE e4 carriers have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease, while ApoE e2 carriers are protected from these diseases (Corder et al., 1993; Eichner et al., 1993; Christensen et al., 2006). Although we detected only moderate LD (r^2 = 0.553) between rs2075650 and the ApoE e4-defining SNP rs429358, we could not detect a significant effect of rs2075650 on longevity independent of rs429358.

Several prospective studies, including one with the Danish 1905 cohort (Jacobsen et al., 2010), reported increased mortality for ApoE e4 carriers, even though there is still much debate about APOE being a frailty gene or a longevity gene (Gerdes et al., 2000; Christensen et al., 2006; Ewbank, 2007; Jacobsen et al., 2010). The prospective data in the LLS and Leiden 85-plus study support the frailty gene hypothesis, as rs429358 affects mortality after 85 years and continues the effect after 90 years [HR = 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13), P = 0.001 and HR = 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.12), P = 0.001, respectively] (Table S3B, Fig. S4). In these prospective studies, carriers of the minor allele of rs2075650 showed no increased mortality independent of rs429358, which indicates that the association of rs2075650 with longevity is most likely due to variation in the APOE gene.

Although GWAS studies have reported significant associations between rs2075650 and Alzheimer's disease, brain imaging, total cholesterol, and CRP plasma levels (Reiner et al., 2008; Aulchenko et al., 2009; Seshadri et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2010), no analyses were performed to determine whether these associations are APOE independent. We observed no APOE-independent effect on the phenotypes investigated in the LLS offspring and partners except for total and LDL cholesterol.

The strength of this study is that, by using a GWIn the first sentence, "controls" should be "centenarians." In the second sentence, "repli- cated" should be "replicated." The third sentence needs a space between "com-" and "pared." In the fourth sentence, "Alzheimers" should have a possessive apostrophe and be "Alzheimer's." In the fifth sentence, "iden- tified" should be "identified." In the sixth sentence, "and 1989" should be removed. In the seventh sentence, "whole-genomeexome" should be split into "whole-genome" and "exome." In the eighth sentence, "merited" should be "warranted." In the ninth sentence, "Lei- den" should be split into "Leiden." In the tenth sentence, "com- prises" should be "comprises." In the eleventh sentence, there is an unnecessary hyphen in "ophthalmo- logical." In the twelfth sentence, there is a missing space between "RS repli-" and "cation cases." Finally, in the last sentence, there is an unnecessary space after the word "using."

Cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes as young centenarians (Beekman et al., 2010), we expected to primarily find longevity-promoting alleles. However, although most of the 58 prioritized SNPs (n = 43) from the LLS GWAS showed a longevity-promoting effect ranging from 36 to 168%, none of them could be replicated in additional study populations of nonagenarian singletons. The only replicated locus is APOE, which is a mortality locus that has previously been reported to be the major locus responsible for Alzheimer's disease (Harold et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2009; Seshadri et al., 2010), a well-known age-related disease. Nevertheless, none of the other Alzheimer's disease loci showed an association with survival to 90 years, which indicates that the remaining genetic variation in longevity in the LLS could not be explained by the genetic variation which contributes to Alzheimer's disease. In addition to APOE, we also observed evidence for association at the previously reported AKT1 locus (Pawlikowska et al., 2009) with survival into old age in the LLS GWAS, although the effect of this SNP is relatively small (25% decreased probability of becoming 90 years) compared to the effect of rs429358 (51%). The previously reported longevity-promoting effect of the FOXO3A locus could not be replicated in this study. This is probably due to the relatively low number of centenarians in the LLS GWAS case group, in which the effect of SNPs in FOXO3A on longevity seems to be most prominent. The still unexplained genetic variation in longevity might be attributable to rare variants or variants with small effects, which has previously been reported for other complex traits, such as Alzheimer's disease. These loci could not be identified in this study because of the relatively small number of cases in the LLS GWAS, the heterogeneity of factors influencing lifespan within populations, and the difference in the design of the studies used for replication. One way to identify variants with small effects would be to increase the initial sample size of the GWAS study and perform replication in other studies of nonagenarians. Given the higher heritability of longevity at older ages (Tan et al., 2004), one may also limit the study population. Between 1987 and 1989, 673 subjects aged 85 years and older were enrolled in a prospective study (Cohort 1). Between 1997 and 1999, 563 subjects were enrolled in the month of their 85th birthday with follow-up (Cohort 2). Subjects were visited at their home, and there were no exclusion criteria related to health. DNA was available from the combined cohorts consisting of 1208 subjects aged 85 years and older (Leiden 85-plus replication cases). Variants with small effects, rare variants with large effects might play a role in longevity. By whole-genome exome sequencing of long-lived subjects and their families, rare variants can be identified and associated with human longevity. In conclusion, we have shown that the deleterious effect of the ApoE e4 allele, tagged by rs2075650, is the single major hit in our GWAS study for longevity, indicating that no other major longevity locus was present among these nonagenarians. We confirmed the previously reported associations of the ApoE e4 allele with lipid metabolism parameters and report an additional effect on IGF-1 signaling in women. To identify genetic variants with smaller and protective effects on human lifespan, a meta-GWAS for longevity with ayears, 21% of the LLS siblings, 45% of the Leiden 85-plus participants, and 38% of the Danish 1905 cohort had died. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the association between rs2075650 and rs429358 and mortality, with adjustment for age and sex. The genotypes of rs2075650 and rs429358 were coded as 0 (homozygous for the common allele), 1 (heterozygous), or 2 (homozygous for the rare allele). Hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. A meta-analysis was performed by combining the results from the three studies using a fixed-effect model. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using R version 2.12.2 (http://www.r-project.org/).In the first sentence, "sup- ported" should be corrected to "supported". In the second sentence, "Lon-" should be corrected to "Longevity". In the third sentence, "NESDA" should not be split across two lines. In the fourth sentence, "STATASE" should be corrected to "Stata". In the fifth sentence, "Authors" should not be duplicated. In the sixth sentence, "Longevity" should not be split across two lines. In the seventh sentence, "GWAS" should not be split across two lines. 

In the eighth paragraph, there are several duplicated references that need to be removed. In addition, there is a typo in the reference for Cochran (1940), where "v  tests" should be corrected to "T tests".
