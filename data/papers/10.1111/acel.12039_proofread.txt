We calculated non-parametric linkage scores over the whole genome for the three 2013 The Authors Aging Cell 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great and Ireland. When we consider the genes in the 1-LOD drop intervals of the linkage analysis as candidate No significant association (p-value <8.7 x 10-7) was observed at the loci at chromosome 14q11.2.
