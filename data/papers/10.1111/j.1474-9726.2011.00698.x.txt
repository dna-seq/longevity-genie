Introduction

The forkhead box class O (FOXO) family of transcription factors is evolutionarily conserved and characterized by the so-called forkhead box DNA-binding domain. In mammals, the FOXO gene family consists of four members: FOXO1, FOXO3A, FOXO4, and FOXO6, which are homologous to the dauer for- mation-16 (daf-16) gene in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Numerous studies have shown that FOXO proteins play an important role in a wide range of normal biological pro- cesses, including cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest, stress response, and apoptosis (Burgering & Kops, 2002; Stahl et al., 2002; Accili & Arden, 2004), as well as in diseases like cancer or diabetes mellitus (Furukawa-Hibi et al., 2002; Kato et al., 2006). Furthermore, FOXOs interact with several pathways that regu- late cellular survival and aging, as it was demonstrated by early studies linking daf-16 in C. elegans as a key regulator of the insulin-IGF1 signaling (IIS) pathway (Kenyon, 2005) to extended lifespan (Tissenbaum & Guarente, 2001). Following on from these findings in model organisms, Willcox et al. (2008) have recently identified one of the daf-16 homologues, FOXO3A, as a susceptibility gene for human longevity in ethnic Japanese from Hawaii (Willcox et al., 2008). This association was subsequently replicated in German, Italian, Chinese, US-American, Jewish, and Danish populations (Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2010).

Summary

In mammals, the forkhead box class O (FOXO) family of transcription factors consists of the four members FOXO1, FOXO3A, FOXO4, and FOXO6. The FOXO genes are homo- logues of daf-16, a key regulator of the insulin-IGF1 signaling pathway and a modulator of lifespan in Caenor- habditis elegans. Recently, variants in FOXO3A have consistently been associated with human longevity in various populations worldwide. Given this confirmed finding, it is conceivable that polymorphisms in the other FOXO genes might have a similar effect on human longev- ity. To evaluate whether allelic variation in FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 influences the ability to become long- lived, we performed a comprehensive haplotype-tagging analysis of the three genes in a group of 1447 centenari- ans⁄nonagenarians and 1029 younger controls from Ger- many. This is the first investigation to analyze a possible association of human longevity with FOXO4 and FOXO6, respectively, and the largest and most comprehensive study to date to assess the genetic contribution of FOXO1 to the phenotype. Our results suggest that in Germans, none of the three genes plays a significant role in the abil- ity to reach old age. With regard to FOXO1, this observa- tion is supported by data from an Italian sample and is consistent with several previous reports, but appears to be in contrast to a recent study of Han Chinese. The dis- crepant association findings in Europeans and Chinese may be explained by their different FOXO1 linkage dis-

Human longevity is considered a multi-factorial phenotype with a genetic contribution of about 25% (Christensen et al., 2006). The genetic component has been shown to become stronger with increasing age of the individuals (Hjelmborg et al., 2006; Go¨gele et al., 2010). Many genetic factors are likely to be involved, each having only a weak to moderate effect (Christen- sen et al., 2006). Up to date, the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and variation in FOXO3A remain the only genetic determinants that have consistently and repeatedly been found to influence survival into old age in numerous populations worldwide (Christensen et al., 2006; Willcox et al., 2008; Ansel- mi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Paw- likowska et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2010).

polymorphisms (SNPs) in the other FOXO members, which are also regulated by the IIS pathway, might have a similar effect on the phenotype. Previously, an analysis of FOXO1 in the prospec- tive population-based Leiden 85+ study revealed for carriers of a particular 3-SNP haplotype a 1.14-fold increased all-cause mor- tality risk (P value = 0.021, without correction for multiple test- ing) (Kuningas et al., 2007). More recently, statistically significant frequency differences for two SNPs and two haplo- types in FOXO1 were reported between long-lived and younger women from China, suggesting a female-specific effect (Li et al., 2009). The results of the single-point analysis were repli- cated in an additional sample of Chinese. However, this finding is in contrast to other studies showing no evidence for an associ- ation of FOXO1 with human longevity (Bonafe et al., 2003; Koj- ima et al., 2004; Willcox et al., 2008).

Results

In this study, 36 haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the gene regions of FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 were analyzed for asso- ciation with human longevity. The polymorphisms were spaced across the entire genes, covering the majority of the allelic varia- tion. For none of the SNPs, a significant deviation from Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was found in the control popula- tion (P > 0.02). Single-marker comparisons did not show a significant association in any of the tested SNPs, neither for the complete sample of LLI (Table 1) nor the female (Table 2) or male subgroup (data not shown). A subsequent haplotype- based association analysis using a sliding window with pairs of consecutive SNPs revealed no association in any of the three genes with human longevity (data not shown).

Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 in a large group of 1447 long-lived individu- als (LLI, i.e. centenarians and nonagenarians) and 1029 younger

The markers used for the FOXO1 haplotype analysis in the Leiden 85+ study (Kuningas et al., 2007) were also sub- jected to a haplotype analysis in our sample (rs2721069, rs4943794, and rs7981045; Fig. 1A).

Recently, association signals for the FOXO1 SNPs rs2755209 and rs2755213 were reported in two samples of female Han Chinese (Li et al., 2009). In Germans, the frequencies of the polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the LLI and the young controls, neither for the complete sample (Table 1) nor the female subgroup (Table 2). When we investigated an additional population of female Italians for the same SNPs, this analysis did neither show evidence of association (Table 3).

Discussion

In the present study, we performed comprehensive haplotype tagging of the FOXO gene family members FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 in an extensive collection of LLI and younger controls, comprising altogether 2476 German individuals. This is the first investigation to analyze a possible association between FOXO4 or FOXO6, respectively, and human longevity, and the largest

Table 5). A comparison of the two SNPs reveals a comparable increase in their minor allele frequencies in controls relative to LLI (2.9% in Japanese (Kojima et al., 2004) and 4.4% in Chinese (Li et al., 2009). In Japanese, this difference is not significant, which may be because of the relative small sample size used in that study (122 centenarians and 122 controls). Also the other two FOXO1 SNPs of Li et al. (2009) show similar allele frequen- cies in both Chinese and Japanese (Table 5), which raises the intriguing possibility of a continent-specific effect. This observa- tion is underscored by the notable differences in LD structure and allele⁄haplotype distribution between European and Asian populations [Tables 4 and 5, Fig. 2 and HapMap data (Consor- tium 2003)]. Therefore, although our study did not show any evidence for an association of FOXO1 variants with human lon- gevity in Germans and Italians, this does not exclude an effect that could be restricted to Chinese or Asians. Longevity in differ- ent populations is likely to be influenced by varying sets of inter- acting genetic and environmental factors (e.g. diet) (Caliebe et al., 2010). To confirm the Asian- and female-specific longevity association of FOXO1, replications with more exten- sive DNA collections of, for instance, Japanese origin would be helpful.

and most comprehensive one to date to assess the genetic con- tribution of FOXO1 to the phenotype (1886 German and 382 Italian females). Our overall result suggests that polymorphisms in none of the genes have a significant influence on a person’s ability to reach old age.

For FOXO1, several longevity association studies have previ- ously been performed, albeit with contradictory findings (Bona- fe et al., 2003; Kojima et al., 2004; Li et al., 2009). Bonafe et al. (2003) described a negative result in Italians that is – though only a single SNP was tested – consistent with ours. Recently, a study of Han Chinese found two SNPs as well as two haplotypes in this gene to be associated with longevity in women (Li et al., 2009). The results of the single-point analysis were also replicated in an additional sample of Chinese (Li et al., 2009). However, two previous investigations of Asian populations had revealed no association (Kojima et al., 2004; Willcox et al., 2008). One of the studies that examined only male individuals of Japanese des- cent (Willcox et al., 2008) is not informative with regard to a potential association in females. Another report analyzing Japa- nese of both genders tested three SNPs (Kojima et al., 2004), which were not haplotype-tagging and thus did not cover the allelic variation in FOXO1 comprehensively. Of note, one of the SNPs, rs2297627, is in strong LD with one of the significantly associated markers described in Han Chinese (rs2755209,

Polymorphisms in FOXO3A have convincingly and repeatedly been associated in numerous populations with the ability to sur- vive into old age (Willcox et al., 2008; Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2010). Although here we used a larger sample than the one genotyped for the FOXO3A analysis (Flachsbart et al., 2009), our results did not ascertain an association of FOXO1, FOXO4, or FOXO6 with longevity in Germans. The members of the FOXO gene family share some characteristics (more than 60% sequence identity of the human FOXO domain (Anderson et al., 1998), regulation via the IIS pathway and a seemingly functional redundancy in vitro (Coffer & Burgering, 2004)) and yet their physiological roles are thought to be diverse (Wang et al., 2009), a finding that is supported by different expression patterns (Furuyama et al., 2000; Biggs et al., 2001). This functional diversification is also illustrated by the disruption of the FOXO genes (Hosaka et al., 2004): while a homozygous knock-out of FOXO1 is embryonically lethal, FOXO3A)⁄) and FOXO4)⁄) animals are viable and initially develop normal.

Study participants

The study sample comprised 1447 LLI with an age range of 95–110 years (mean age: 98.8 years) and 1029 younger con- trols (60–75 years; mean age: 66.8 years). About 75% of the LLI were women. The controls were similar to the LLI in terms of gender (75% women), ancestry, and geographic origin. There are no mortality data available for the controls. However, based on current predictions, only 1.5% of all 60-year-old and 1.8% of all 75-year-old German women will become 100 years. The study participants provided, as part of a health and family history questionnaire, personal and medical information. A detailed description of the study population and recruitment procedures is provided elsewhere (Nebel et al., 2005). All subjects gave written, informed consent prior to enrolment. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel.

Table 5 Comparison of minor allele frequencies of FOXO1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in German, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese controls

The Italian women sample consisted of 166 LLI (90–109 years, mean age: 98.39 years) and 216 younger controls (18–48 years; mean age: 31.06 years) obtained from the Southern Italian Cen- tenarian Study (SICS). SICS LLI were thoroughly investigated for demographic and clinical characteristics and they were enrolled by Associazione Longevita` (Anselmi et al., 2009). All subjects gave written informed consent to the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the ‘Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico’, Multimedica, Milano, Italy.

Genotyping

Genotyping of the German samples was performed using the SNPlexTM Genotyping System and TaqMan(cid:2) SNP Genotyping Assays (both Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on an automated platform (Hampe et al., 2001). For quality control purposes, positive controls on each genotyping plate were checked for consistency. All SNPs were tested for deviation from the HWE. The call rate for each marker exceeded 95.8%.

††Based on SNP rs2297626 from Kojima et al. (2004) that is in strong with rs17630266 (r2 = 0.95, using JPT HapMap data).

Further studies are needed to clarify in more detail the in vivo roles of the FOXO genes, and in particular of FOXO3A, in human longevity.

Genotyping of SICS individuals was carried out with the Infini- um II Assay-HumanHap 317K duo BeadChip system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using standard protocols. Individual sam- ples and markers showing a genotyping rate lower than 93% and 95%, respectively, were excluded. Imputation of unob- served genotypes was performed using Impute, version 0.5 (Marchini et al., 2007) with the HapMap CEU release 24 refer- ence panel (http://www.hapmap.org/).

Statistical analysis

Haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) of FOXO1, FOXO4, and FOXO6 were selected based on the HapMap genotypes of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU; http://www.hapmap.org/) and the pairwise tagging option implemented in the Haploview v3.32 program (Barrett et al., 2005) (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/) (minor allele frequency: > 0.05, pairwise r2 ‡ 0.8, P : > 0.01, for htSNPs HWE see Table 1). The exact genomic regions for the selection of the htSNPs were as follows: for FOXO1 chromosome 13: 40 022 274–40 144 279; for FOXO4 X chromosome: 70 227 715–70 245 118 and for FOXO6 chromosome 1: 41 596 756–41 624 373 (all NCBI36). The Haploview program was also applied for the haplotype analysis of FOXO1. An additional haplotype analy- sis using a two-marker sliding window was performed for all three genes with the sliding window option implemented in the programme COCAPHASE, version 2.403 that is part of PHASE, version 2.1 (http://www.stat.washington.edu/stephens/; Dud- bridge, 2003). Single-point analysis was performed using PLINK v1.07 (Purcell et al., 2007). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The a priori power calculation for rs2755209 in the German and Italian women sample was carried out with the PS Power and Sample Size Program (PS version 3.0.14; http:// medipe.psu.ac.th/episoft/pssamplesize), assuming an OR of 0.77 as observed in the Chinese study (Li et al., 2009) and the minor allele frequency (40%) characteristic of the CEU HapMap sample.
