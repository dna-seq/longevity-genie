Association of longevity with IL-10 1082 GA and TNF-a 308 GA polymorphisms is linked to genetic factors (Karasik et al., 2005). People who survive beyond 85 years old, including centenarians, octogenarians, and nonagenarians, are characterized by a marked delay or escape from age-related diseases. Therefore, analyzing genes that modulate susceptibility to age-related diseases in these populations may provide insights into human longevity.

Summary
Cytokines are crucial for regulating inflammation development in humans. Many studies have shown that variations in cytokine genes might play a role in determining human longevity. This study examined changes in the gene pool relevant to the 308 GA polymorphism in the promoter region of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a gene and the 1082 GA polymorphism in the promoter region of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 gene with aging and survival selection occurring in the Jordanian population. IL-10 1028 GA and TNF-a 308 GA were genotyped in 119 randomly selected elderly subjects (41 women and 78 men) with a mean age of 90.2 years and young control subjects of 118 (46 women and 72 men) with a mean age of 31.9 years. No significant differences were found in the genotype and allele frequencies of TNF-a gene variants between the two groups (P > 0.05), while IL-10 genotype and allele frequencies were significantly associated with longevity in men (P < 0.05) but not in women (P < 0.05). Thus, IL-10 1028 GA polymorphism seems to play a role in the pathway to longevity in Jordanian men.

Processes that could intensify susceptibility to diseases have been studied (Krabbe et al., 2004; Griffin, 2006; et al., 2006; Sbarsi et al., 2007; Yamashina et al., 2007; Sansoni et al., 2008). As cytokines regulate inflammatory status in humans, allelic variations in inflammatory cytokine genes might affect human lifespan. In fact, certain variations in cytokine genes have been shown to be associated with human longevity type (Cavallone et al., 2003; Scola et al., 2003, Carrieri et al., 2004; Caruso et al., 2004; et al., 2004; Franceschi et al., 2005; Candore et al., 2006). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-10 are two cytokines with opposite functions in the inflammatory response. TNF-a acts predominantly as a proinflammatory agent, whereas IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine (Bidwell et al., 1999; Dinarello, 2000). Therefore, variations in levels of TNF-a and IL-10 might have an impact on the inflammatory response with a subsequent effect on longevity. Two polymorphisms in the promoter of TNF-a (GA transition at position 308) and (GA transition at position 1082) are related to transcriptional activity (Kroeger et al., 1997; et al., 1997; Crawley et al., 1999; Gibson et al., 2001; Cacev et al., 2008). Their functional is evident by their involvement in determining susceptibility to immune-inflammatory diseases (Hajeer Hutchinson, 2000; Howell & Rose-Zerilli, 2006). In addition, the IL-10 1082 GA and TNF-a 308 polymorphisms are associated with longevity in (Lio et al., 2002a, 2003; Cardelli et al., 2008).

Introduction
Longevity is a biological phenomenon that means successful aging resulting from a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors (Kirkwood, 2005). Environmental factors include dietary habits, physical activity, smoking, and healthcare, whereas genetic factors consist of the various loci playing key roles in body homeostasis (Dossey, 2002). Arguably, about one-quarter of the longevity trend can be attributed to genetic factors (Karasik et al., 2005).

Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to examine the association of TNF-a and IL-10 alleles with longevity in the Jordanian population. We found that the frequency of 308 A is low in the Jordanian population, whereas the frequency of IL-10 1082 A allele is very common. No association between 308 GA TNF-a promoter SNP in our sample of Jordanian elderly with longevity was detected, whereas 1082 GA IL-10 promoter SNP was associated with longevity in men but not in women.

Materials andThe text appears to be well-written and free of errors. As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to determine the accuracy of the scientific information presented in the text.Screening for the presence of modifier polymorphisms in addition to direct measurements of the plasma levels of IL-10 and TNF-a is warranted in future studies (Makhatadze, 1998; Cacev et al., 2008). In this study, we asked whether cytokine gene polymorphisms could account for one part of the genetic component of longevity in the Jordanian population. The data showed that no statistically significant differences were found between the elderly and controls when comparing genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the 1082 GA IL-10 promoter and the 308 GA TNF-a promoter SNPs. However, when gender is considered, the 1082 GA IL-10 genotype and allele frequencies were significantly associated with longevity in men but not in women. This result is consistent with previous observations by Lio et al. (2003) on the Italian population. Gender has been shown to be a major variable in the genetics of longevity in different populations. For example, Adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma-2, IL-6, and Tyrosine Hydroxylase genes have been associated with longevity in men but not in women (Bonafe et al., 2001; De Luca et al., 2001; Barbieri et al., 2004; Atzmon et al., 2008). On the other hand, haemochromatosis, interferon-gamma, and Apo C-I gene polymorphisms are associated with longevity in women but not in men (Galinsky et al., 1997; Lio et al., 2002a,c, 2003). This indicates that men and women might follow different pathways to longevity. The mechanisms that explain the gender effect on the pathway to longevity are still unknown; however, gender differences in hormonal signalling pathways, immunity response, detoxification mechanisms, and oxidative damage tolerance might account for it. 

Conclusion: This is the first report to investigate the association of genetic loci and longevity in an Arabic population. The results of this study indicate that the IL-10 1082 GA promoter polymorphism plays a role in men but not in women's longevity, whereas TNF-a 308 GA promoter polymorphism plays no significant role in both men and women's longevity in the Jordanian population.

Positive association of these polymorphism has been reported in the Italian and Bulgarian populations (Lio et al., 2002a,b; Naumova et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Cardelli et al., 2008) whereas negative association with these polymorphisms has been reported in Finnish populations. Atzmon et al. (2008) found that Adiponectin levels and genotype are a potential regulator of lifespan in humans. Carrieri et al. (2004) found that the GC polymorphism of transforming growth factor beta is associated with human longevity, while Candore et al. (2006) found that inflammation, longevity, and cardiovascular diseases are related to polymorphisms of TLRs.I'm sorry, but the text you provided is a list of references and not a coherent piece of text.
