BRCA1 Gene Sequence Variation in Centenarians

of Gerontological Research, Italian National Research Center on Aging (INRCA), Ancona, Italy

ABSTRACT: With the ample gene sequence information that has become avail- able with the human genome project virtually completed, it has become possi- ble to identify functional gene variants and their frequencies in elderly populations with different aging-related characteristics. Such a genetic epide- miological approach could lead to new insights with respect to the basic mech- anisms of aging and longevity as well as the identification of new targets to prevent or retard some of the late-age adverse effects. Using our recently devel- oped two-dimensional gene scanning (TDGS) technology platform we demon- strate the feasibility of this approach by screening two different populations of centenarians for polymorphic variation in the BRCA1 breast cancer suscepti- bility gene, one of the many genes involved in genome maintenance. The initial results obtained with this approach suggest differences in BRCA1 genotype fre- quencies between the centenarian populations and controls.

The success of the human genome project combined with new technologies of ge- netic analysis have greatly facilitated the identification of genes with inherited mu- tations that predispose to various age-related disorders, including specific cancers. Such genes are often involved in genome stability pathways, to maintain DNA integ- rity. Examples are the DNA mismatch repair genes, MLH1 and MSH2, heritable mu- tations in which predispose to colon cancer,1 and the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.2,3 It is assumed that increased genomic instability and mutation accumulation is causally related to the increased risk of cancer observed in individuals with heritable defects in these genes.

In a more general sense, genomic instability in organs and tissues has been con- sidered as a major cause of aging. In this respect, increased mutation accumulation could lead to tissue atrophy and neoplasms, as well as increased loss of cellular func- tion.4–6 This process could be driven by oxygen free radicals and other sources of spontaneous DNA damage, although unambiguous evidence for such a causal rela- tionship is still lacking.7,8 Oxidative stress is known to induce genome rearrange- ment mutations, such as large deletions, inversions or translocations.9,10 These types of mutation have been demonstrated to accumulate during aging in various tissues of normal mice.11 In this respect, it has been speculated that, in addition to causing cell death and cell transformation, a relatively small number of such large mutations could destabilize the genome, leading to dysregulation of normal patterns of gene expression.6

Ultimately, the quality of genome stability systems determines the rate and spec- trum of mutation accumulation during aging. In this respect, evidence is accumulat- ing that defects in those systems that control the frequency of large DNA rearrangement mutations are associated with symptoms of accelerated senescence, in both mice and humans. This is the case for mice with defects in double-strand break repair genes, which can be expected to greatly accelerate the rate of illegiti- mate recombinations. Recent evidence indicates that mice with inactivated genes in- volved in non-homologous end joining, i.e., Ku86, prematurely exhibit symptoms of age-related degeneration in various tissues, including liver, skin and bone.12 Disrup- tion of the mouse Ercc1 gene, which is involved in both nucleotide excision repair and a mitotic recombination pathway, also shows symptoms of accelerated senes- cence, including premature replicative senescence of Ercc1-mutant cells.13 Prema- ture replicative senescence, which could be an important marker for in vivo aging,14 has also been observed for murine cells deficient for other genes involved in recom- binational repair and non-homologous end joining, including Atm, Brca2, Ku70 and DNA ligase IV.12 Cellular proliferation defects have also been observed in murine Brca1 mutant cells and a mammary-specific conditional Brca1 knock-out mouse model revealed genetic instability and tumorigenesis in combination with growth in- hibition in vivo.15

The possible role of genomic instability in aging is further exemplified by recent work investigating telomere maintenance in the preservation of tissue functioning during aging. In a study of third generation telomerase-deficient mice, shortened life span was found to be accompanied by reduced capacity to respond to stresses such as wound healing, hematopoietic ablation and by an increased incidence of sponta- neous malignancies.16 The results of these studies underscore that in proliferative or- gans the early initiation of genetic instability due to telomere erosion can greatly accelerate age-related loss of cell viability and increase tumor formation.

An important body of evidence that large genomic mutations are causally related to the degenerative aspects of the aging process has been derived from human syn- dromes of accelerated aging, such as Werner syndrome. Werner syndrome, which is caused by a heritable mutation in a human homologue of the bacterial RecQ gene, termed WRN in humans,17 is characterized by the accelerated occurrence of certain aspects of the senescent phenotype, including cancer.18 The WRN gene encodes both a helicase and an exonuclease19 and is thought to play a role in suppressing genomic instability.20 Indeed, cultured somatic cells from patients with Werner syndrome dis-

play an increased rate of somatic mutations and a variety of cytogenetic abnormali- ties, such as deletions and translocations.21 This high level of genomic instability could be the cause of the severe limitation of in vitro life span demonstrated in Wern- er cells.18 Also other so-called progeroid syndromes, such as ataxia telangiectasia and Bloom syndrome show increased genomic instability.18

TABLE 1 summarizes the pathways and some of the genes thus far identified that are involved in the suppression of large genomic mutations. As discussed above, de- fects in many of these genes have been found associated with accelerated senes- cence, but not always and not to the same extent. This is expected, since even if aging would be totally based on genomic instability it would be highly unlikely that com- plete inactivation of any gene in any of these pathways would closely mimic the nor- mal aging process. Instead, one would expect combinations of subtle allelic variants of these genes to determine the aging phenotype. It is possible to test this by creating mouse models with a variety of knock-in variants of the relevant genome stability genes. However, an alternative and reasonable approach would be to compare fre- quencies of the various alleles of loci involved in genome maintenance and repair and more specifically the pathways listed in TABLE 1 in different human populations with characteristic aging-related phenotypes. Such phenotypes could include ex- tremely short or extremely long life, extreme susceptibility or extreme resistance to organ-specific age-related loss of function and extreme susceptibility or extreme re- sistance to age-related disease. One would expect that at least some of those allelic variants that give rise to amino acid changes, has functional consequences in terms of the level of proficiency at which genome maintenance operates. At present, it is

not possible to accurately predict functionality directly from variations in the gene coding sequences. However, statistically significant variations among populations with well-defined aging-related characteristics could provide a good starting point for subsequent functional studies. This approach is schematically depicted in FIGURE 1.

Thus far, association studies have been based on single polymorphisms in candi- date genes. The best known example in this respect is the observed lower frequency of the APOE4 variant in centenarians,22 a higher frequency of which had previously been found associated with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease.23 However, any positive result could be due to an effect of the polymorphism on the function of the candidate gene or it could be due to some other gene variant that is in linkage disequilibrium with the marker locus. It has recently been shown that the distances over which link- age disequilibrium acts are small, i.e., typically less than 3 kb,24 although these data have recently been challenged.25 Nevertheless, unless all polymorphic variation in a large number of candidate genes is detected, this type of studies is unlikely to yield significant results in most cases.

With the rapid emergence of complete sequence information for all human genes it is theoretically possible to scrutinize all genes or families of genes suspected to be involved in a complex phenotype for all possible polymorphic variation in a group of subjects as compared to a control group. Individual differences in complex phe- notypes, of which familial aggregation or twin studies suggest a genetic component, could be due to common variants of genes controlling one or more functional path- ways thought to play a role in the phenotype. In a recent study, Cargill et al.26 sys- tematically surveyed the coding regions of 106 genes relevant to cardiovascular disease, endocrinology and neuropsychiatry for all possible variants in a sample of mixed ethnic groups. For this purpose, they used a combination of oligonucleotide chip array hybridization and DHPLC (HPLC of DNA fragments in a temperature gradient). In these 106 genes a total of 560 single nucleotide polymorphisms were discovered.

direct functional relevance to a complex phenotype. There are two potential tions to this approach. The first involves the relatively small number of genes have been completely identified in terms of structure and function. Although ally all human genes are now available as ESTs, only a limited number has been fined by a complete cDNA sequence and functional pathway. Indeed, for only ′ few genes a complete genomic sequence including 3 UTR, promoter and flanking regions is readily available. With the genome program drawing to a the next few years it is reasonable to expect that most of these gaps will be filled ly soon and that complete sequence information and pathway assignments will

A second potential limitation to screen directly for functional polymorphic vari- ants involved in a complex trait involves the technology to screen multiple genes in large numbers of individuals for all possible sequence variation, which is still in its infancy. Most technology in this respect is limited by the need to PCR amplify each individual target sequence for mutational scanning. Moreover, the most advanced methods, such as the DNA chip method used in the two studies described above, in- volve relatively expensive technology that has not been completely validated (a sig- nificant number of variants are missed). A cost-effective method developed in our laboratory is based on extensive multiplex PCR to obtain the target fragments, which are subsequently analyzed on two-dimensional denaturing gradient gels for all pos- sible sequence variants.28,29

TWO-DIMENSIONAL GENE SCANNING

The most reliable way of detecting DNA sequence alterations in genes is nucle- otide sequencing, the gold standard in mutation detection. Sequencing is PCR-based with preparation of template on an exon-by-exon basis. This is expensive and labor- intensive, even in the semi-automated setting. Other mutation scanning techniques, e.g., single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, trade off accuracy for rela- tive throughput. Many novel methods with the potential of both a high throughput and a high accuracy remain immature and unproven in practice. Moreover, virtually all methods rely on PCR amplification to obtain the target sequences.30

gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE allows for the separation of DNA differing by as little as one base pair, on the basis of differences in temperature.31 A given DNA fragment comprises one or more representing a stretch of between about 50 and 500 base pairs with equal % temperature (the temperature at which each base pair has a 50 probability in either the helical or the denatured state). Therefore, when a fragment migrates, parallel to the gradient of denaturants (urea/formamide the lowest melting domain will denature first and, because of of the DNA strands, the fragment will be retarded in the gel. The melting of a domain is dependent on the base composition of the fragment

base pairs have a higher melting temperature than A-T base pairs) and the stacking interactions of the bases. Therefore, DNA sequence variations will be reflected by the positions in the gel where the fragments are halted.

introducing so-called GC-clamps, i.e., a stretch of 30 to 50 G and C bases, to the tar- get DNA fragments.32 A convenient way of attaching a GC-clamp to the target frag- ment is by making it part of one of the primers.33 Without GC-clamping, a DNA fragment consisting of one melting domain will become completely single stranded upon denaturation and runs off the gel. By adding a GC-clamp, a single high melting domain is artificially created at one end of the target fragment. This will prevent complete melting and ensures that the fragment halts at the melting temperature of the target sequence. However, when the target DNA fragment consists of multiple melting domains, only mutations in the lowest melting domain are readily detected. To facilitate detection of all possible mutations, it is imperative that the target frag- ment represents only one melting domain. Fortunately, since the addition of a GC- clamp allows for stacking interactions with neighboring bases, the entire target frag- ment will often behave as one melting domain. However, this is not always the case, and in practice, the target fragment needs to be “designed”, e.g., through the strategic positioning of PCR primers to achieve the ideal single melting domain.

duction of a heteroduplexing step using one round of denaturation/renaturation, usu- ally at the end of PCR amplification of the target fragment. In this manner, a heterozygous mutation is revealed as four different double-stranded fragments: two homoduplex molecules (one homoduplex wild type and one homoduplex mutant) and two heteroduplex molecules (each comprising one wild type and one mutant strand). The less stable mismatched heteroduplex molecules will melt earlier than the two homoduplex molecules.

% Although DGGE has the crucial advantage of having close to 100 sensitivity in detecting mutations,34,35 it has typically been applied in a serial fashion, e.g., on an exon by exon basis, for analyzing large genes. With the introduction of two-dimen- sional gene scanning (TDGS) we have transformed the method from the existing se- rial to a parallel system. The first step in TDGS is a large-scale multiplex PCR. Initial pre-amplification of multiple exons by long-distance PCR has been demon- strated to provide suitable template for a highly specific multiplex PCR. Indeed, the over-representation of the exon-containing genomic fragments, relative to the ge- nomic environment, permits multiplex groups of as many as 24 fragments.36

A successful implementation of extensive multiplex PCR amplification in DGGE-based gene mutational scanning tests requires a high-resolution separation system. An example of such a system is the original two-dimensional DGGE format31 in which fragments are first separated according to size and, subsequently, further sorted as a function of their melting temperature. Although high resolution may also be obtained by using one-dimensional denaturing gradient gels, the 2-D system allows characterization of each fragment on the basis of its xy-coordinates (size and melting temperature). In practice, by using the 2-D system, it is possible to completely visualize all fragments corresponding to an entire gene or multiple genes for a particular DNA sample and immediately recognize each exon and variants therein (schematically depicted for the BRCA1 gene in FIG. 2). Different sequence

variants in the same exon can be distinguished on the basis of their unique 4-spot pat- terns.29 A potential hindrance to the widespread application of this system to multi- ple, novel genes involves the difficulties in the design of PCR primers generating single-domain fragments which can be resolved under one set of electrophoretic conditions. In order to minimize the time needed to optimize TDGS tests with re- spect to PCR conditions, melting behavior and distribution of fragments in the 2-D gel, a computerized test design has been developed.37

An automated system for 2-D DNA electrophoresis has been This sys- tem has a modest throughput of only 4 2-D gels per day. However, with one technician who can easily operate up to three of these systems a total of 140,000 bp of genomic DNA can be comprehensively analyzed per day for all possible sequence variants. The system is presently modified to increase the throughput per instrument to about 500,000 bp per day.

To test the general applicability and usefulness of TDGS in generating complete spectra of sequence variation in large genes or in multiple genes, we screened cen- tenarian and control populations, on a pilot scale, for functional variants of BRCA1.

COMMON BRCA1 GENE VARIANTS AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO BREAST CANCER IN CENTENARIANS

BRCA1 is the first human familial breast cancer susceptibility gene As mentioned above and summarized in TABLE 1, BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene likely to be involved in DNA recombinational repair.39 A large number of distinct heritable mutations in BRCA1 have been described, most of which result in a trun- cated BRCA1 protein.40 Heritable mutations in BRCA1 confer an over 90% life time risk of breast cancer. In view of the large size of the gene (24 exons, comprising 5592 bp of coding DNA) large-scale gene sequence comparisons in population-based studies have not been performed. However, the data available suggest that the fre- quency of highly penetrant BRCA1 mutations in the normal population is between 1 in 500 and 1 in 2000 individuals.41 The lack of cost-efficient re-sequencing technol- ogy has also constrained population studies on common polymorphisms in BRCA1, which could confer more modest individual risk. In principle, such common variants could explain a far larger part of breast cancer cases.

As mentioned above, one of the benefits of parallel screening by TDGS is that each pattern reveals all homo- and heterozygous variants in the entire gene. The ef- fect of association studies on functional gene variants will now be much more valu- able than the study of single polymorphisms in candidate genes, as has been done so far. So far, a total of 7 polymorphic sites in 6 TDGS fragments in BRCA1 have been identified that give rise to an amino acid change. Owing to strong linkage disequi- librium, these 7 polymorphic sites generate only 6 different haplotypes, i.e., alleles (A–F; TABLE 2). The frequencies of these alleles were compared between groups of centenarians and controls. Centenarians were selected for this study because breast cancer is extremely rare in such individuals of highly advanced age. Hence, it is pos- sible that optimal sequence variants of this gene contribute to this extreme resistan- cy, possibly as a consequence of its increased proficiency in the process of recombinational repair. Two different centenarian populations were studied, i.e., one population consisted of 102 centenarians from the New England area42 and one pop- ulation consisted of 84 centenarians from Italy.43 The control population consisted of 97 individuals from Italy. All three populations were mainly white.

Results so far obtained indicate that there are no significant differences in BRCA1 allele (haplotype) frequencies among the three populations (FIG. 3). This also ap- plied to the APOE4 variant that was included as a positive control. However, in keep- ing with earlier studies the frequency of the APOE4 variant was lower in the centenarians as compared to controls (FIG. 3). Comparison to previously published results obtained from 795 breast- and/or ovarian cancer probands sampled from the US and Europe40 confirmed that at the allele frequency level only minor differences are observed.

Although allele frequencies might give an early indication of possible of the population-specific effect of the different haplotypes and disease, actual ciation should be carried out using the frequencies of allele combinations (i.e., + otype frequencies). As shown in FIGURE 4, the BRCA1 genotype a a showed to more frequent in both centenarian groups compared to the control = + (p 0.1473), whereas genotype “a b” was less frequent (p = 0.0526). In this + the A4 A4 APOE genotype was not found for any of the 99 New England ians and scored 2 times for the 27 control individuals in which this was (FIG. 4).

The high number of genotypes and the low frequency of some of the alleles re- quire the analysis of large numbers of samples. Only when the sample repository is sufficiently high, reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the frequencies of all genotypes including some of the rare ones. In this respect, especially haplotype “f” is of interest because of the presence of Arg356 instead of Gln356. There is evidence

that Arg356 homozygosity is less frequent in breast cancer patients than in controls44 indicating that it may be protective against breast cancer. Although in our present study the frequency of allele f with the Arg356 present was found to be slightly higher in centenarians, the number of individuals analyzed is still too low to draw any definite conclusions.

SUMMARY

One way to test possible causal relationships between various functional path- ways and the aging process is to comparatively analyze polymorphic variation in genes participating in these pathways in elderly populations with different aging- related characteristics. The results of the Human Genome Project now make it fea- sible to identify most if not all genes involved in the candidate pathways that drive the aging process or confer longevity. For this purpose, efficient genotyping methods are needed that allow the comprehensive sequence analysis of multiple genes at the population level. Using our recently developed two-dimensional gene scanning (TDGS) technology platform we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by screening two different populations of centenarians for polymorphic variation in the BRCA1 breast cancer susceptibility gene. The results indicate that using this tech- nology relatively large numbers of individuals, i.e., hundreds, can be screened in a relatively short time for all possible sequence variants of this very large gene. Al- though the number of individuals analyzed is still insufficient to draw definite con- clusions, a clear trend towards a difference in genotype frequency involving two of the most common alleles became apparent. Based on these results we conclude that rather than studying individual polymorphisms in groups of elderly with different

aging-related characteristics, it should be feasible to analyze multiple genes partici- pating in functional pathways that are possibly involved in aging and longevity for differences in the frequency of potentially functional alleles.
