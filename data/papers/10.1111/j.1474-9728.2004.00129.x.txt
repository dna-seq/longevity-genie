younger individuals (P = 0.007). Finally, active TGF-ββββ 1 plasma levels were significantly increased in the elderly group, but no relationship with TGF-ββββ 1 genotypes was observed. These results suggest that, at least in this popu- lation, the variability of the TGF-ββββ 1 gene influences lon- gevity and that the age-related increase in plasma levels of active TGF-ββββ 1 seems not to be genetically regulated. Key words: aging; centenarians; inflammation; longevity; polymorphism; TGF-ββββ 1.

Introduction

A growing amount of data suggest that aging is associated with an up-regulation of the inflammatory response, probably due to the chronic antigenic stress which impinges lifelong upon innate immunity and leads to a pro-inflammatory status that we proposed to call inflamm-aging (Franceschi et al., 2000a). Indeed, a series of studies demonstrated that inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of several age-related disorders (e.g. atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and osteoporosis) and in the increase of the mortality risk (Franceschi et al., 2000a; Bruunsgaard et al., 2001; Lio et al., 2003). Cytokines play an important role in inflamm-aging and many of them may be involved in the pathogenesis of those age-related disorders having an important inflammatory component. Interestingly, a number of studies suggest that common sequence variations of the cytokine genes may have an effect on the amount of the cytokine secreted (Bidwell et al., 1999, 2001) and may con- sequently affect the interindividual differences in the inflam- matory response, thus modulating susceptibility and severity of several pathologies (Keen et al., 1998; Francis et al., 1999; Licastro et al., 2000). Moreover, sequence variations in several cytokines, such as interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and interferon-γ have been shown to be associated with successful aging and longevity (Bonafè et al., 2001; Lio et al., 2002a,b).

Summary

Sequence variations in a variety of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine genes have been found to influence successful aging and longevity. Because of the role played by the transforming growth factor ββββ 1 (TGF-ββββ 1) cytokine in inflammation and regulation of immune responses, the variability of the TGF-ββββ 1 gene may affect longevity by playing a role in inflamm-aging. Two polymorphisms, G/ A and C/T , located in the 5′′′′ region, and two mis- −−−−800 −−−−509 sense polymorphisms, T/C and G/C which change 869 915 (Leu > Pro) and (Arg > Pro) , respectively, located in the 10 25 signal peptide, were analysed in 419 subjects from North- ern and Central Italy, including 172 centenarians and 247 younger controls. In addition, the effects of the TGF-ββββ 1 genetic variability on plasma levels of the biologically active form (naturally processed) of this cytokine were studied in 143 randomly selected subjects, including 73 centenarians. Significant differences were found at the +915 site as far as the C allele and GC genotype were con- cerned, both of them being lower in centenarians than in young controls (P = 0.034 and 0.028, respectively), but none of the other tested genetic variants was signifi- cantly different between centenarians and controls. Moreover, a particular haplotype combination (G /C −−−−800 −−−− /C /C ) was notably lower in centenarians than in 509 869 915

In line with these findings, it is conceivable that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) could play a role in longevity. TGF- β1, the prototypic member of the TGF-β superfamily, is secreted in a latent form and activated by proteolysis during processes such as immune modulation, differentiation and cell growth (Saharinen et al., 1999). This cytokine has been shown to have an essential role in inflammation and in maintenance of immune response homeostasis (Letterio & Roberts, 1998; Cottrez & Groux, 2001; Gorelik & Flavell, 2002). TGF-β1 belongs to the group of cytokines with anti-inflammatory effects, being a deac- tivating factor of macrophages having potent anti-inflammatory properties (Vodovotz et al., 1993; Smith et al., 1996; Weiss

et al., 1999). TGF-β1-deficient mice showed a severe and multifocal inflammatory response with the production of mul- tiple effector cytokines (Shull et al., 1992; McCartney-Francis & Wahl, 2002). Moreover, recent studies in mice have indicated that TGF-β1 is probably necessary to develop overt organ- specific age-related diseases with an inflammatory pathogenesis (Wyss-Coray et al., 2000; Mallat et al., 2001).

The potential role of in aging and longevity has been suggested by many in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, a TGF-β1 gene over-expression has been observed in human fibroblasts that displays a senescent-like phenotype following exposure to oxidative stress (Frippiat et al., 2001, 2002). Recently, polymorphisms identified in human TGF-β1 gene and influencing the cytokine production have been linked to age- related pathologies, such as hypertension (Li et al., 1999), oste- oporosis (Yamada, 2000) and Alzheimer’s disease (Luedecking et al., 2000).

To test the hypothesis that variability of the TGF-β1 gene affects successful aging and longevity, four TGF-β1 polymor- phisms have been compared between centenarians and younger subjects (20–60 years of age) recruited in Northern and Central Italy. Two polymorphisms, G/A and C/T , are located −800 −509 upstream of the expressed gene; two polymorphisms, T/C 869 and G/C , are located in the signal peptide and are missense 915 polymorphisms which change (Leu > Pro) and (Arg > Pro) , 10 25 respectively (Cambien et al., 1996; Awad et al., 1998).

χ2 = 0.104, d.f. = 1, P = 0.775 for allele frequencies. χ2 = 0.748, d.f. = 2, P = 0.699 for genotype frequencies.

All these variants may have a functional role. In fact, recent reports have provided evidence that the T allele is associated −509 with higher transcriptional activity of TGF-β1 compared with C (Luedecking et al., 2000; Schulte et al., 2001). Likewise, −509 because the G/A polymorphism occurs in a consensus CREB −800 half-site, an allele-specific affinity for the CREB family of transcrip- tion factors is hypothesized (Grainger et al., 1999; Luedecking et al., 2000). On the other hand, the two alleles encoding pro- line (C and C ) have been found to be associated with lower 869 915 cytokine synthesis both in vitro and in vivo (Awad et al., 1998;

Active TGF-β1 plasma levels were assessed in a group of 143 unrelated randomly selected subjects, including 73 centenarians (24 males and 49 females) ranging from 99 to 103 years of age and 70 young controls (22 males and 48 females) ranging from 20 to 60 years of age. Significantly increased bio-active TGF-β1 plasma levels were observed in centenarian subjects both in men and in women (Fig. 1A,B). The mean plasma levels of active TGF-β1 in male centenarians were 144.61 ± 74.8 pg mL−1 and in male controls were 92.10 ± 37.88 pg mL−1. The mean plasma levels of active TGF-β1 in female centenarians were 144.44 ± 60.25 pg mL−1 and in female controls were 113.77 ± 48.08 pg mL−1. Alleles and genotypes of four polymorphic sites at the TGF-β1 gene were estimated in the group of people described above. TGF-β1 plasma levels did not show any association with genotypes of the four polymorphisms (data not shown).

genotypes were in agreement (P > 0.05) with those expected at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in every sample at each locus. No significant differences were found between young and cen- tenarian groups either for genotypes or for alleles at polymor- phic sites G/A , C/T and T/C (P > 0.05). In contrast, for −800 −509 869 the polymorphism G/C the statistical difference between 915 centenarians and younger controls for genotype and allele frequency distributions was significant (Table 2, χ2 = 6.097, d.f. = 2, P = 0.034 for genotype frequencies; χ2 = 4.848, d.f. = 1, P = 0.028 for allele frequencies). By linkage-disequilibrium analysis, nine haplotype combinations (Table 3) were observed in each group and no significant difference in the overall haplo- type frequency distributions was found between young and centenarian groups (χ2 = 12.939, d.f. = 8, P = 0.08), even when sexes were analysed separately (data not shown). A significantly decreased frequency of a particular haplotype combination (G C C C ), among the less frequent, was −800 −509 869 915 observed in centenarians compared with the control group (χ2 = 7.366, d.f. = 1, P = 0.007). The P value was not significant after Bonferroni correction (P = 0.056); however, this correc- adj tion is too stringent and has the potential to ignore important observations (Perneger, 1998). In fact, there was a survival advantage for subjects who did not have the G C C C −800 −509 869 915 haplotype combination [OR 2.25 (95% CI 1.24–4.10) P = 0.005]

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to test whether the variability of the TGF-β1 gene, a pleiotropic regulator of cellular activity and the immune system (Letterio & Roberts, 1998; Blobe et al., 2000), is involved in human longevity. In this paper, we focused on four common polymorphisms of the TGF-β1 gene: two polymorphisms, G/A and C/T , located in the promoter −800 −509 region, and two missense polymorphisms, T/C and G/C , 869 915 which change (Leu > Pro) and (Arg > Pro) , respectively, 10 25 located in the signal peptide. The genotype and allele frequen- cies found in the present study for the tested polymorphisms were not different from those of other Caucasians, thus con- firming and extending, over a large group of Italians, the data on TGF-β1 genotypes and alleles in Europeans (Cambien et al., 1996; Holla et al., 2002).

Within this population genetics perspective the novel finding of this paper is that a significant difference was found between centenarians and younger control subjects for the genotype and allele frequency distributions at the TGF-β1 +915 site in the signal

which is probably a common driving force of most age-associated pathologies. These data are in agreement with those reported by Forsey et al. (2003) in octogenarian and nonagenarian subjects showing a significant increase of active TGF-β1, but contrast with other data referring to much younger subjects (Young et al., 1999). These findings on TGF-β1 are also in agree- ment with previous results showing an increase in plasma levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in centenarians (Cavallone et al., 2003). In conclusion, the data presented here provide new evidence for a relevant biological role of TGF-β1, adding human longevity to the long list of phenomena affected by this cytokine.

peptide. In most of our previous studies the association between cytokine gene polymorphisms and longevity was gender- associated, leading us to deduce that men and women follow different strategies to reach the extreme limits of human life- span (Bonafè et al., 2001; Lio et al., 2002a,c). This is not the case in the present paper: we found no gender-specific difference with regard to the genotype and allele frequency distributions at the TGF-β1 analysed loci .

By contrast, a loss of allele C of the GC heterozygous 915 and 915 genotype was observed in centenarians with respect to the young control group; consequently, an increase of allele G 915 and the GG homozygous genotype was evident. In the same 915 groups no significant differences in allele or genotype frequen- cies were observed for the polymorphisms G/A , C/T and −800 −509 T/C Moreover, a significant decreased frequency of the hap- 869. lotype combination G C C C was observed in cente- −800 −509 869 915 narians in comparison with the young control group, suggesting that G/C polymorphism is associated with long life expect- 915 ancy. As this polymorphism occurs at codon 25 within the signal peptide that is cleaved from the TGF-β1 precursor at the level of codon 29, it is possible that the (Arg > Pro) substitution 25 could play a role in the efficient production of the mature TGF- β1. Moreover, because the signal peptide allows export of the cytokine precursor across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, it could be hypothesized that the polymorphism at codon 25 affects this process. Finally, Hoffmann et al. (2001) have observed that codon 25 regulates gene transcription, which therefore might be affected by nucleotide change at the +915 site. All these functional characteristics of G/C poly- 915 morphism could play a role in explaining the difference in allele and genotype frequencies between centenarians and younger controls. Previous studies showed that the G allele at codon 25 was associated with fibrotic diseases (Awad et al., 1998) and higher blood pressure (Li et al., 1999), and thus the increase of the G allele found in our centenarian sample is an apparent par- adox. However, unexpected and counter-intuitive results have often been found in association studies on longevity candidate loci (Mari et al., 1996; Rose et al., 2001; Bonafè et al., 2002; Coppola et al., 2003; Garasto et al., 2003; Rea et al., 2004). We are pursuing the hypothesis that polymorphic variants in certain genes could be related to longevity or diseases as a consequence of peculiar interactions with other individual-specific variants in the nuclear as well as in the mitochondrial DNA (Rose et al., 2001; Garasto et al., 2003; Franceschi et al., in press).

Experimental procedures

Subjects

Two sample groups recruited in Central and Northern Italy were studied. The young group comprised 247 subjects (94 males and 153 females), ranging from 20 to 60 years of age. The sample of centenarians comprised 172 subjects (50 males and 122 females), 99–103 years of age. Each group was free of clinically manifest pathologies; in particular, centenarians belonged to classes A and B, according to the centenarians’ health status classification; category A included centenarians in good health status, defined as absence of physical disabilities, absence of severe cognitive impairment, absence of severe diseases such as cancer, ictus, liver diseases, etc., category C included cente- narians in poor health status and category B included centenar- ians in an intermediate health status (Franceschi et al., 2000b). Most of the subjects included in the present study had already been analysed in previous investigations to test the possible role of other genetic markers in human longevity (Bonafè et al., 1999, 2001; Lio et al., 2002a,b; Cavallone et al., 2003). All sub- jects had been informed about the aim of the study and had given their consent, in accordance with Italian laws.

Genotyping

DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes by phenol/chloro- form following standard procedures. Genotyping of all subjects participating in the study was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR product digestion with specific restriction enzymes. Primers were designed to amplify regions containing the analysed polymorphisms (G/A and C/T : 5′- −800 −509 ACCGTGCACCTGGAGATCG-3′, 5′-CCAGGCGGAGAAGGCT- TAAT-3′; T/C and G/C : 5′-CGCTTCACCAGCTCCATGTC- 869 915 GATAG-3′, 5′-CACACCAGCCCTGTTCGCGCTCT-3′). The amplification reaction for the polymorphisms in the promoter region was performed on a ‘PCR express Hybaid’ thermal cycler with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles, each one comprising denaturation at 94 °C for 45 min, annealing at 60 °C for 25 min and extension at 72 °C for 50 min, with a final extension time of 5 min at 72 °C. The ampli- fied PCR fragments for markers −800 and −509 were digested

Recent reports have also shown that the G allele at the +915 site in the TGF-β1 gene is associated with increased production of this anti-inflammatory cytokine both in vitro and in vivo (Awad et al., 1998; El-Gamel et al., 1998; Arkwright et al., 2000). In the present paper we have shown increased plasma levels of bio-active (naturally processed) TGF-β1 in the cente- narians both in women and in men, without any association with genotypes of the four TGF-β1 polymorphisms analysed. Moreover, because TGF-β1 is immunosuppressive, the age-related increase of the active cytokine suggests that it could counteract and counterbalance the harmful effects of inflamm-aging,

fibrotic lung disease, and graft fibrosis after lung transplantation. Transplantation

with restriction endonuclease enzymes Tsp45I and Bsu36I (New England Biolabs), respectively, and the samples were electro- phoresed in 2% agarose gels.

The amplification reaction for the polymorphisms in the signal peptide region was performed on a Biometra thermal cycler with initial denaturation at 96.5 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles, each one comprising denaturation at 96.5 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension time of 1 min at 72 °C. The amplified PCR fragments for markers +869 and +915 were digested with restriction endonuclease enzymes MspA1 I and BgII (New England Biolabs), respectively, and the samples were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gels 30% (19 : 1 acrylamide–polyacrylamide).

Immunoassay for bio-active TGF-ββββ 1

Plasma samples were available from 70 young controls (22 males and 48 females) and from 73 centenarians (24 males and 49 females). They were prepared from 15 mL of fresh EDTA- treated venous blood centrifuged at 960 g for 20 min at 4 °C and stored at −70 °C until the assay. Bio-active TGF-β1 plasma levels were quantified with a TGF-β1 Immunoassay (Promega System, Italy). To measure the amount of naturally processed TGF-β1 in plasma samples, we proceeded directly to the ELISA protocol without acid treatment, according to the manufac- turer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis

Allele and genotype frequency distributions were compared between young and centenarian groups by the Monte-Carlo χ2 test. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was checked by Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis (Guo & Thompson, 1992). Haplo- type frequencies were estimated by using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented with the Arlequin package (Schneider et al., 2000). A general linear model (imple- mented in the SPSS Package) was used to assess the age effects on plasma levels.
