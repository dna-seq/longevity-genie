the age of 95.1 Although dementia is common, it is not inevitable in the oldest old (e.g., 51% of a population-based cohort of Danish centenarians suffered from mild to severe dementia).2 In this cohort, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a were higher than in younger age groups (80- year-olds, a middle-aged group, and young controls), and a high concentration was associated with dementia and pe- ripheral atherosclerosis in centenarians.3 Moreover, TNF-a was a strong predictor of the mortality risk in the following 6 years, independent of dementia and cardiovascular dis- ease, suggesting that TNF-a had specific biological effects and was a marker of frailty in centenarians.4 However, it is still unclear whether high plasma levels of TNF-a was a causative factor or acted as a marker of underlying path- ological processes in dementia and cardiovascular diseases.

RESULTS: The distribution of TNF  308 genotypes was not different across the three different age groups, but the GA genotype was associated with decreased prevalence of dementia in centenarians. The few centenarians with AA carrier status had higher mortality risk and tended to show higher plasma levels of TNF-a, but the significance was questionable due to a low number of subjects with this genotype.

constitute the major categories of age-related dementia, but in centenarians it is difficult to distinguish between the two.2 It has been suggested that neuropathological lesions of AD and cerebrovascular lesions are necessary for the development of reduced cognitive function and dementia in very old people.5 Inflammation is an integral part of the pathology of AD and VaD, and several studies have de- scribed that increased TNF-a levels in the cerebrospinal fluid6,7 and in the circulation accompany both.8,9 It is un- clear whether local inflammatory mechanisms cause dam- age in the central nervous system (CNS) or if they are present to remove the detritus from other, more primary pathological processes. It is also unclear whether endo-

genous TNF-a is neurotoxic (based largely on acute inter- ventions) or neuroprotective (based largely on studies on genetically modified animals) during inflammatory proc- esses in the CNS10 (e.g., functional outcomes in TNF-a knockout mice were improved earlier after brain injury than in wild-type mice, but TNF-a knockout mice showed permanent deficits and reduced recovery).11

Dementia

The diagnosis of dementia was made according to the World Health Organization criteria from the International Classification of Diseases, as previously described.2 Details are given in Appendix 1. Briefly, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for screening of cognitive function. Actual living conditions and the need for assist- ance from other people were recorded using combined in- formation from the centenarian and caregivers/proxies. Activities of daily living (ADLs) were measured using the Katz Index and Lawton instrumental ADL (IADL) scale. Caregivers’/proxies’ information was recorded about abil- ity to make decisions, judgment, orientation, short-term memory, and long-term memory. The severity of dementia was rated according to the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. In the present study, only two categories were used: non- demented and demented. The use of the MMSE is a prob- lematic test in the present cohort of centenarians, but for most of the participants with missing MMSE data, other variables could provide the necessary information to assess cognitive function.2 Furthermore, information about ADLs and IADLs and proxy information regarding intellectual abilities made it possible to distinguish disability due to cognitive decline versus physical impairment.

If systemic inflammation is a cause and a consequence of age-related pathology such as dementia, the plasma level of TNF-a will be a marker of the magnitude of the inflam- matory response and the severity of pathology. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms that determine the rate of TNF-a production will be important risk factors. Nine polymorph- isms and five microsatellites in the TNF locus have been characterized.12 The TNF  308 G4A promoter poly- morphism is common, and it has been demonstrated that

Moreover, genetic polymorphisms that determine the rate of TNF-a production will be important risk factors. Nine polymorph- isms and five microsatellites in the TNF locus have been characterized.12 The TNF  308 G4A promoter poly- morphism is common, and it has been demonstrated that  308 A is a much stronger transcriptional activator than the more common G allele, but the effect is dependent on the cell line and the stimulus.13 The  308 A allele has been associated with increased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF-a production in whole blood.14 Furthermore, the  308 A allele has been associated with decreased preva- lence of leprosy, in which high circulating levels of TNF-a plays a protective role,15 and increased risk of cerebral ma-

 308 A allele has been associated with decreased preva- lence of leprosy, in which high circulating levels of TNF-a plays a protective role,15 and increased risk of cerebral ma- laria and autoimmune diseases, in which TNF-a has a det- rimental effect.16 The  308 A allele has also been associated with early onset of AD.17

Thus, a high plasma level of TNF-a may be a marker of dementia and an independent predictor of early mortality risk in centenarians. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the TNF  308 A allele is as- sociated with high prevalence of dementia, increased risk of all-cause mortality risk, and elevated circulating levels of TNF-a or inflammatory markers downstream in the in- flammatory cascade (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and C-reac- tive protein (CRP)) in a previously examined cohort of Danish centenarians. Furthermore, whether the TNF  308 A allele was inversely associated with longevity, evaluated by a lower prevalence in centenarians than in octogenarians and young controls, was investigated.

Deoxyribonucleic Acid Extracting and Genotyping

QIAamp mini Spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used for deoxyribonucleic acid extraction from whole blood that had been stored at  801C. The G to A transition at position  308 was analyzed using a Light Cycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using 3 mM magnesium chlo- ride, 1 mM of TNFUPST: 50-CCT CAA CGG ACT CAG CTT TC-30, 1 mM of TNFDOWST: 50-TCT CGG TTT CTT CTC CAT CG-30, 0.2 mM of TNFUP: 50-TAG GTT TTG AGG GGC ATG GGG AC-30-fluorescein, and 0.2 mM TNFDW: 50-LC Red640-GGG TTC AGC CTC CAG GGT CCT ACA CAC-30-phosphate. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using FastStart DNA Master Mix (Roche), and conditions included 951C for 600 seconds, 45 cycles of 951C for 5 seconds, 661C for 10 seconds and 721C for 20 seconds, followed by a melting curve analysis. The melting temperatures were 851C for the G allele and 651C for the A allele.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Centenarians

One hundred twenty-two centenarians from the Danish Centenarian Study, including 28 men, participated in the present study. This cohort has previously been de- scribed.2,3,18 Briefly, The Danish Centenarian Study is a nationwide epidemiological survey of all individuals living in Denmark who celebrated their 100th birthday from April 1, 1995, to May 31, 1996 (N 5 276). All participants were identified in the Civil Registration System in Denmark and admitted to the study as they turned 100. The participation rate was 75% (n 5 207). There was no difference between participants and nonparticipants regarding sex and the proportion living at home or in a nursing home. The same geriatrician (KA-R) and a geriatric nurse performed an in- terview and a physical examination at the place of the sub- ject’s residence within 5 months of the anniversary, and a review of medical records was conducted. Not all subjects agreed to a blood test and a full physical examination; ac- cordingly, the TNF  308 G4A polymorphism was analy-

Plasma Cytokines and CRP in Centenarians

Plasma was stored at   801C. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate was used as an anticoagulant. Levels of TNF-a and IL-6 were measured using high sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, and IL-8 was meas- ured using Quantikine ELISA kits from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK), as previously described.3 All samples and standards were run as duplicates, and the mean was used in statistical analyses. The detection limits were 0.1 to 0.2 pg/ mL for TNF-a and IL-6, and 1 ot 2 pg/mL for IL-8. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variations were 16% and 25% for TNF-a, 9% and 15% for IL-6, and less than 10% for IL-8. CRP levels were measured using a

ians) and sex (assuming different baseline hazard functions in men and women) to exclude the possibility of linear and nonlinear interactions between these parameters and the TNF polymorphism. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to detect differences in circulating levels of inflamma- tory markers (dependent variable) in relation to the TNF-a polymorphism (independent variable). Probit plots were used to check for normality in the distribution of inflam- matory markers. To approximate normality, TNF-a was left untransformed, whereas IL-6, IL-8, and CRP were log transformed. Po.05 was considered significant in all e analyses.

Follow-Up of Centenarians

Vital status and time of death were obtained from the Civil Registration System in Denmark in June 2001. The obser- vation period was 5 to 6 years.

Octogenarians and Young Controls

One hundred seventy-eight 85-year-olds, including 66 men, were from the 1914 cohort, Research Center for Prevention and Health, Glostrup, Denmark.19 Blood samples were collected during a home visit as a part of survey of 85-year- olds in 2000. Collection of blood samples from 47 young volunteers (18–30), including 14 men, took place during the same time period.

RESULTS

The TNF  308 G4A genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibration in centenarians and in 85-year-olds and young controls, and there was no difference in the distribution of genotypes or the prevalence of A-allele carriers between the three age groups (Table 1). There was no interaction be- tween sex and the  308 genotype in a multinomial logistic regression analysis including the three age groups as the dependent variable and the three genotypes, sex, and an interaction between sex and genotype as independent var- iables (data not shown).

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 11.0 (SPSS Corp., Chicago, IL) and Stata 8 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Fisher exact test and multinomial lo- gistic regression analyses were used to investigate changes in the distribution of the TNF   308 G4A polymorphism across different age groups. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether dementia was asso- ciated with the polymorphism, adjusted for the effect of sex and an interaction between sex and the polymorphism (cross-sectional analysis). Cox regression models were used to explore associations between the polymorphism and survival (longitudinal analysis). Confounders in the survival analysis included dementia and plasma levels of TNF-a representing known predictors of the mortality risk in the population of centenarians.4 Survival analyses were statis- tically stratified by dementia (assuming different baseline hazard functions in demented and nondemented centenar-

The TNF  308 G4A Polymorphism and Dementia in Centenarians

Sixty-one centenarians were classified as being demented, including 11 men. The GA genotype was associated with a lower prevalence of dementia than the GG genotype, whereas such a difference was not detected with regard to the AA genotype (Table 2). There was no interaction be- tween sex and the genotype; furthermore, the effect of the

tients with AD, the  308 A allele was associated with a mean age of onset 3 years younger than noncarriers of this allele, but there was no difference in the prevalence of gen- otypes in patients and in healthy controls.17 The latter study17 was a case-control study that was designed to detect differences between patients and controls rather than to evaluate the onset age of symptoms in patients. The onset age of dementia is unknown in the present study. Patients with AD displayed higher intrathecal levels of TNF-a than healthy controls, but levels were not related to the TNF  308 G4A polymorphism, suggesting that inflammation in CNS was due to environmental factors rather than ge- netic makeup.6 Unfortunately, intrathecal cytokine levels were not available in the present study. The combination of the  308 A and the  238 wild-type TNF promoter polymorphisms together with microsatellite TNF-a was associated with AD in a family study.25 Combinations of polymorphisms were not evaluated, and the difference in the study populations (family study vs population-based study) makes it difficult to compare data. Finally, in one study, the TNF  850 C4T polymorphism was associated with sporadic AD and VaD,26 but a later study did not confirm these results.27

The TNF  308 G4A Polymorphism and Mortality Risk in Centenarians

Only eight centenarians were still alive in June 2001, 60 to 74 months after the initial survey. A Cox regression analysis was performed with GG as reference. There was no differ- ence in mortality between centenarians with the GG and GA genotypes, whereas those with the AA genotype had greater mortality risk (GA: hazard ratio (HR) 5 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 0.47–1.08, P 5.1; AA: HR 5 3.13, 95% CI 5 1.23–7.97, P 5.02). Hazards were only slightly affected if the analysis was adjusted for the effect of TNF-a levels in plasma and statistically stratified by dementia or sex (data not shown).

The TNF  308 G4A Polymorphism and Circulating Levels of Inflammatory Markers in Centenarians

Levels of Inflammatory Markers in Centenarians There was no difference in plasma levels of TNF-a between the three genotypes within centenarians in a one-way ANOVA (P 5.2), but subjects with the AA genotype tended to have higher plasma levels of TNF-a than the other two genotypes (medians (25th–75th percentiles) GG: 4.3 pg/mL (2.4–6.1), n 5 70; GA: 3.9 pg/mL (2.0–5.5), n 5 35; AA: 7.0 pg/mL (3.9–9.2), n 5 5). There was no difference in circu- lating levels of IL-6, IL-8, or CRP between the three dif- ferent genotypes (data not shown).

The prevalence of the TNF  308 genotypes was un- altered across age groups in the present study. Likewise, there was no difference in the genotype distribution between Finnish nonagenarians and younger controls.28 Nevertheless, in centenarians in the present study, those with the AA genotype tended to have high plasma levels of TNF-a, which was associated with increased mortality risk in the following years, but the low number of centenarians with this genotype calls into question the reliability of this result. However, one may speculate that the TNF   308 A allele is maintained during aging because subjects who are het- erozygous for this polymorphism possess the optimal in- flammatory response against age-degenerative processes in the CNS. It is possible that genetic factors are important for long-term survival in subjects who have already survived to advanced age despite considerable comorbidity. Consistent with this, the IL-6  174 G4C promoter polymorphism was also a risk factor beyond the age of 100 years in a cross- sectional study of different Italian age groups.29

DISCUSSION

The novel finding in the present study was that, contrary to the hypothesis, the TNF  308 GA genotype was associ- ated with a lower prevalence of dementia than the GG genotype in centenarians. This result suggests that a bal- anced TNF-a response possesses the optimal inflammatory response against age-related degenerative processes in the CNS. Consistent with this, it has been demonstrated that TNF-a protects against toxicity mediated by amyloid b- peptide,20 and mice lacking p55 and p75 TNF receptors showed exacerbated neuronal injury in response to focal cerebral ischemia or epileptic seizures than wild-type mice.21 Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid levels of TNF-a and CD95 were negatively correlated in patients with AD, and the incidence of B-cell lymphoma-2 was greater in supernatants of TNF-exposed neuronal cell cultures than in control cultures, suggesting that TNF-a has a neuroprotec- tive effect by inhibiting apoptosis.22 In an animal model of multiple sclerosis, inactivation of the TNF gene converted disease-resistant mice to a state of high susceptibility, and treatment with TNF dramatically reduced disease severity in TNF   /  and TNF1/1 mice, demonstrating that TNF-a limited the extent and duration of severe CNS pathology.23 However, exogenous TNF-a has also been associated with neurotoxicity, and it has been suggested that TNF-a contributes to early neuronal injury but could improve recovery.10 The role of TNF-a in CNS repair is not yet well- described,24 but the present data indicate that this aspect is important in centenarians who have survived to advanced

There was no difference in plasma levels of TNF-a be- tween centenarians with the GG and GA genotypes, in ac- cord with other studies.30 TNF-a tended to be higher in subjects with the AA genotypes in the present study, but the difference was not significant. The power of the ANOVA is poor because of the low number of subjects who had the AA genotype, and the large interpersonal variance in plasma levels of TNF-a makes it impossible to assess whether there is a difference. It has been suggested that a multifactorial process regulates the circulating TNF-a, level whereas local TNF-a production might be of greater importance and un- der more control by specific polymorphisms.16

The sample size is small. It was decided not to pool cen- tenarians with GA and AA genotypes because their asso- ciations with dementia and mortality seemed to differ, but the low number of subjects with AA makes it difficult to evaluate the effect of this genotype, as already discussed. However, differences between GG and GA were unaffected when the AA genotype was excluded from the statistical

analyses. The  308 A allele is strongly associated with the HLA-DR3 allele,12 and it cannot be excluded that the as- sociations between the polymorphism, dementia, and mor- tality risk in the present study reflect linkage with genes of the major histocompatibility complex. Furthermore, the balance in the cytokine network and combinations of dif- ferent cytokine polymorphisms are probably also important for the clinical outcome. Age-related dementia was not subclassified in the present study because it was difficult to make a differentiation; the onset of dementia was often unknown, most centenarians or their relatives did not agree to a brain autopsy, and it was not possible to perform brain imaging to make a proper evaluation of VaD in this frail cohort. However, half of the demented population had atrial fibrillation or hypertension or experienced a stroke/ transient cerebral ischemia, indicating at least a coexisting vascular component.2 In 12% of the demented centenarians a history of a systemic disease with a potential influence on cognitive function was found (e.g., hypothyroidism, vita- min B or folic acid deficiency, and Parkinson’s disease), 12 but these subjects could also have had AD or VaD.2

In conclusion, there was no difference in the distribu- tion of the TNF  308 G4A polymorphism between cen- tenarians, young controls, and octogenarians, but in centenarians, the GA genotype was associated with low prevalence of dementia. It appears that the TNF  308 A allele is maintained during aging because subjects who are heterozygous for this polymorphism posses the optimal in- flammatory response against chronic degenerative process- es in the CNS.

Appendix 1

The diagnosis of dementia was made according to criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) by the World Health Organization, which includes the pattern of daily activities. Every subject was checked in detail for the following variables, which were used to make the ICD-10 criteria operationally as previously described:2

G1(1): A decline in memory: Proxy information regard- ing changes in short-term and long-term memory, ability to recognize other people, find the way home, recall the time of the year; questions regarding orientation and re- call in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), ability to answer questions in a sociodemographic interview.

G

(

): A decline in other cognitive abilities: proxy infor- mation regarding the ability to understand messages and make decisions, judgment, and orientation; MMSE ques- tions regarding attention, learning, serial subtractions or reverse spelling, constructional capacities, use of lan- guage; ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs).

were interfering with IADL items. The specific domains of memory, orientation, and judgments plus problem solving in the CDR were assessed using the same tools as used in the ICD-10. The more complex domain of community affairs was assessed using the ability to make decisions about shopping and financial affairs, whereas the domain of home and hobbies was assessed using information regarding in- terest in reading or having the newspaper or books read aloud, housework, gardening, or hobbies. An extra group (7%) was added as ‘‘probably no dementia,’’ consisting of centenarians in whom sensory deficits or unwillingness to perform all the items in the MMSE made it difficult to rate them as nondemented according to the strict criteria, whereas all other information indicated normal cognitive function. In the present study, only two categories of de- mentia were used: nondementia (healthy, questionable de- mentia, probably no dementia) and dementia (mild, moderate, and severe dementia).

Further support: apraxia, agnosia, aphasia; ability to ognize other people; MMSE questions regarding naming of objects; and IADLs.

The severity of dementia was rated according to the five-level Clinical Dementia Rating scale (healthy, ques- tionable, mild, moderate, and severe dementia). The eval- uation of job functioning was excluded. In each case, a distinct evaluation was made of whether physical handicaps
