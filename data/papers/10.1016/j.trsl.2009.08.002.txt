It has been shown in rodents, rhesus monkeys, and humans, as well as in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, that this ability decreases with age, although the biologic relevance and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear.4,9-11 However, interindi- vidual differences in ability to response to stress can be clarified by studying genetic variants in stress response genes.3

AT A GLANCE COMMENTARY

Background

Translational Significance

We investigate the association of 3 variants (A1267 G in HSPA1B, G190C in HSPA1A, and T2437C in HSPA1L) in heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) with natural longevity in a Xinjiang Hetian Uygur population. Using a candidate gene approach and the promoter functional assessment, our findings suggested that common genetic vari- ants in Hsp70 family might contribute interactively to longevity in the Xinjiang Hetian Uygur popula- tion.

We therefore focused on a population of Xinjiang Hetian Uygur ethnicity, whose percentage of centenar- ians is significantly greater than the average level of the whole country, to explore association of 3 common genetic variants, including A1267 G (rs1061581, exon 1), G190C (rs1043618, 5’ UTR), and T2437C (rs2227956, exon 2) in 3 polymorphic genes (HSPA1B, HSPA1A, and HSPA1L) of the Hsp70 family with natural longevity. In addition, because the G190C variant is assigned in the promoter region of HSPA1A, a func- tional assessment was conducted to evaluate its potential implications in the current study.

scientific research. Longevity is widely accepted as a complex trait whose manifestation is determined by genes, environment, and chance.1 Family studies esti- mate that heritability in human longevity is generally in the range of 20% to 30%,2 which leads to the possibil- ity that several genes with smaller effects account for this complex trait. To search for genes that influence longev- ity is a major avenue to reveal its essence and predict the people accordingly. Recently, Christensen et al3 have written an excellent review on the genetic determinants of human longevity and pointed out that variants in the apolipoprotein E gene had been found to be consistently associated with survival and longevity. However, these variants with a modest effect on lifespan cannot fully ac- count for the longevity prediction, which suggests that some biologic mechanisms implicated in longevity are still unknown. The physiologic features of aging, such as a progressive accumulation of molecular damage and an attenuation of the cellular defense mechanisms, have now shifted the focus of longevity association study to the pathways of stress response genes, espe- cially the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family genes.4

METHODS

Study population. This study was reviewed and ap- proved by the local bioethical committee, and informed written consent was obtained from each subject. A total of 191 unrelated naturally long-lived Uygur subjects (131 men and 60 women) was recruited in this study, in which 52 individuals were more than 100 years old and 139 individuals were within 90–99 years old. Details of this study population have been published previ- ously.12 In brief, the age of the long-lived people was determined based on the following 5 standards:

MgCl , 2.5 mmol/L KCl, and 0.5 units Taq DNA poly- 2 merase. The restriction enzyme NcoI (Promega, Beijing, China) recognized the amplified fragment (627 bp) and digested it into 354 bp and 273 bp when 2437 T was present. After restriction of enzyme treatment, the reac- tion mixture was separated on 2% agarose gels. The primers and amplification conditions for the other 2 var- iants were according to a report of Wu et al.13 Moreover, the accuracy of our screening method was confirmed by direct sequencing of amplified DNA from randomly selected samples (10%), and no difference in results was found between the 2 methods (data not shown).

activity of HSPA1A, the promoter fragment (488 bp) encompassing G190C variant was cloned into the pMD19-T Easy vector (TaKaRa) with the forward primer: 5’-CGG GGT ACC CGC CAT GGA GAC CAA CAC CC (contained KpnI restriction site) and 5’- CCG CTC GAG CCG GTT CCC TGC TCT CTG TC. The confirmation for construction was done by restric- tion analysis as well as DNA sequencing (BGI LifeTech Co., Ltd., Fremont, Calif). The fragment was then inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene at the EcoRI site added between the KpnI/XhoI sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wisc). The insert orientation in the HSPA1A-pGL3 con- struct was confirmed by restriction assay. Human lung carcinoma A549 cells cultivated in FK12 medium con- taining 10% fetal calf serum were plated into 6-well dishes (5 3 105/well), grown for 20 h, and transfected by the lipofectin method (New England Biolabs, Ips- wich, Mass). The test plasmid (HSPA1A-pGL3 4.0 mg) and internal Renilla luciferase control plasmid (phRL- TK, 1.0 mg) were cotransfected into cells, which were grown for 48 h. The cells were incubated at 42(cid:2)C for 1 h and harvested 5 h after the heat treatment. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured with a luninometer by using a dual luciferase assay sys- tem. Each promoter activity was measured directly by the ratio of the firefly luciferase level to the Renilla lucif- erase level. For each reporter construct, 5 independent

DNA extraction and phenotype measurements. Blood

samples, anticoagulated with 2% ethylenediaminetetra- acetic acid, were drawn for DNA extraction and bio- chemical examination. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells using the proteinase K/phenol/ chloroform purification, followed by ethanol precipita- tion, and stored in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L Na -EDTA, pH 8.0. Body weight and height, as well 2 as blood pressure levels, were calibrated according to the last measurement at the time of survey. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Blood pressure was measured at the right arm with a conventional mer- cury sphygmomanometer after the subjects rested at least 5 min. Plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A, and apolipoprotein B concentrations were determined enzy- matically using available kits and an autoanalyzer in Xinjiang Medical University. Plasma low-density lipo- protein cholesterol was estimated using Friedewald’s formula. Fasting plasma glucose was detected by the Glucorder analyzer (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

Genotyping. The genotypes of the 3 studied variants were determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. With respect to the HSPA1L 2437 T/C vari- ant, the sequences of the forward and reverse primers were GTC CCT GGG GCT GGA GAC GG and GTG ATG ATA GGG TTA CAC ATC TGC T, respectively. PCR amplification was carried out in a PTC-200 MJ Re- search Peltier Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mass) for 35 cycles with denaturation at 94(cid:2)C for 45 s, annealing at 60(cid:2)C for 45 s, and extension at 72(cid:2)C for 45 s. All amplifications were performed with 50-100 ng of DNA in a total volume of 25 mL containing 10 pmol of each primer, 200 mmol/L dNTPs, 2.0 mmol/L

Statistical analysis. Database management and simple statistical calculations were conducted by SAS software version 9.1.3 (Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The means of continuous variables were compared by unpaired t-test. The c2 test was used to assess the goodness of fit between the observed allele frequencies and the expected counterparts by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to evaluate the differences in genotype and allele distributions between the 2 groups. A trend analysis was performed using a 1-way analysis of variance. A 2-tailed P . 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

people (mean age, 67 years). Except for age, no statisti- cal significance was observed in terms of gender, BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and plasma lipid-related biomarkers between long-lived people and short-lived people (P . 0.05).

The EH/EH1 program was employed to estimate and the haplotype frequencies between longevity control groups by c2 test from a series of 2 3 2 con- tables by combining other haplotypes. To in- study power, only haplotypes with a frequency than 3% were considered for analysis. An inter- analysis was implemented in the open-source software package (v.1.0.0), which is available www.epistasis.org. Using the MDR constructive function, we constructed all possible combina- of 1 to 3 variants. The genetic data were collapsed 2 categories with high and low risk in each cell. An dendrogram was applied to visualize the of the dependencies.

For the genotype/allele distributions of 3 studied var- iants, no evidence was found for Hardy-Weinberg dis- equilibrium in both groups (P . 0.05). As presented in Table II, no significant differences were apparent between the 2 groups in the genotype and allele distribu- tions of all the studied variants by single-locus analysis (P . 0.05). After stratifing the study popualtion by gender, we still failed to observed any differences for these distributions (data not shown).

The omnibus haplotype test showed marginal associ- ation with longevity (overall P 5 0.019). Of the 6 different haplotypes with a frequency greater than 3% for the 3 variants, haplotypes A-G-C and A-C-T were

Because the G190C variant was located in the pro- moter region of HSPA1A, we assessed the promoter activity by measuring the ratio of firefly luciferase activ- ity to Renilla luciferase activity in A549 cells (Fig 2). No significant differences were observed between 190 G and 190C alleles in both control (P 5 0.562) and heat- inducible (P 5 0.463) A549 cells.

When using the most common haplotype A-G-T as a sta- tistical reference, haplotypes A-G-C and A-C-T had a significant 3.46- and 4.51-fold increased tendency for longevity, respectively (P 5 0.025 and P 5 0.016, re- spectively).

Table IV compares the age distributions by Hsp70 genotypes among long-lived people. Compared with 1267AA homozygotes, carriers with 1267GG genotype had a tendency of living longer (P . 0.05). The same result was noted for 190GC heterozygotes in comparison with 190CC genotype carriers. As for T2437C variant, the different allele carriers (2437TT and CC) both had an increased tendency for longevity, especially for the

DISCUSSION

It is generally believed that all organisms at the cellu- lar level respond to stress by synthesizing heat shock proteins at the expense of other proteins and the ability of human cells to respond to heat stress decreases with aging.14,15 The possibility could not be excluded that longevity might be partly heat-stress mediated. There- fore, proteins that participate in heat-stress cascade and its regulation are potential candidates, whose encoded genes may contain sequence variation contributing to the inherited tendency for longevity. We performed a candidate gene-longevity association study as well as the promoter activity assessment to explore the possible involvement of Hsp70 genes variants in susceptibility to longevity in a Xinjiang Hetian Uygur population. The Hetian city was listed as 1 of the 4 longevity districts in the world by the Institute of International Natural Medicine.16 This special population can offer us an inter- esting opportunity to establish an ideal model to decipher genetic underpinnings of natural longevity.

ing the amount of information gained about longevity status by putting 2 variants together using the MDR function. The interaction information analysis indicated that variants G190C and T2437C, connected with a red line, had a strong synergistic effect, whereas the A1267 G variant was connected with the other by a green line, which suggests a loss of information that can be inter- preted as redundancy or correlation. The pattern of ‘‘high-risk’’ (dark gray) and ‘‘low-risk’’ (light grey) genotype combinations was nonlinear across the 9 two-locus genotype cells, which represented interaction as suggested by the interaction analysis.

results of Ross et al’s One possibility is based on the different selection criteria applied to study groups. For example, in Ross et al’s study,18 the short-lived people aged 19–45 years were chosen at random from the archival DNA bank of normal healthy Caucasian in- dividuals, whereas our short-lived people aged 65–70 years were selected on the basis of many years’ fol- low-up and stringent entrance criteria (as described in Methods). Another possibility is the relative small num- ber (n 5 53) of short-lived people in the current study, which might cover the statistical significance between genetic markers and longevity. We agree that confirma- tion in a larger, well-designed study is crucial.

Haplotype analysis, studies single genetic variants in their combina- simultaneously, has a higher complexity level single-locus analysis and can provide additional with respect to the effect of genetic interac- especially when these alleles have a synergistic Our haplotype analysis indicated that haplo- A-G-C and A-C-T had a genetic predisposition live longer. A previous study by Singh et al4 examin- haplotypes of Hsp70 family and longevity suggested haplotype harboring 1267A and 2437C alleles had worse survival as compared with in cross-sectional and cohort studies, which inconsistent with the current results. Furthermore, noted that the linkage patterns were heterogeneous different ethnic populations. For example, G and T2437C variants were in moderate linkage (D’ 5 0.6–0.8) in Singh et al’s study,4 in weak linkage disequilibrium (D’ . 0.5) in study (data not shown). Given the importance of nat- selection in human evolution, haplotype structure or might be dissimilar among populations of dif- origins.

The most noteworthy finding of this study was a posi- tive association between the haplotype constructs of 3 studied variants and natural longevity in Uygur ethnic- ity, although no significance was observed in a single- locus analysis. Furthermore, this positive association was strengthened by interaction analysis, which suggests that G190C and T2437C variants might have an interact- ing effect on longevity. This is the first study to report the interactive association of Hsp70 genes variants with natural longevity in Chinese.

Since the study relating Hsp70 family variants with longevity was first reported by Altomare et al17 in an Ital- ian population, many studies provide support for the involvement of Hsp70 genes in the long period of surviving.18,19 A study by Ross et al18 observed an increased frequency of the 2437 T allele (83.3%) of HSPA1L in an aged Irish population, which was almost equal to that (82.2%) in the current study. However, our results failed to find the significant association of 2437C allele with longevity, which was not in line with the

The MDR, which is nonparametric and genetic model- free in design, is widely believed to be an analytical data- mining method to facilitate the identification of complex genetic interactions. Moreover, this method has been successfully applied to detect and characterize gene- gene and gene-environment interactions in case-control and discordant-sib-pair studies with relatively small sample.21-23 An application of MDR can, to some extent, strengthen the validity of our results and statistically

pret the interactive association of Hsp70 genes variants with human longevity.

overcome the small sample size in this study, although some underlying limitations of this method, such as computational intensiveness, indistinct interpretation, lack of sensitivity, and heterogeneity-free assumption as summarized by Manuguerra et al.24 Using MDR, we identified a strong 2-locus interaction between G190C and T2437C variants. In view of both haplotype and interaction results, we refer that the genetic frame- work within these 2 variants confers a predisposition to longevity in the presence of only 1 minor allele (190 G-2437C and 190C-2437 T) for these 2 variants, whereas the 2 minor allele combination (190C-2437C) is unfavorable for longevity. This might indicate the existence of interaction because the coexistent minor al- leles have the opposite role with the only 1 minor allele. Unfortunately in the current study, we failed to find any significance in the promoter activity of HSPA1A for G190C alleles. It is possible that G190C variant can be considered a possible marker, in linkage disequilibrium with another functionally relevant variant interacting with T2437C in affecting structure or expression of Hsp70 genes. However, because of the complexity of genetic interaction in human longevity, a decision must not be made until functional studies confirm or refute these findings.

In sum, we demonstrated a strong interaction of the 3 studied variants in Hsp70 family with natural longevity in the Xinjiang Hetian Uygur population. Independent replication in other populations and subsequent func- tional validation are also required to confirm and inter-
