Human longevity has been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) coding region polymorphisms as well as the C150T polymorphism in the non-coding region in previous studies, especially in Europeans. This study investigated the potential association between the mtDNA C150T polymorphism and longevity in a Han Chinese population. Leukocyte mtDNAs from two groups of a Han Chinese population living in Dujiangyan city of Sichuan province - including 556 longevous individuals (90-108 years old) and 403 unrelated controls - were analyzed. mtDNA haplogroups were determined by sequencing control regions and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in coding regions. Our results did not show a universal association between the mitochondrial C150T polymorphism and longevity in this population. Even when mtDNA haplogroups defined by C150T and gender were taken into account, there was no significant association with longevity. In conclusion, the mtDNA C150T polymorphism could not present an accumulation in an elderly Han Chinese population. Previous association studies might have been influenced by nuclear DNA and/or environmental factors.

Introduction

Numerous studies have investigated the putative association between the C150T mutation and longevity in different populations, leading to paradoxical findings. These studies have motivated broader investigations to clarify whether the C150T mutation contributes to human longevity and whether the association is universal or unique to particular ethnic groups. Most studies have focused on European populations, including Italian (Dato et al., 2004; De Benedictis et al., 1999; Rose et al., 2007), Finnish (Niemi et al., 2003, 2005), Irish (Ross et al., 2001), Spanish (Dominguez-Garrido et al., 2009), and Ashkenazi Jewish populations (Iwata et al., 2007). Populations from Japan (Niemi et al., 2005) and Xinjiang province in China (Ren et al., 2008) have also been investigated, but the former study was limited by a small sample size, and the latter was limited to Uygur subjects. To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the putative association between the C150T mutation and longevity in a Han Chinese population, which is the largest ethnic group in the world.

The relationship between the human ageing process and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) changes - including germ-line point mutations, somatic point mutations, and fragment deletions - has been intensely investigated over the last decade. One of the most controversial associations reported is that of human longevity with a C150T mutation on mtDNA. An early report of mtDNA haplogroup J enrichment in elderly people focused on male centenarians of northern Italy (De Benedictis et al., 1999). Subsequently, the C150T mutation defining haplogroup J2 was revealed to be the true factor associated with longevity (Niemi et al., 2003). At the same time, an analysis of nascent heavy mtDNA strands revealed a new origin of replication at position 149, substituting for that at position 151, only in cell samples carrying the C150T mutation (Zhang et al., 2003). Indeed, a number of studies with positive or negative results have been published in this area based on different populations.

We set out to explore the possible association between the mtDNA C150T polymorphism and longevity in Han Chinese subjects living in Dujiangyan city in Sichuan province, China. Dujiangyan city is renowned for having a longevous population in China, with a frequency of centenarians of more than 0.01% as indexed in the 5th National Census in China inhistory of human populations through the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been a subject of much investigation. However, some associations between mtDNA haplogroups and longevity have been limited to specific populations and could not be replicated in other studies. The present study investigated the association between the C150T polymorphism and longevity in Han Chinese populations using Pearson Chi-Square analysis. The results showed that the two populations had similar mtDNA genetic backgrounds, and the overall haplogroup frequencies were not significantly different. The C150T mutation frequencies in European populations were distinct from those in East Asian populations, with much higher frequencies observed in the Chinese population. While the study did not find a robust association between the C150T polymorphism and longevity in Han Chinese populations, other mtDNA variants might still be associated with human longevity. Functional studies on mtDNA variants are required to further our understanding of the influence of mitochondrial/nuclear genetic background and environmental factors on human lifespan.
