Based on substantial evidence from model organisms, it is clear that mitochondria play a pivotal role in aging and lifespan. However, the effects of mitochondrial genome variations on longevity and longevity-related phenotypes in Chuang people in China have yet to be established. By genotyping 15 variants for 10 haplogroups in 738 Chuang subjects, including 367 long-lived individuals and 371 controls, we found that haplogroup F was significantly associated with longevity in females of the Zhuang population of China (p=0.003, OR: 2.01, 95%CI: 1.26-3.19). Additionally, haplogroup F was related to higher HDL levels (p<0.05) in long-lived individuals. Further analysis suggests that the non-synonymous variant m.13928GNC in haplogroup F was also associated with longevity in female Zhuang Chinese, which might account for the beneficial effect of F. 

Longevity and successful aging are complex traits influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors (Christensen et al., 2006; Glatt et al., 2007). A better understanding of mechanisms for successful aging and longevity has important implications for lowering the risk of age-related diseases and disability. Studies in model organisms have found hundreds of genetic variants that lead to life extension. Population studies have suggested that genetics contribute to variations in human lifespan by approximately 25% (Christensen et al., 2006). However, the mechanisms by which genetics contribute to human longevity and successful aging are still not clear.

A growing body of evidence indicates that mtDNA variants play a pivotal role in the aging process. For example, some mtDNA mutations or haplogroups (i.e., the combination of several common mtDNA variants) are associated with age-related degenerative diseases (Chinnery et al., 2001; Feder et al., 2009; Fuku et al., 2007; Tanaka, 2002; van der Walt et al., 2003). However, others are associated with increased longevity, such as 9055A in the French (Ivanova et al., 1998) and Irish, 5178A (Tanaka et al., 1998) in the Japanese, and 150T in the Irish, Finnish, and Japanese (Niemi et al., 2003, 2005; Zhang et al., 2003). MtDNA can be divided into haplogroups according to the ancient polymorphisms present in its coding region and D-loop. The European population is almost distributed among the nine haplogroups designated as H, I, J, K, T, U, V, W, and X. In contrast, haplogroups A, B, C, D, F, and G and certain subclusters of macrohaplogroups M and N are characteristic of Asian populations. Haplogroups A, B, C and D are specific to Amerindian populations and haplogroups L1, L2 and L3 to African populations.

MtDNA haplogroup J confers a higher chance to attain longevity than other mtDNA haplogroups in three independent populations in Northern Italy, Northern Ireland, and Finland (De Benedictis et al., 1999; Niemi et al., 2003; Ross et al., 2001). A significant enrichment of subhaplogroups D4a, D5 and D4b2b was shown in long-living Japanese individuals (Alexe et al., 2007; Bilal et al., 2008).

The study subjects were from Bama, China, and included 474 long-lived individuals and 264 controls. The long-lived group comprised 107 men and 367 women (mean [SD] age: 97.5 [6.03] and 94.3 [5.53] years old for men and women, respectively; range: 90-111 years old). The control group comprised 107 men and 264 women (mean [SD] age: 47.0 [5.11] and 46.6 [4.65] years old for men and women, respectively; range: 35-65 years old). All subjects from Bama were unrelated and belonged to the Zhuang population, which is one of the largest ethnic groups in mainland China with approximately 15,000,000 persons; it is second only to the Han population.

Additionally, circumstantial evidence suggests that mtDNA variations could influence aging and longevity either by bearingmutations that can modulate mitochondrial function or rely on complex relationships between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (Santoro et al., 2006). Cybrid cell models have shown that mtDNA haplogroups H or J can differently modulate the expression of some nuclear genes related to the stress response, such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, and interleukin-6, not only under basal conditions but also under oxidative stress conditions (Bellizzi et al., 2006; Santoro et al., 2006).

Standard demographic indicators of quality of age reporting in the Chuang population in China were 100.1±104.3 and 2.3±2.9, respectively, based on the 1982, 1990, and 2000 census data (Zeng, 2009). According to the United Nations' criteria, a Whipple's Index >105 and a Myer's Index >10 indicate good quality of age reporting. Thus, we are confident that the age information of the subjects who belong to Chuang ethnic group recruited in this study is reliable. In the control group of this study, we excluded individuals with one or two parents who survived to 90 years old or above, and in fact, they were not able to be randomly chosen. Twelve baseline and metabolic indexes such as age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum total triglyceride (TG), serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) were measured in all selected longevity and control subjects.

However, the effect of mtDNA haplogroups on longevity is population-specific because haplogroups are defined by common mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNP) in each ethnic group, and the distribution of mtSNP allele frequency varies considerably depending on the population studied. For example, the mtDNA haplogroup D (characteristic of m.5178CNA) in the Japanese population was associated with longevity. However, the association between haplogroup D and longevity has not been found in southern Chinese populations (Yao et al., 2002b). Similarly, the association between haplogroup J and longevity was found in the population of northern Italy but not of southern Italy (Dato et al., 2004).

The research ethics committee of Beijing Hospital approved this study. Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled subjects, and the study was carried out in full compliance with all principles of the Helsinki Accord.

The contribution of mtDNA variations to longevity and longevity-related phenotypes in the Chuang people in China has not been established. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that mtDNA variations could be associated with exceptional longevity in the Chuang Chinese population, and we speculated that supporting evidence for this association might be gained by further studying the effect of mtDNA variations on longevity-related phenotypes such as serum lipid or blood glucose levels. Previous studies have shown that subjects with exceptional longevity have favorable lipid profiles (Arai et al., 2001; Atzmon et al., 2005; Barzilai et al., 2003; Paolisso et al., 1997), and these phenotypes are associated with several genetic variants located in the nuclear genome (Barzilai et al., 2003; Koropatnick et al., 2008; Pablos-Mendez et al., 1997; Rontu et al., 2006). However, conclusive evidence linking mtDNA variations to metabolic phenotypes such as serum lipid levels or blood glucose levels is still not clear among individuals with successful aging.

2.2. Study strategy

To control for population stratification, we restricted our analysis to a single ethnic group (Chuang) in a genetically isolated, homogeneous local population from a rural county (Bama) in southern China. We chose two samples of longevity and younger control subjects that have not been matched by age to identify the association between mtDNA variations and longevity. The strategy was as follows: 1) we identified 25 haplogroups/subhaplogroups that include 225 mtDNA variants in long-lived individuals by sequencing twenty complete mitochondrial genomes and constructing a phylogenetic tree in preliminary study; 2) we determined which mtDNA haplogroups were associated with longevity in the Bama Chuang population by the case-control association analysis within a dataset of 738 subjects consisting of 367 centenarians and 371 controls; 3) we examined the effect of gender on longevity-associated mtDNA variations by stratification analysis for women and men separately; and 4) we gathered further supporting evidence of the association of mtDNA variations with longevity by analyzing the relationship of mtDNA20 individuals (selected from 367 longevity subjects) (age range 90-107 years, mean [SD] age, 96.4 [5.31] years) who were of normal physical, psychological, and cognitive functioning were amplified by polymerase chain reaction in a total of 34 overlapping fragments of approximately 700 bp and sequenced by Invitrogen Corporation (No.7 Rong Chang East Street, Long Sheng Industry Park, Building 204 BDA, Beijing 100176, P.R. China). The detailed conditions are listed in Supplementary Table 1. For the complete mitochondrial genome sequencing, altogether 225 mtDNA variants were found in long-lived individuals using the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) (Andrews et al., 1999) as the reference.

2. Subjects and methods

2.1. Subjects

In this study, longevity subjects were classified as participants who had survived to age 90 years or more, with younger controls being less than 65 years of age. 738 individuals from Bama were recruited, including 367 long-lived individuals and 371 local and unrelated younger controls. The individuals with exceptional longevity included 269 women and 98 men (mean [SD] age: 95.4 [4.84] and 95.1 [4.51] years). The phylogenetic tree of 20 complete mtDNA sequences was created by the neighbor-joining program (1000 bootstrapped).

2.5. Statistical methods

MEGA version 3.1 (Kumar et al., 2004) was used to create the phylogenetic tree. Then, using sequence alignment and sequence comparisons, the positions of the individual nucleotide changes were incorporated into nodes of the tree. Each mtDNA was assigned to its respective haplogroup as described in the literature (Kivisild et al., 2002; Kong et al., 2006; Kong et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2004; Yao et al., 2002a). Coding-region mutation motifs were mainly employed for the definition of the haplogroup (Bandelt et al., 2000). Each mtDNA sequence was analyzed for possible sequencing errors, identified by base changes inconsistent with the most likely haplogroup. Sequences with multiple potential errors were excluded from the dataset and subsequently re-sequenced. Based on our phylogeny (Fig. 1) and East Asian haplogroups as previously described (Kivisild et al., 2002; Kong et al., 2003, 2006; Tanaka et al., 2004; Yao et al., 2002a), 25 haplogroups/subhaplogroups in long-lived Bama individuals were identified, as shown in Fig. 1. And the frequencies of all observed haplogroups/subhaplogroups are presented in Supplementary Table 2. All statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS 11.5 software package. An unpaired Student's t-test and a chi-squared test were used to compare quantitative and qualitative phenotypes and demographic data between long-lived subjects and controls. The chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were carried out to explore the association of each mtDNA variant or haplogroup with longevity. We performed gender stratification analysis by Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test. The p-value, odds ratios (ORs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. For haplogroup analyses, we compared each haplogroup with all other haplogroups pooled into one group. Because there are no recombination mechanisms in mitochondria, some of the mtSNPs in the present study are tightly linked to each other. Since some of the markers are in linkage disequilibrium and the haplogroup comparisons are not independent, p values reported for mtSNPs and haplogroups are not adjusted for multiple testing (Rosa et al., 2008). A significant threshold was set at p<0.05.

3. Results

3.1. The characteristics of the study subjects

Ten candidate haplogroups/subhaplogroups that included 15 common mtDNA variants were selected as our working loci for the association study and further genotyping (details in Supplementary Table 3). Genotypes of 15 mtDNA variants were analyzed by PCR or restriction site-generating PCR (RG-PCR) followed by restriction digestion analysis. The mtDNA variants 10,400, 15,487, 6455, 4071, 12,811, 3010, 3970 and 10,310 were genotyped by RG-PCR-RFLP using a base change on the 3 terminal of the forward or reverse primer to form a(N=367) (N=371)

Sex differences exist in longevity, with women living longer than men.
When we stratified the Bama cohort by gender, we found a significant association of longevity in females for haplogroup F (p=0.003, OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.26-3.19) and the three mtSNPs (m.3970C>T, m13928G>C and m10310G>A) that defined haplogroup F (p=0.001, OR: 1.970, 95% CI: 1.30-2.98; p=0.004, OR: 1.799, 95% CI: 1.20-2.68 and p=0.003, OR: 2.010, 95% CI: 1.26-3.19). However, there was no such significant association found in males (Table 3). Additionally, subhaplogroup F3 and one mtDNA variant (m10320G>A) in subhaplogroup F3 were slightly associated with longevity.

3.4. mtDNA variation associated with longevity-related phenotype

To attain supporting evidence for the association of mtDNA variations with longevity, we tested the relationship of FBG, TG, TC, HDL-c and LDL-c levels with mtDNA haplogroup F among the Bama population. The results showed that mtDNA haplogroup F was associated with markedly higher HDL-c levels (p<0.05), but only in long-lived subjects (13.5%). There was a significant statistical difference for haplogroup F between the long-lived and control groups for the two genders combined (p=0.010, OR: 1.703, 95% CI: 1.153-2.514, see Table 2), and the power was 85.5% by the statistical power calculator (http://www.dssresearch.com/toolkit/sscalc/size_p2.asp). To further determine the influence of haplogroup F on longevity, every mtDNA variant (m.3970C>T, m.13928G>C or m.10310G>A) in haplogroup F was analyzed by the association study. The three mtDNA variants were found to be consistently associated with longevity for the two genders combined (p=0.009, OR: 1.602, 95% CI: 1.134-2.262; p=0.021, OR: 1.507, 95% CI: 1.075-2.114 and p=0.010, OR: 1.703, 95% CI: 1.153-2.514, respectively, see Table 2).

4. Discussion

Although the mechanism by which mtDNA variation influences mitochondrial function, longevity and successful aging is unknown, the present study provides evidence of association between mtDNA haplogroups and longevity. At present, there are three methods in longevity studies (Christensen et al., 2006), i.e., case-control studies (KHaplogroup F was widespread in Southeast Asia and at moderate frequencies in Northeast Asia (Li et al., 2007). Alternatively, to explain the difference, we hypothesize certain interactions between mitochondrial haplogroups and nuclear polymorphisms and/or environmental factors. Second, the association of haplogroup F with longevity might be specific in the isolated Bama population. Bama is surrounded by steep mountains, resulting in poor transportation and communication with outside territories throughout history. These external factors resulted in social isolation. And it is quite likely that this haplogroup has had few opportunities for gene flow. In the isolated population, haplogroup F might be a protective factor for successful aging. The present results need to be replicated in additional populations.

Third, there were three mtSNPs (3970CNT, 13928GNC, and 10310GNA) in haplogroup F that were consistently associated with longevity in the women of the Bama Zhuang population. Among haplogroup F-specific mtSNPs, m.13928GNC, which causes an amino acid change Ser531Thr in the MT-ND5 protein, would potentially seem to be a functionally relevant polymorphism (see Supplementary Table 4).

Table 3 shows the distribution of mtDNA haplogroups and variants between long-lived subjects and controls in female and male Chuang populations. C is a subhaplogroup of M8, M7bc and M7b12 are subhaplogroups of M7, D4 and D4a are subhaplogroups of D, F3 is a subhaplogroup of F. #Others haplogroup categories include all other haplotypes except four haplogroups (M8, M7, D and F).

Note: Data in italics indicates p<0 .05, OR=odds ratio, and a confidence interval of95%."F+" indicates subjects with haplogroup F, and "F-" suggests subjects without haplogroup F. FBG refers to fasting blood glucose, TG to serum total triglyceride, TC to serum total cholesterol, HDL-c to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and LDL-c to low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Further study of these factors could be important to obtain a clearer relationship between mtDNA variations and longevity. Supplementary materials related to this article can be found online. The successful aging of individuals may be explained by decreased production of ROS from mitochondria. Further studies are needed to examine whether the production of superoxides or ROS from cybrids carrying mtDNA of haplogroup F is lower than that in cybrids carrying mtDNA of other haplogroups. However, the actual effect of the mtSNP m.13928GNC on mitochondrial function remains to be examined. The present study showed that haplogroup F was associated with longevity only in females, whereas no significant association was found in males. Although the male group is small in size in the gender-stratified analyses, previous studies have shown that women live longer than men and the effect of genetics on successful aging differs between females and males (et al., 2010). The gender difference in the association of the haplogroup with longevity may be attributable to differences in biological background such as sex hormones and extrinsic factors like smoking (Candore et al., 2006; Ordovas, 2007). These differences might explain the present observation that women but not men were distinctly influenced by the differences among mitochondrial haplogroups. Therefore, our results suggest that haplogroup F has a protective effect only on women and not on men. In addition, our analysis indicated that subhaplogroup F3 at the branch level of haplogroup F was associated with longevity and successful aging in female subjects. However, in the present study, the frequency of subhaplogroup F3 is very low (4.9% in long-lived populations and 3.0% in controls), and the power in genetic association would fall off for this low frequency. Therefore, the association of subhaplogroup F3 with longevity needs to be ascertained by replication in larger sample sizes. None of the authors have a conflict of interest. The authors thank the subjects for donating DNA samples.

In this analysis, we found that the mtDNA haplogroup F was not only associated with longevity but also had an effect on serum lipid levels. Long-lived subjects with mtDNA haplogroup F demonstrated higher HDL-c levels. Higher HDL-c has been shown to be associated with a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (Agoston-Coldea et al., 2007; Jones, 2008; Woodward et al., 2007), all of which may increase mortality. However, we observed an effect of the mtDNA haplogroup F on metabolism in long-lived populations but not in controls. It is tempting to speculate that because there were different serum lipid levels between the long-lived subjects and controls, no matter what their mtDNA variants, multiple mechanisms other than mtDNA haplogroup F possibly maintain lipid metabolism. In addition, we list some phenotypes of longevity and compare them with those of control subjects in Table 1. All of these phenotypes are quantitative traits that are complicated by a great deal of interplay between genes and environment (Turnpenny and Ellard, 2005). In the present study, several phenotypes in Table 1 are significantly different between the two groups of subjects. Aging is a predominant reason for contributing to the difference in these traits. Although our results show that there is statistical significance for mtDNA haplogroups between the two groups of subjects, we are still not sure that the difference in these traits in Table 1 is due to the differences in mtDNA haplogroups.
5. Conclusions
Haplogroup F may be associated with successful aging and exceptional longevity in women of the Bama Zhuang population. Haplogroup F in long-lived individuals was associated with higher HDL levels, which supported the association of mtDNA variants with successful aging and longevity. Although functional analysis is needed, the amino acid change S531T (m.13928GNC) in the MT-ND5 gene might account for the beneficial effect of haplogroup F. In addition, because longevity and successful aging are complex traits affected by local environments and other additional factors, these factors might interact with mtDNA variations in long-lived individuals and eventually increase desirable longevity.
