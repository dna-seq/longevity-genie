ABSTRACT

SDC4 alleles affect lipid profile in elderly subjects and may in part mediate the link between aging, longevity, extracellular matrix, metabolism, and syndecans adhesion and behavior (Morgan et al., 2007; Xian et al., 2010). That signaling between cells and the ECM plays a pivotal role in tissue/organ homeostasis. Sdc mutant flies also display less fat and glycogen reserves and lower metabolic activity than invertebrates. Humans contain four SDC genes. Three of them, SDC1, SDC2, and SDC3 (Miller et al., 2011), suggests that this SDC4 genetic variant might molecular link between SDC4 and lipid profile strongly motivate further studies to determine how SDC4 genotypes can affect human health.

2. METHODS

2.1. Study subjects

The study was carried out in a cohort of 624 unrelated subjects (287 males and 337 females, age of Calabria, Italy. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrolling in the study.

2.2. Phenotypic measurements

HbA1c was chosen as a clinical marker of CHD because levels of HbA1c between 6.0 and clothes and without shoes. Blood samples were withdrawn after a 12-h overnight fast and analysis. The selected SNPs are reported in Table and a primer extension reaction using the mass extension primer and the terminator. The 95%; however, genotyping completion rate was lower than 65% for rs6104125.

model]). For each model, a z-score was returned, representing the z-statistics for the analyses, with a pmodel referred to the p value for the most likely genetic model. SNPs influenced gene expression, we explored the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)

3.1. SCD4 association with longevity

Longevity, however, was not significant after adjusting for multiple testing (Table 2); hence, caution is needed in interpreting this finding. The z-statistics of these models indicated that rs2228384. The haplotype analysis for these two polymorphic sites revealed that, although the Thus, haplotype analysis confirmed association results with the single markers.
