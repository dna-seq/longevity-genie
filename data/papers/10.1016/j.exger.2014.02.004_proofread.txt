The ApoE gene is linked to Alzheimer's disease or cardiovascular disease, but its role in exceptional longevity (EL) is unclear. Our main objective was to determine if the ApoE gene is connected to EL using a case-control study. We compared the allele/genotype frequencies of ApoE among three cohorts: cases (centenarians, most with one or more major disease conditions; n = 163, 100-111 years) and healthy controls (n = 1039, 20-85 years) from Spain; disease-free cases (centenarians; n = 79, 100-104 years) and healthy controls (n = 597, age 27-81 years) from Italy; and cases (centenarians and semi-supercentenarians, most with one or more major disease conditions; n = 729, 100-116 years) and healthy controls (n = 498, 23-59 years) from Japan. Our main findings were twofold. First, the 4-allele was negatively associated with EL in the three cohorts with the following odds ratio (OR) values (adjusted by sex): 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33, 0.94), P = 0.030 (Spain); 0.41 (95%CI: 0.18, 0.99), P = 0.05 (Italy); and 0.35 (95%CI: 0.26, 0.57), P <0.001 (Japan). Second, though no association was found in the Spanish cohort (OR = 1.42 (95%CI: 0.89, 2.26), P = 0.145), the 2-allele was positively associated with EL in the Italian (OR = 2.14 (95%CI: 1.18, 3.45), P = 0.01) and Japanese subjects (OR = 1.81 (95%CI: 1.25, 2.63), P = 0.002). Despite the limitations of case-control designs, our data suggest that the ApoE gene might be a candidate to influence EL. The 4-allele appears to decrease the likelihood of reaching EL among individuals of different ethnic/geographic origins. An additional novel finding of our study was that the 2-allele might favor EL, at least in the Italian and Japanese cohorts. The ApoE is associated with having several age-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD, including coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease) (Kumar et al., 2012) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Liu et al., 2013), including late-onset AD (Sadigh-Eteghad et al., 2012), with the 4-allele being the unfavorable allele as it increases mortality risk (Christensen et al., 2006). Recent data also support an association of ApoE and mortality in long-lived individuals, with a genome-wide linkage analysis with nonagenarians identifying ApoE as a longevity gene (Beekman et al., 2013). This is in agreement with the results of a recent case-control genome-wide association study comparing long-lived individuals (mean age: 99.7 years) and younger controls from Germany (Nebel et al., 2011). However, whether ApoE influences exceptional longevity (EL), i.e., reaching 100+ years of age, is more controversial.

In the Spanish cohort, we conducted a longitudinal study of older subjects with no or mild cognitive impairment aimed at the early detection of AD. The history of past and current diseases was collected by personal interview with the participants. Exclusion criteria were having a stroke or traumatic brain injury with severe physical or cognitive impairment, clinically evident cancer, major psychiatric disorders, or severe systemic diseases (e.g., chronic renal or liver failure). None of the subjects had criteria of cognitive impairment after being submitted to an extensive neuropsychological battery that included: Mini-mental-State Examination (MMSE), Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), Verbal Fluency Task (P, M & R), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF), Drawing Clock Test, Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)-15 of Reisberg, and Global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). We excluded all subjects with CDR N 0 from the present study.

Most reports indicate a lower frequency of the ApoE 4-allele in centenarians compared with younger controls in French (Blanche et al., 2001; Schachter et al., 1994), Finnish (PCR using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. The Spanish cohort consisted of two groups: centenarians (175 cases, age range 100-111 years, with 144 women and 31 men), and healthy controls (1081 individuals aged 20-85 years, with 622 women and 459 men). All participants were of the same Caucasian (Spanish) descent for three generations and spoke Spanish as their mother tongue. The Japanese cohort also had two groups: centenarians (742 cases, age range 100-116 years, with 623 women and 119 men), and healthy controls (499 individuals aged 23-59 years, with 356 women and 143 men). The DNA samples of the Japanese centenarians were collected from two prospective cohorts: the Tokyo Centenarians Study (TCS) and the Semi-Supercentenarians Study in Japan (SSC-J). The Italian centenarians were recruited mainly through general practitioners in the community, representing a convenience sample that had been previously described. All Italian centenarians were free of major age-related diseases such as severe cognitive impairment, clinically evident cancer, CVD, renal insufficiency, or severe physical impairment, with only some having decreased visual or auditory acuity. Controls were in good physical health with exclusion criteria being the presence of major CVD or cerebrovascular disease, cancer, dementia, chronic autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, renal or hepatic failure, and major psychiatric disorders. Inclusion criteria for the control group were being men or women aged below 60 years, and free of diagnosed stroke, cardiac disease, and chronic renal failure. ApoE allele/genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls in each cohort using Fisher's exact test. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.PCR was performed in the genomics laboratory of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (Tokyo, Japan). Total DNA was extracted from venous blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). ApoE genotyping was carried out in Fall 2013 using custom-designed TaqMan SNP genotyping assays [IDs: C___3084793_20 for Cys112Arg (rs429358) and C____904973_10 for Arg158Cys (rs7412)] (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All samples were run in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each genotyping mixture consisted of 2.5 ml GTXpress master mix, 0.125 ml assay mix (40), and 1.375 ml distilled water mixed with 1 ml genomic DNA (10 ng/ml) in each reaction. One or two negative controls were included on each run. Based on the observed prevalence of the 4-allele in controls, the Japanese cohort's sample size had a 95% power to detect a relative likelihood of 1.64 for being a centenarian between 4-allele non-carriers and carriers with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (two-tailed). 

2.2.2 Italian cohort 

3. Results 

ApoE genotyping was performed on venous blood samples from all subjects (cases and controls) using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) as previously described by Hixson and Vernier (Hixson and Vernier, 1990). In brief, a 244-bp ApoE fragment was amplified by PCR (35 cycles; 95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min) with the primer pairs: 5'-GATCAAGCTTCCAATCACAGGCAGGAAG-3' and 5'-GATCCGGCCGCACACGTCCTCCATG-3'. The amplified fragment was digested using HhaI (Promega, Madison, WI), and the products were visualized on polyacrylamide gels. Each genotype gives a specific combination of HhaI fragment sizes, i.e., 2/2: 91 and 83 bp; 3/3: 91 and 48 bp; 4/4: 72 and 48 bp, and a mixed genotype; 2/3: 91, 83, and 48 bp; 3/4: 91, 72, and 48 bp; 2/4: 91, 83, 72, and 48 bp. 

3.1 Spanish cohort 

The failure rate of genotyping was 6.9% in cases and 3.9% in controls. The distribution of ApoE genotypes was consistent with the HWE in both groups (cases, P = 0.918; controls, P = 0.910). The results of genotype/allele frequency distributions as well as binary logistic regression are shown in Table 1 and summarized below. The frequency of the 2 or 3-allele did not differ between cases and controls (P >0.05). The frequency of the 4-allele was lower in Spanish cases than in controls (P =0.027), but no difference was found for the 4/4 genotype (P =0.608). The 4-allele was negatively associated with EL [odds ratio (OR) adjusted by sex =0.55 (95%CI:0.33-0.94), P =0.030]. Table 2 shows the results of the subgroup analyses within the centenarians' group, with no significant P-value having been found. 

2.2.3 Japanese cohort 

The failure rate of genotyping was 1.75% in cases and 0.20% in controls. The distribution of ApoE genotypes met HWE in both groups (cases, P =0.513; controls, P =0.056). The results of genotype/allele frequency distributions as well as binary logistic regression are shown in Table 3 and summarized below. The frequency of the 3-allele did not differ between cases and controls (P >0.05). The frequency of the 4-allele was lower in cases than in controls (P =0.046), whereas the frequency of the 2-allele was higher in the former (P =0.013). The 4-allele was negatively associated with healthy EL [OR adjusted by sex=0.41 (95%CI:0.18-0.99), P =0.05], whereas a positive associationThe distribution of ApoE genotypes was consistent with HWE in both groups (cases, P = 0.111; controls, P = 0.293). Table 5 shows the results of genotype/allele frequency distributions as well as binary logistic regression, which are summarized below. The frequency of 2/3 and 3/3 genotypes was higher in cases than in controls (P < 0.01), whereas the frequency of 3/4 and 4/4 genotypes was lower in cases. 

Table 3 shows the genotype/allele distributions of the ApoE gene and results of binary logistic regression in the Italian cohort. Significant P-values and associations are in bold. The results indicate that the 4-allele was negatively associated with the likelihood of becoming a centenarian in all three cohorts. A novel finding of this study was that the 2-allele seems to specifically favor EL in the Italian and Japanese population, although this result was not corroborated in the Spanish cohort. Of note, the 2-allele might also specifically favor successful or healthy EL in the Italian cohort studied. This allele was more frequent in Italian centenarians who were free of dementia or any other major age-related condition compared with their young controls, and was also more frequent in the oldest Italian centenarians than in the rest of this group.

Table 4 shows subgroup comparisons of genotype/allele distributions of the ApoE gene and results of binary logistic regression in Italian centenarians. Significant P-values and associations are in bold. The results indicate that the 4-allele is negatively associated with EL, a finding which was corroborated in all three independent cohorts.

There are large differences in ApoE allele frequencies among geographical areas and populations, e.g., with high relative frequencies of ApoE4 in Northern Europe (15-21%), intermediate frequencies in Central Europe (11-13%), and low frequencies in Southern Europe (4-6%). The 4-allele frequency in the Spanish (10%) and Italian (8%) young controls was relatively higher than that previously reported by Lewis and Brunner (2004) in Southern Europe. Whereas, the ApoE 4-allele frequency in Spanish and Italian centenarians was 4.9% and 3.2% respectively, which is within the range of previously published frequencies (1-10%) for European centenarians.

Table 5 shows the genotype/allele distributions of the ApoE gene and results of binary logistic regression in the Japanese cohort. Significant P-values and associations are in bold. The results indicate that the 4-allele was negatively associated with EL in all three cohorts. 

Table 6 shows subgroup comparisons of genotype/allele distributions of the ApoE gene and results of binary logistic regression in Japanese centenarians. There were no significant P-values or associations found.

Several biological mechanisms postulate ApoE, particularly the 4-allele, as a candidate to influence longevity. The view that ApoE is more of a frailty or disease-risk gene than a longevity gene has been debated, with its effects on death theoretically decreasing at very old ages. However, our results seem to support previous data on Scandinavian twins showing an increasing mortality risk associated with the ApoE 4-allele with advancing age or those showing lower frequency of this allele in centenarians compared with younger controls of various ethnicities. Our data seem to be in agreement with another hypothesis, the multifactorial threshold model, according to which many single factors each with a small yet significant effect add up and contribute to a disorder/condition (or death) to happen with age.The text appears to be a mix of statistical data and scientific research on the association between ApoE polymorphisms and age-related conditions like CVD and AD. The writer has used some abbreviations like 95% CI for 95% confidence interval and OR for odds ratio. There are also some grammatical errors and typos that need to be corrected. Here's the processed text:

Abbreviations: 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; OR, odds ratio (adjusted for sex). The 4-allele is a well-established risk factor for age-related conditions, mainly CVD and AD. A meta-analysis of 121 studies showed that this allele is associated with higher CVD risk, coupled with higher plasma cholesterol levels (Bennet et al., 2007). The association with CVD may be due to higher LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the plasma of 4-carriers (Dallongeville et al., 1992). A recent meta-analysis of 21 studies on ApoE polymorphisms and AD concluded that the 4-allele is strongly associated with a significantly higher risk of sporadic late-onset AD (Sadigh-Eteghad et al., 2012). ApoE-lipoproteins bind to several cell-surface receptors to deliver lipids and also to hydrophobic amyloid-(A) peptide, which is thought to initiate toxic events that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD (Liu et al., 2013). ApoE isoforms differentially regulate A aggregation and clearance in the brain and have important functions in regulating brain lipid transport, glucose metabolism, neuronal signaling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function (Liu et al., 2013), with the 4-allele being associated with higher A cellular uptake, leading to more A aggregation compared to 3 (Liu et al., 2013; Smith 2002; Verghese et al., 2013). The aggregation of A is linked to the loss of dendritic spines and accelerating memory impairments in AD (Hashimoto et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2010). A recent study showed that the levels of A oligomers in AD patients were lowest in those carrying the 2-allele (Hashimoto et al., 2012). The 2-allele also seems to play a protective role against CVD (Bennet et al., 2007; Gerdes et al., 2000; Kolovou et al., 2002), although the evidence is probably weaker than for the negative effect of the 4-allele (Drenos and Kirkwood, 2010). In addition, previous large population-based longitudinal studies, i.e., the Rotterdam study (Slooter et al., 2001) and the Danish 1905 birth cohort (Lindahl-Jacobsen et al., 2013), reported no favorable effect of the 2-allele on mortality in the elderly, despite protecting against cognitive decline in the oldest old (93 years) (Lindahl-Jacobsen et al., 2013).

Besides the rationale for postulating ApoE as a candidate to influence EL, a major strength of our study was the clear definition we used for the criterion of EL (with all cases being centenarians). A novelty with regards to previous research on EL and ApoE stems from the fact that (i) the analyses were conducted in three independent cohorts (with one of them, the Japanese cohort, including a very large sample of centenarians) and(ii) we studied both normal and super-healthy (Italian) centenarians. Nonetheless, it must be kept in mind that the cross-sectional nature of our design precludes comments on causality, and we only concentrated on EL as a categorical trait (i.e., to be centenarian or not) rather than on the continuous life-span, which runs the risk of losing some information. On the other hand, some caution is needed when attempting to extrapolate our findings to the whole Italian, Spanish or Japanese population because we used mostly convenience samples, which raises the risk of bias due to population stratification. Another limitation of our study is the relatively high rate of genotyping failure in the Spanish cohort, particularly in cases. The main reason might lie in the fact that DNA extraction from saliva in frail individuals such as centenarians might result in small amounts of DNA available for analyses (we did not collect blood samples based on ethical constraints). Thus, blood sampling is likely preferable in this population segment. Also, two different methodologies were used in the Spanish cohort, i.e., TaqMan and real-time PCR. With regard to the two aforementioned limitations, we believe the fact that genotype distributions met HWE in the two Spanish groups (cases and controls) and allele/genotype frequencies were similarI cannot see any text enclosed in ``` ```.

In summary, our data corroborate that ApoE genotypes are associated with exceptional longevity (EL). The 4-allele appears to decrease the likelihood of reaching EL among individuals of different ethnic/geographic backgrounds. An additional finding of our report was that the 2-allele seems to favor EL in the Italians and Japanese cohorts we studied. Moreover, the 2-allele appears to specifically favor healthy EL in the Italian cohort we assessed although this finding remains to be corroborated in other cohorts of disease-free centenarians from the same country and other parts of the world and especially in longitudinal studies.
