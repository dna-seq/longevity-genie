preparations administered to individual patients by the amount of IVIG each patient received during the 5 days resulted in a mean of 15·71 mg total (active and latent) TGF(cid:2) (52% TGF(cid:2)1, 48% TGF(cid:2)2) received by the patients during the course of therapy.

We can now report that the powerful immunosuppressive cytokine TGF(cid:2) is present in substantial amounts in commercially available IVIG preparations. Since immunoglobulin has been described as a carrier of TGF(cid:2),4 the high concentrations of TGF(cid:2) in IVIG may initially be delivered by IVIG, namely by the immunoglobulin-bound cytokine. Because our experiments disclosed no adherence of TGF(cid:2) to IgG, the methods for the manufacture and long- term storage of IVIG may facilitate the dissociation of TGF(cid:2) non-specifically bound to IgG. The inference that TGF(cid:2) contributes to the therapeutic effects of IVIG therapy is supported by the results of various animal studies on autoimmune diseases,5 in which the administration of TGF(cid:2) led to increased immunosuppression similar to that seen under IVIG therapy. Although TGF(cid:2)-containing IVIG preparations may be useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, their value in the treatment of other disorders is unknown. It remains for future clinical trials to compare the effects of IVIG preparations with and without TGF(cid:2) or to apply TGF(cid:2) alone in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases.

diseases—and thereby life span of the individual. examine this hypothesis, we analysed mtDNA from Japanese centenarians.

The entire coding regions of mtDNA, including two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 13 protein-coding genes, from 11 centenarians were sequenced by fluorescence- based automated direct sequencing.3 Although there were a variety of nucleotide substitutions, we identified several that were more frequent among these centenarians than among the 43 controls whose mtDNA sequences had been analysed.4 Two nucleotide substitutions causing aminoacid replacements (a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide position [np] 5178 within the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene [ND2], causing Leu-to-Met replacement; and a C-to-T transition at np 8414 within the ATP synthase subunit 8 gene [ATP8], causing Leu-to-Phe replacement) as well as a G-to-A transition at np 3010 within the 16S rRNA gene, were more frequently observed in the centenarians than in the controls (Mt5178A in 9/11 centenarians vs 12/43 controls, p<0·01; Mt8414T in 7/11 centenarians vs 11/43 controls, p<0·05; and Mt3010A in 7/11 centenarians vs 11/42 controls, p<0·05). Most of these variations were linked; all of the seven centenarians with both Mt8414T and Mt3010A carried Mt5178A.

Among these variations, we focused on Mt5178A and screened 37 centenarians and 252 healthy blood donors in Aichi Prefecture for the presence of Mt5178A by PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) with AluI. The frequency of Mt5178A was significantly higher in centenarians (23/37, 62%) than in blood donors (114/252, 45% p=0·04, odds ratio 1·99). This finding suggests that Mt5178A is related to longevity.

Mitochondrial genotype associated with longevity

To evaluate the effect of mtDNA variations on the occurrence of diseases, we analysed the frequencies of Mt5178A and Mt5178C in 338 randomly selected inpatients and outpatients at Nagoya University Hospital. The age distribution of the patients with Mt5178A or Mt5178C (figure) indicated that the frequency of Mt5178C was almost the same as that of Mt5178A among the young patients (Mt5178 A:C ratio 46:40 for patients aged <46), whereas the frequency of Mt5178C increased more markedly than that of Mt5178A among old patients (Mt5178 A:C ratio 86:166 for patients aged (cid:5)46) with a clear reflection point at age 45. The ratio of Mt5178 A/C was significantly lower in the old patients (Mt5178 ratio 86:166) than in both the centenarians (23:14, p=0·001) and the healthy controls (114:138, p=0·01). This result suggests that the individuals with Mt5178C are more susceptible to adult-onset diseases than those with Mt5178A.

Mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, cardiomyopathies, and diabetes mellitus. It has been proposed that accumulation of mtDNA mutations in somatic cells contributes to ageing and to degenerative diseases.1 Sequence diversity of mtDNA is marked between individuals, because the evolutionary rate of mtDNA is 5–10 times higher than that of nuclear DNA. An epidemiological study on coronary heart disease has indicated that longevity is more strongly associated with age of maternal than age of paternal death.2 It may be that maternally transmitted mitochondrial genotypes influence oxidative damage to mtDNA, the accumulation rate of mtDNA mutations, and susceptibility to degenerative

Cann et al reported, in their study on human evolution,5 that among 147 samples from the world, only five Asians and one European carried Mt5178A. This observation indicates that Mt5178A is relatively rare among the global population. The high frequency of Mt5178A among the Japanese population (45%) may be relevant to the fact that the life expectancy at birth in Japan is among the highest on Earth. Life expectancy for females is 83·59 years, while for males it is 77·01 years.

Our findings support the concept that to carry an mtDNA genotype predisposing resistance to adult-onset diseases is one of the genetic factors for longevity. Further studies are needed to clarify the functional differences between these mtDNA variations. It will also be interesting to identify those adult-onset diseases to which individuals with Mt5178C are susceptible.

experiments with ethidium bromide were used to determine if imipenem resistance was plasmid-mediated. Susceptibility tests and IEF were carried out on cured colonies.

Strain 1622 was resistant to all antibiotics tested, including imipenem (MIC 16 mg/L). The addition of enzyme inhibitors, including sulbactam which is usually intrinsically active against Acinetobacter spp did not reduce carbapenem MIC values. IEF detected the presence of a novel (cid:2)-lactamase designated ARI-2 (main band of pI 6.5). Enzyme activity was inhibited by clavulanate and BRL 42715 but not edetic acid (shown by IEF inhibitor overlays), indicating that ARI-2 was a class A (cid:2)-lactamase rather than a metallo-enzyme (figure). Strain 1622 inactivated imipenem as decteted by the microbiological assay. Slow imipenem hydrolysis was calculated by the modified microbiological assay (0·75 nmol min(cid:6)1 mL(cid:6)1). After plasmid curing, the ARI-2 enzyme was lost from strain 1622, detected by IEF. There was also more than a tenfold decrease in the rate of imipenem hydrolysis (0·067 nmol min(cid:6)1 mL(cid:6)1), as well as a reduction in carbapenem MIC values to susceptible levels, which strongly linked ARI-2 with plasmid-encoded carbapenemase activity.

Limitation of Acinetobacter baumannii treatment by plasmid- mediated carbapenemase ARI-2

Acinetobacter species now account for 10% of nosocomial infections in intensive therapy units (ITU) in Europe. They are invariably multiresistant, and one major concern is the increasing incidence of carbapenem-resistant isolates, since these antibiotics are frequently the therapeutic choice for these infections. Carbapenem resistance in South America has already reached levels that significantly influence therapeutic choices (Carlos Bantar, unpublished data), and this looks set to be a problem in some European countries.1 ARI-1, a plasmid-mediated enzyme capable of hydrolysing imipenem, was the first carbapenemase to be isolated from this genus.2 We report a novel plasmid-mediated carbapenemase (ARI-2) from a multiresistant clinical isolate of A baumannii from Argentina (first described in 1996).3

These results, and the increasing incidence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp, highlight how the role of these antibiotics in the treatment of ITU infections is severely threatened. Our preliminary investigations have also demonstrated the presence of ARI-2 in a number of clinical isolates of Acinetobacter (including A junii) (unpublished), from Europe and south-east Asia. This carbapenemase looks set to become a major worldwide resistance problem which, along with the recent report of a meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolate with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin,5 is an indication of the alarming ability of modern pathogens to become totally resistant in response to the introduction of therapeutic strategies. The emphasis must now be on finding alternative antibiotic therapies.

The strain (1622) was isolated from a bronchial alveolar lavage specimen and identification was carried out by the API 20NE identification system. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a range of antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution method.4 A cell-free extract of strain 1622 was prepared and (cid:2)-lactamase bands were detected by isoelectric focusing (IEF) on a polyacrylamide gel. Inhibitors were applied to the gel to detect enzyme inhibition. Imipenem hydrolysis was demonstrated by a microbiological assay.2 This assay was modified to increase sensitivity and quantify the activity of the enzyme.3 Curing
