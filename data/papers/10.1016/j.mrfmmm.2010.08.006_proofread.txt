genes for association with the longevity phenotype in a German sample comprising approximately 400 centenarians and an equal number of younger control subjects. This study is one of the largest candidate studies in human genetic longevity research to date. The study investigated genes involved in longevity pathways, such as insulin receptor/insulin-like growth factor-I signaling and energy metabolism, intracellular signaling, apoptosis, and stress response. Additionally, the study looked at genes in which mutations lead to genetic perturbations in animal models or human diseases. The top-ranking markers located in the genes DUSP6, NALP1, and PERP revealed p-values below 0.01 in allelic case-control comparisons. The association signals in Germans were not replicated in an independent French sample; however, the large number of analysis results is deemed a valuable reference point for further genetic studies.

Longevity in humans is considered a multifactorial trait to which both genetic and environmental factors contribute. Epidemiological studies have shown that the modulation of aging processes is inherited in long-lived families, and genetic factors have been estimated to account for about 25-32% of the variation in human adult lifespan. A twin study has revealed that genetic influences on survival are minimal before the age of 60 but increase thereafter. It is still debated to what extent a long and healthy life is based on the absence of harmful genetic variants that result in age-related disorders and/or on the presence of polymorphisms with beneficial effects in so-called longevity-enabling genes.

There is mounting evidence from experimental model organisms (S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus) for the existence of core survival/anti-aging pathways that influence the aging process by increasing an organism's capacity to cope with stress-induced molecular damage and thus represent key candidates for attaining longevity. On the other hand, disruptions in these pathways lead to age-related failure of cellular maintenance and function, reduced stress tolerance, diseases, and ultimately death. Mutations in single genes involved in the pathways can either delay or accelerate the aging process in diverse model organisms. Many of the survival genes and pathways are evolutionarily conserved and also present in H. sapiens, thus providing a rationale to search for corresponding human loci. However, longevity candidate studies in humans are often hampered by difficulties replicating results in independent population samples. The most consistent association findings so far have been reported for the apolipoprotein E (APOE) and the forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A) genes.

The 500 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 343 candidate genes were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls before inclusion in the analyses (P HWE >0.01). The genomic control analysis was conducted using PLINK V1.01 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). Power and sample sizes were calculated with the PS Power and Sample Size Program (http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/PowerSampleSize), applying a significance level of 0.05. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the two different dominant/recessive models (first allele dominant or second allele dominant) and an additive effects model on the logistic scale (multiplicativity of the odds ratios [OR]). In an additional analysis, APOE was included in the regression to adjust for its effect on longevity. The number of four alleles was taken into account for APOE, and an additive allelic effect on the logistic scale was assumed for the three candidate genes. Possible interactions were investigated. For the adjustment of multiple testing, the classical Bonferroni method and the false discovery rate of Benjamini et al. were applied. The regression analysis and the adjustment for multiple testing were performed with the statistics software program R (version 2.5.1). A p-value smaller than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Recently, exonuclease 1 (EXO1) was identified as a candidate for a novel longevity-enabling gene in a targeted approach by analyzing 92 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in 49 DNA repair genes. Nonsynonymous SNPs result in amino acid changes and are likely to affect the structure and function of the produced protein. Together with SNPs in regulatory regions, they are supposed to have the highest impact on the phenotype. In the present study, the same targeted nsSNP approach was applied for the investigation of additional longevity pathways (IIS and energy metabolism, intracellular signaling, apoptosis, and stress response) and genes in which mutations lead to genetic perturbations in animal models or human diseases. Altogether, 500 nsSNPs in 343 candidate genes were tested.Genes for association with the longevity phenotype in a German sample comprising about 400 centenarians and an equal number of younger control subjects were investigated. 

2. Material and methods 

In this investigation, 386 German centenarians (100-110 years) were compared to 410 appropriately matched younger controls (60-75 years) using an established longevity study design [31]. In 343 candidate genes, we typed 500 nsSNPs that represent a subset of a large panel described in detail elsewhere [34]. Gender- and region-matched case-control analyses were performed at the allele (CCA) and genotype (CCG) levels (Supplementary Table).

The genes of interest were derived from extensive literature research and from the Panther Classification System (http://panther.appliedbiosystems.com/navigation.jsp). They belong to longevity pathways (IIS and energy metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle control, stress response, and intracellular signaling) or are based on genetic perturbations in animal models and on human diseases. The investigated nsSNP-assays were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, USA) and represent a subset of a large panel of 19779 nsSNPs described elsewhere [34] (http://marketing.appliedbiosystems.com/mk/get/GAAS HUMAN SNPGENO#). Altogether, we investigated 500 nsSNPs in 343 candidate genes (Supplementary Table).

Genotyping of the German samples was performed with the SNPlexTM Genotyping System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) [35]. The typing in the French replication sample was carried out with TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems).

3. Results 

The three top-ranking markers with respect to P (rs770087, CCA rs2301582 and rs648802) were located in three different genes [the dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6, GenBank No. BC037236), the NACHT leucine-rich-repeat protein 1 (NALP1, GenBank No. AB023143) and the p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP22 (PERP, GenBank No. AF317550)] and each showed a P < 0.01 in the CCA entire sample (Table 1a). A subgroup analysis yielded similar p-values and frequency distributions for females (Table 1b). Because of the limited number of male centenarians (n=82), we did not perform a male-specific analysis. None of the significant P values CCA of the three SNPs remained significant when adjusted for multiple testing by the conservative Bonferroni method or the false discovery method (Tables 1a and 1b).

As the screening represented the explorative stage of this study and only served to identify markers for genetic replication, the three SNPs were subsequently genotyped in an independent French collection of 541 centenarians and 469 younger controls. However, the genetic association observed in Germans could not be confirmed in the French (Table 2), neither in the entire sample nor in the sex-specific analysis (data not shown). Also, the combined investigation of both Germans and French did not yield more significant values than for Germans alone (Table 3). The French study had a power of 50-80% to replicate the German findings (80% for rs770087 assuming an OR of 1.5 in Germans and 50% for rs2301582 and rs648802 each with an OR of 1.3 [Supplementary Fig. 1]). A sample size of about 1000 cases (with a case-control-ratio of 1) would be required to gain 80% power for the replication of SNP rs2301582 and rs648802 (Supplementary Fig. 2).

4. Discussion 

Previously, we have identified a polymorphism in the EXO1 gene as a likely modulator of human longevity in a targeted nsSNP approach [29]. Such an experiment is rapid and cost-efficient as it allows the direct evaluation of possible functional variants. Here, we applied the same strategy for the investigation of additional genes for association with longevity. 

In our analysis of the three candidate SNPs in the German and French samples, we also adjusted for APOE, the only gene shown to have a large effect (OR>2) on longevity [17,19], to reduce possible bias and confounding as well as to generate better estimates of the ORs. The results differed only negligibly from the non-adjusted ones (data not shown).

One of the largest centenarian collections to-date was used to investigate the potential role of genetic variants in human longevity by analyzing the functional genes involved in various longevity pathways using three of the tested nsSNPs that revealed a P value of less than or equal to 0.01, located in three different genes: DUSP6, NALP1, and PERP, all of which are involved in the induction of apoptosis and other diverse pathways linked to longevity or the aging process [41-43]. The DUSP6 protein negatively regulates members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which are associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation [44-46]. Additionally, down-regulation of DUSP6 protein expression enhances carcinogenesis [47-49]. Its function as a tumor-suppressor gene [48,50] renders DUSP6 a potential modifier of human longevity. Down-regulation of PERP, besides its role as a key mediator of programmed cell death [42], has also been linked to different types of cancer [52-54]. NALP1 plays an important role in the immune system [55,56] and DNA sequence variants in the NALP1 region were shown to be associated with the risk of several epidemiologically associated autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases [57]. Hence, DUSP6, NALP1, and PERP are very good candidates for influencing human health and, thus, longevity.

Genetic variants that are more frequent in the long-lived than in the control population (the T-allele of nsSNP rs2301582 [NALP1] and the G-allele of rs648802 [PERP]; Table 1) can be regarded as beneficial by enhancing tumor-suppressor activity (PERP) or strengthening the immune system (NALP1).
