Abstract

We studied centenarians to investigate the biological basis of human longevity focusing on the apolipoprotein A-IV and lipoprotein(a), which are potentially involved in the susceptibility to atherogenic mechanisms. We analyzed two restriction polymorphisms: % HinfI (alleles (cid:27), (cid:28)) and Fnu4HI (alleles 1, 2), and a VNTR (alleles 3, 4) at the 3' region of the apo A-IV gene. We compared the allele 347-360 frequencies, the lipoprotein concentrations and their association in centenarians and adults. In centenarians, the HinfI genotype distribution is different (P <0.05), and the ((cid:27)13) haplotype is prevalent (0.54 vs. 0.39), with a greater association of ((cid:27)3), indicating the selection of a favorable allele. The lipoprotein modulation by the apo A-IV polymorphisms is suggested by significant associations in adults (((cid:27):(cid:27)) homozygotes have lower LDL-cholesterol and apo B than heterozygotes; (1:1) homozygotes have higher TG and apo B than heterozygotes), which in centenarians still exists as a trend. 

Centenarians show peculiar lipoprotein features: lower LDL-cholesterol (mean 103 vs. 115 mg/dl; P <0.02) and higher lipoprotein(a) (median 17.5 vs. 4.5; P <0.002). A large part of them (47%), especially the Hinf((cid:27):(cid:27)) and the ((cid:27)13) homozygotes, have a lipoprotein(a) <20 mg/dl, a value considered as the threshold for atherogenic risk, surprisingly compatible with healthy longevity.

1. Introduction

Longevity is probably the result of a lucky interaction of non-genetic and genetic factors. Some genes can cause or predispose to age-related disorders. Different alleles of these genes or different genes, in association or per se, are possibly involved in longevity, each having a small effect: the right combination of allele variants can result in the protection against severe diseases or promotion of survival. Thus, successful aging would be characterized by a low frequency of risk alleles and the selective enrichment of favorable genotypes.

Human aging is generally described as a biological decline associated with damage to DNA, cells, tissues, and organs [1]. However, at present, aging is considered rather as a physiological remolding of biological functions. 

In this respect, few loci have been examined so far. Significant longevity-associations of HLA, apolipoprotein E, CIII, B, and angiotensin-converting enzyme coding regions [21,24,25]. The size polymorphism, due to the inter-individual variable number of the so-called kringle4 domain (K4), is considered the major factor responsible for the high variation in the plasma Lp(a) concentration, ranging from 0.1 to 100 mg/dl. This feature is thought to be scantily influenced by age, sex, menopausal status, diet or lifestyle [26,27], and is considered as an essentially genetic trait inversely related to the K4 repeat number [24,28]. Although the physiological and/or pathological roles of Lp(a) are still unresolved, high plasma concentrations are associated, at least in Caucasians, with an increased risk of CAD and CVD, both independently and in correlation with other genetic determinants including the apo A-IV polymorphism [29]. A value of 20 mg/dlText processed:

Lipoprotein concentrations were measured in centenarians and controls. The Friedewald formula [32] was used for calculating LDL-C. Nephelometry was used to measure serum apolipoprotein B and A-I levels. Lp(a) plasma concentrations were determined using the Immunozym Lp(a) Kit (Immuno-Vienna) by ELISA in duplicate. Samples were stored at -80C for a maximum of 1 month and thawed only once at the time of quantitation to avoid a significant effect of storage on the results [33]. 

The x2 test was used to compare allele frequencies in centenarians and controls estimated by gene counting. The linkage disequilibrium D for the pairs of loci was estimated by the methods of Nei [37]. Lipoprotein concentrations in the two groups were compared by the unpaired Students t test and U MannWhitney test (the latter employed for Lp(a), due to its non-Gaussian distribution). The association of the different apo A-IV polymorphisms with plasma lipoprotein levels was analyzed using the unpaired Students t test, the U MannWhitney test when comparing two groups, and one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA for comparison of three groups. The SPSS package was used for statistical analysis.

DNA was extracted from 500 l of peripheral blood in 0.1M EDTA pH 7.5 [34]. PCR amplifications were performed using 500 ng of DNA, 12.5 pmol of primers, and 200 M dNTPs. The gene region containing the two polymorphic sites at codons 347 and 360 was analyzed for the amplified fragment length polymorphism (Amp-FLP). The fragment of 244 bp was amplified using the primers A1 and A2. The product was digested by HinfI or by Fnu4HI restriction enzyme and each polymorphic pattern was analyzed on a suitable % selective gel. The 3 untranslated portion of the gene containing the VNTR was separately amplified with primers A3: nt.2414 5 GATGCTGGCCCCTTTGG- AGAG and primer A4: nt.2634 5GCTGCAAGGA- GGATTCATCCG (the positions are according to [10]). PCR conditions were 1 at 94C, 1 at 62C, and 1 at 72C, for 30 cycles. The product was directly analyzed by selective gel electrophoresis. Samples with different migrations were sequenced (USB Sequenase 2.0 version) to control the actual dimension of the repeat. Whenever required, the cis:trans location of the three polymorphisms was determined by the double HinfxFnu digestion of the 244 bp fragment or by the Hinf digestion of the 472 bp fragment amplified using the primers A1 A4 (same conditions as for the primers A3A4).

The apo A-IV polymorphism was analyzed by genotyping. The Thr Ser change that eliminates a HinfI site was identified by the presence (allele') or absence (allele'') of the restriction site in the 244 bp amplified fragment. The Gln H His 360 change that results in the loss of a Fnu4HI site was separately identified by the presence (allele 1) or absence (allele 2) of this cutting site in the same amplification product. The VNTR alleles were identified by direct gel electrophoresis of the specific amplified fragment.

Isoforms of apo(a) were analyzed using a gradient SDS-PAGE and western blotting on nitrocellulose.

The genotype distribution was compared in our study groups, and the frequencies were tested for significance by the x2 test. The haplotypes found in the two study groups, their frequencies, and the linkage disequilibrium D analysis for the pair of HinfVNTR loci were summarized in Table 2.

Plasma concentrations of lipids, apolipoproteins, and lipoproteins were analyzed in centenarians and adults. We found significant differences in LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, B:L, and Lp(a) concentrations between the two groups. The VNTR itself did not appear to be significantly associated with any of the lipoprotein plasma concentrations in either group. We searched for a possible association between the three apo A-IV polymorphisms considered together in the haplotype phase and lipoprotein concentrations. In centenarians, going from the ((cid:27)14) homozygotes to the ((cid:27)13:(cid:27)14) heterozygotes and then to the ((cid:27)13) homozygotes some trends were observed, in particular, Lpprocedure used allowed for the identification of isoproteins into major categories, which was considered satisfactory for a preliminary investigation (Fig. 3). No subjects with the F type were found. The S2 and S3 isoforms were the most frequent and prevalent in subjects with Lp(a) levels below 25 mg/dl, while the larger S4 isoform was most represented in subjects with Lp(a) levels below this value. S2 and S3 characterized respectively the 50 Apo A-IV haplotypes ((cid:27)13), ((cid:27)14), ((cid:28)14), ((cid:28)13), ((cid:27)23), ((cid:27)24), ((cid:28)23), and ((cid:28)24). Centenarians had allele No. 61 (54%), 34 (30%), 10 (9%), 2 (2%), 3 (3%), 2 (2%), 0, and 0 for the respective haplotypes. Adults had allele No. 67 (39%), 67 (39%), 19 (11%), 10 (6%), 6 (3%), 3 (2%), 0, and 0 for the respective haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium values (D) for pairs of polymorphic sites at Hinf and VNTR loci were analyzed, revealing significantly different D values in centenarians compared to adults. The results suggest that some apo A-IV polymorphic variants, namely Hinf((cid:27)) and VNTR(3), are enriched with aging, and the ((cid:27):(cid:27)) and ((cid:27)13) alleles are somehow selected in long-lived people, possibly because they are of long-term benefit and favor longevity.

In Table 6, serum lipoprotein concentrations with respect to genotype in centenarians are shown. The major findings concern the LDL-C and Lp(a) concentrations. The mean concentration of LDL-C in centenarians is low, very close to that considered as the optimal cut-off level in CAD secondary prevention, 100 mg/dl. This probably makes it one of the major factors which confer protection against this disease in such individuals, thus representing a possible selective feature for longevity. The Lp(a) concentration is unexpectedly high in centenarians, revealing to be mostly unaffected by other factors such as drugs, smoking, alcohol, etc. The increased value, in the absence of chronic or acute-phase diseases, can derive from a general remolding of the plasma parameters with aging or is genetically determined by apo(a). Thus, the data on Lp(a) in centenarians draw an unusual pattern since a so-called atherogenic marker does not preclude longevity.

The potential impact of the apo A-IV polymorphism on lipid and lipoprotein plasma concentrations was analyzed.Homozygotes with the (1:1) allele have lower LDL-C and apo B concentrations than the (1:2) heterozygotes, which differs from the observation that the (1:2) allele reduces the levels of these parameters [16]. On the other hand, homozygotes with the (1:1) allele exhibit higher TG and apo B values than the (1:2) heterozygotes, consistent with other studies [18,19]. Our findings support the modulating function of apo A-IV alleles on plasma lipoproteins in adults. However, discrepancies with other reports could be due to variations in sex ratio, age range, and diet responsiveness of different populations studied. In centenarians, although these associations presumably confer an advantage, they are not statistically significant, probably due to an attenuation of the allele-modulating effect with aging. For example, the HinfI polymorphism is significantly associated with Lp(a) concentration in centenarians, where homozygotes with ((cid:27):(cid:27)) have a higher value than heterozygotes with ((cid:27):(cid:28)). This is consistent with the high incidence of ((cid:27):(cid:27)) genotype in this group. VNTR does not appear to be significantly related to lipoprotein parameters. However, some gradient concentrations (i.e. LDL-C and TG) can be observed. In particular, an association between (3:3) and ((cid:27)13) genotypes and increased Lp(a) medians can be seen in centenarians, where these genotypes are most frequent. According to the proposed role of apo A-IV [13], modulation of LPL activity could affect LDL-C levels. Modulation of reverse cholesterol transport and LCAT activity could affect HDL-C levels. Changes in either amino acid 347 or 360 of the protein sequence and deduced structure [11,12] could modify the domain where they are located. Allele variants of these loci could act on these mechanisms and influence the physiological functions of the molecule, presumably with a different impact on each lipoprotein class. For example, we found an inverse relationship between LDL-C and apo B with the two loci in adults and centenarians, leading to balanced lipoprotein levels. VNTR, located in the non-coding apo A-IV region, probably has no direct effect when considered alone. The higher Lp(a) concentrations observed in centenarians are possibly due to the great association with the ((cid:27)) variant at the HinfI locus, which is significantly associated with this parameter. It is difficult at present to explain a functional interaction between two apparently unrelated genes such as apo A-IV and apo(a). However, each of these genes could be involved in the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. In conclusion, our analysis of genetic and biochemical parameters has revealed new longevity-associated features. The high frequency of HinfI((cid:27):(cid:27)) polymorphism of apo A-IV, low levels of LDL-C, and especially high Lp(a) concentration found in centenarians add further elements to the biological longevity pattern. We suggest that a combination of genetic factors such as apo A-IV alleles with their possible impact on circulating lipoproteins, Lp(a) concentration and perhaps apo(a) isoforms together with non-genetic factors characterize some individuals in a population conferring a biological advantage that selects them for long and healthy survival. Centenarians represent a unique model to inspect on the basis of longevity. The availability of another homogeneous group for study has offered our group an important opportunity to gain better insight into biological processes of aging.
