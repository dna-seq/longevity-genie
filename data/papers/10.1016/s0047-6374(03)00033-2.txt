Abstract

In this study, we analysed the polymorphic variants of IL-1a (C(cid:1)T transition at position (cid:2)889), IL-1b (C(cid:1)T transition at / / / position (cid:2)511) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (Ra) (86-bp repeated sequence in intron 2) in 1131 subjects (453 females and 678 males) / from Northern and Central Italy, including 134 centenarians, to evaluate whether IL-1 cluster alleles might be differently represented in people selected for longevity. In addition, IL-1Ra and IL-1b plasma levels were quantified by ELISA in 130 randomly selected subjects. No significant differences in the genotype and allele frequency distributions were observed between young, elderly and centenarian subjects. IL-1Ra plasma levels showed an age-related increase, whereas IL-1b plasma levels did not show any detectable age-related trend. Neither IL-1Ra nor IL-1b plasma levels showed any relationship with genotypes of the three IL-1 genes. These results suggest that no one particular polymorphism in the IL-1 gene cluster yields an advantage for survival in the last decades of life, and that the age-related increase in plasma levels of IL-1Ra seems not to be genetically regulated but a likely safeguard mechanism to buffer the age-associated increased inflammatory state. # 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction

Proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines are be- lieved to play a pathogenetic role in age-related diseases. In several cytokine genes, polymorphisms affecting gene transcription and causing interindividual variations in cytokine production have been described (Bidwell et al., 1999, 2001). In this regard, it has been proposed that genetic variation in pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines is capable of modulating the susceptibility to age-related diseases (Keen et al., 1998; Francis et al., 1999; Licastro et al., 2000).

Aging is associated with chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation (Franceschi et al., 2000; Bruunsgaard et al., 2001). Inflammatory markers are the predictors of disability and mortality in the elderly (Ferrucci et al., 1999; Harris et al., 1999; Brod, 2000). Indeed, age- related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, athero- sclerosis, type 2 diabetes as well as age-related disorders such as sarcopenia and osteoporosis are caused or worsened by systemic inflammation.

Recently, genetic variations in pro- or anti-inflamma- tory cytokines have been shown to affect successful aging and longevity. Indeed, the (cid:3)874T IFN-g allele / involved in high production of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-g was found less frequently in centenarian

women than in control women (Lio et al., 2002a). Additionally, the proportion of subjects homozygous for the G allele at (cid:2)174 of the IL-6 locus (characterised / by high serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6) was significantly decreased in centenarian men (Bonafe` et al., 2001). In contrast, the presence of the  / 1082GG genotype associated with high production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased in centenarian men in comparison with younger ones (Lio et al., 2002b). On the whole, these results suggest that the genetic control of the inflamma- tory status and in particular its substantial interaction with gender plays an important role in longevity.

2.2. Genotyping

DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes by phenol chloroform according to standard procedures

The IL-1 gene cluster is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q13) and contains genes for IL-1a, IL- 1b and IL-1 receptor antagonist (Ra) within a region of 430 kb (Nicklin et al., 1994; Cox et al., 1998; Rosen- wasser, 1998). The agonists, IL-1a and IL-1b, are believed to exert identical actions via binding to a single cell surface receptor (IL-1RI) involved in signal trans- duction. The third member of the IL-1 family, IL-1Ra, is a highly selective, competitive receptor antagonist that binds to IL-1RI, but fails to trigger signal transduction. A number of biallelic and multiallelic markers in the region surrounding the IL-1 genes have been identified and several reports have provided evidence that these polymorphisms play a pathophysiological role by influ- encing the susceptibility to and the severity of a variety of disorders, including age-related diseases (Clay et al., 1994; Crusius et al., 1995; Heresbach et al., 1997; Hurme et al., 1998; Fang et al., 1999; Nemetz et al., 1999; Grimaldi et al., 2000; Iacoviello et al., 2000; Langdahl et

Polymerase chain reactions were performed as lows:

The two alleles were revealed by electrophoretic analysis in a 2% agarose gel. IL-1b. The C(cid:1)T transition at position (cid:2)511 in the 5? / / flanking region was amplified according to di Giovine et al. (1992), by using primers 5?-TGGCATT- GATCTGGTTCATC-3? and 5?-GTTTAGGAAT- CTTCCCACTT-3?.

The 304 bp amplified fragment was digested with AvaI enzyme (New England Biolabs). The presence of the restriction site leads to two bands of 190 and 114 bp. The two alleles were revealed by electro- phoretic analysis in a 2% agarose gel.

We therefore analysed IL-1a ((cid:2)889 C0T), IL-1b ((cid:2) / / / 511 C0T) and IL-1Ra (86-bp repeated sequences in / intron 2) in 1131 people (453 females and 678 males) from Northern and Central Italy, including 134 cente- narians, to evaluate whether these polymorphisms in the IL-1 cluster might be differently represented in people selected for longevity. To gain insight into IL-1 cluster regulation, IL-1b and IL-1Ra plasma levels were also assayed in a randomly selected sample of these subjects.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Subjects

1131 unrelated individuals (453 females and 678 males) born and resident in Northern and Central Italy, ranging from 20 to 102 years, were enrolled for the study. The sample included 134 centenarians (94 females and 40 males). For centenarians, age was verified by researching archival records in the City Hall and/or Church registries, paying attention to the concordance between reported age and personal chronologies (age of

Plasma samples were available from 130 subjects (71 females and 59 males) and were frozen at (cid:2)70 8C until / the assay. IL-1Ra plasma levels were quantified with IL- 1Ra ELISA kits (Quantikine, R&D Systems, Minnea- polis, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc- tions. The detection limit was 14 pg/ml. IL-1b plasma levels were quantified by human IL-1b-specific ELISA

kits (Biosource International, Inc., Camarillo, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The detec- tion limit was 0.12 pg/ml.

related increase. When the analysis was performed separately in each gender, the regression analysis showed a significant increase in the age range from 60 to 100 both in women and men. In the same group of 130 unrelated individuals, the IL-1b plasma levels were assessed. In 27 subjects, the IL-1b plasma levels were below the sensitivity of the assay (less than 0.12 pg/ml), thus only 103 subjects (64 females and 39 males) had detectable IL-1b levels. IL-1b plasma levels did not show any detectable age-related trend (P(cid:5)0.796). No / detectable age-related trend was found when the analy- sis was performed separately in each gender.

2.4. Statistical analysis

Allele and genotype frequency distributions were compared by Monte-Carlo x2 implemented in Statistical Product and Service Solution Package (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Hardy(cid:1)Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was checked / by Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (Guo and Thompson, 1992). Since IL-1b and IL-1Ra plasma levels were not normally distributed, values were ln-transformed (Fer- rucci et al., 1999). Linear regression was employed to assess the age effects on plasma levels. General linear model (implemented in SPSS Package) was employed to test the age-adjusted effects of genetic factors on cytokine production.

Alleles and genotypes of three polymorphic sites at IL-1 cluster were estimated in the group of people described above. Neither IL-1b nor IL-1Ra plasma levels showed any relationship with genotypes at the IL-1b locus (F(cid:5)0.448, d.f.(cid:5)2, P(cid:5)0.64) or with / / / carriers of allele 2 at the IL-1Ra locus (F(cid:5)2.197, / d.f.(cid:5)1, P(cid:5)0.141). / /

4. Discussion

3.1. IL-1 cluster genotype and allele frequency distributions

In a large sample of 1131 subjects, ranging from 20 to 102 years of age, no significant age-related changes of allele, genotype and haplotype frequency distributions of the IL-1 cluster polymorphisms were found. These results are in agreement with those recently published in nonagenarian Finnish subjects (Wang et al., 2001); indeed, it is remarkable that in these two genetically different populations (Finnish and Italians), the gene cluster distributions are quite similar.

estimated in a total of 1131 subjects from 20 to 102 years old. To perform a comparative analysis, the whole sample was divided into three age groups: young subjects (19(cid:1)65 years old; 688 individuals, 210 females / and 478 males), elderly subjects (65(cid:1)99 years old; 309 / individuals, 149 females and 160 males) and centenar- ians ((cid:1)99 years old; 134 individuals, 94 females and 40 / males). Table 1 shows the genotype frequency distribu- tions of the IL-1a (cid:2)889 locus, IL-1b (cid:2)511 locus and / / the IL-1Ra VNTR locus, in the three groups described above. Within each group, the genotype distributions were consistent with those predicted by the HWE (P  / 0.05). No significant difference in the genotype fre- quency distributions was observed, neither when the sexes were analysed together (Table 1) nor separately (data not shown). The analysis of the difference in the three groups of allele frequency distributions was also not significant (Table 2) even when the sexes were analysed separately (data not shown). The frequency

cluster polymorphisms are devoid of any functional significance in this respect; alternatively, the second is that IL-1 polymorphisms have a functional value, but they do not impinge upon longevity at the population level due to their limited impact on whole population mortality. In fact, the relationship between IL-1 gene cluster parameters and susceptibility to or severity of a variety of immunologically mediated diseases (Clay et al., 1994; Crusius et al., 1995; Heresbach et al., 1997; Hurme et al., 1998; Nemetz et al., 1999) as well as age- related diseases such as Alzheimer’s (Grimaldi et al., 2000; Licastro et al., 2000) and coronary single vessel disease (Francis et al., 1999), has been widely acknowl- edged. However, both the present work and the paper on Finnish nonagenarians suggest that the overall increase in the susceptibility to various diseases due to particular genotypes at the IL-1 cluster is likely to be small at the population level, indicating that even if these polymorphisms affect the progression of common age-related diseases, their importance is slight. In this regard, a number of genetic risk factors associated with major age-related diseases have been found to be under- represented in centenarians. This is the case for APOE

were consistent with those predicted by the HWE (P  / 0.05). No significant difference in the genotype fre- quency distributions was observed, neither when the sexes were analysed together (Table 1) nor separately (data not shown). The analysis of the difference in the three groups of allele frequency distributions was also not significant (Table 2) even when the sexes were analysed separately (data not shown). The frequency distribution of the three loci haplotypes was estimated in the three age groups by means of maximum likelihood estimation algorithm (Table 3). Again, no significant differences were detected.

3.2. IL-1Ra and IL-1b plasma levels during aging

IL-1Ra plasma levels were assessed in a group of 130 unrelated randomly selected subjects (71 females and 59 males) ranging from 20 to 102 years of age. Fig. 1 shows that IL-1Ra plasma levels showed a significant age-

Thus, the current data suggest that IL-1 cluster polymorphisms, in contrast to the genetic variation at other proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, have a negligible impact on human longevity. Moreover, we suggest that the age-related changes in the plasma

levels of IL-1Ra are not likely to be genetically controlled, but rather due to cytokine network reshap- ing, conceivable representing a safety mechanism to buffer the increased inflammatory state due to aging. An alternative hypothesis is that IL-1 gene polymorphisms in the populations are optimally set to cope with pathogenic agents and that such function is optimised, thus not allowing any change of genotype frequency distributions with age.
