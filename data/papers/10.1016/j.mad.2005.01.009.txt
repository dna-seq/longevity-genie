Abstract

A common polymorphism (I405V) in exon 14 of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene has been recently associated to healthy aging in Ashkenazi Jewish.

et al., 2004) reported, in a sample of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, a positive association of a common poly- morphism (I405V) in exon 14 of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP, 16q21) gene, currently discussed as a risk factor for heart diseases. The VV genotype was also correlated to lower CETP serum levels and larger lipoprotein particle sizes. Recent evidence supports a genetic influence on exceptional longevity (Geesaman et al., 2003), therefore, the identification of protective variants against age-related illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases, may provide an important contribution to better understanding healthy aging. Complex gene–environment and gene–gene interac- tions, resulting in epistatic or pleiotrophic effects, may yield a relevant function in longevity (Perls and Terry, 2003).

In our genetic study, we compare the I405V polymorph- ism distribution in 364 Caucasian subjects: 175 Italian centenarians (141 women and 34 men, mean age 99.6    2.6 years; 63% aged >100 years) and 189 sex-matched healthy individuals, as a control group (mean age 69.2    8.3 years). Subjects were enrolled from three Italian cities (Florence, Bologna and Pescara). The Ethical Committee from each institution approved the study. A detailed medical history was acquired from the centenarians and they or their caregiver gave a written informed consent after receiving a clear explanation of the study.

By using the demographic lists provided by the registry offices, potentially eligible subjects with exceptional long- evity were identified in the three city areas under study and 60% agreed to participate. The long-lived individuals were in good health, relatively to their very advanced age, and did not present the more common age-related pathologies (e.g.,

severe cognitive impairment, severe physical impairment, clinically evident cancer or renal insufficiency), although some had decreased auditory and visual acuity (categories A and B according to Franceschi et al., 2000). Healthy control subjects sharing the same ethnic and environmental background, such as a centenarian spouse or an individual matched to the long-lived subjects with respect to geo- graphical origin and economic history, were included in the study.

et al., 2004). We did not perform a more extensive genotype across the CETP gene, however the analysis of other different polymorphisms in this gene did not evidence associations in Japanese centenarians (Arai et al., 2003).

We could argue that several non-mutually exclusive factors including genetic components and other environ- mental and lifestyle aspects (e.g., nutrition habits, smoking, physical activities) may affect longevity in populations with different ethnic background. Thus, the effect on longevity of this functional polymorphism may not be detectable in Italians because of other gene environment interactions rather than genetic heterogeneity.

In addition, they were interviewed in order to exclude the presence of relatives with exceptional longevity in their past generations.

Briefly, the I405V CETP variant was detected using the PCR-RFLP method (Gudnason et al., 1999). Statistical analysis was performed byx2analysisassumingasignificance level of 5% using the Epi Info 2002 package. Power calculations were made using Genetic Power Calculator routines (http://calculators.stat.ucla.edu/powercalc/).

The major limitation of our study is the lack of data about CETP serum levels and lipid profile in the Italian centenarians in relation to genotype. Otherwise a previous report (Baggio et al., 1998) did not show a favorable lipid profile suggesting that a continuous and complex reshaping of lipid parameters likely contributes to longevity.

Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of the CETP variant in longevity. Due to the difficulties to recruit subjects of an extreme age, there is the need to plan a joined study analyzing larger samples of long-lived individuals from different populations, evaluating the correlation between the biological, clinical phenotype and the genotype. This should clarify if a CETP genotype is necessary or/and sufficient for successful aging or if such an association oscillates according to the various ethnic backgrounds and/ or other unknown sources of stratification.

The genotype and allele frequency distributions (Table 1), conforming to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( p > 0.05), were similar for the long-lived subjects and controls. The VV genotype (8.6%) and V allele (31%) frequencies in the Italian long-lived subjects differs from those previously reported by Barzilai and coworkers (24.8% for the VV genotype and 46% for the V allele) in Askenazi Jewish centenarians thus suggesting genetic heterogeneity among populations. We report here the lack of association of the valine (V) allele in the long-lived subjects. In fact a slight although not significant reduction in the Vallele (x2 = 1.75; p = 0.18) and VV genotype (x2 = 0.24; p = 0.63) frequen- cies was observed in centenarians.

Acknowledgments

Our genetic study on Italian centenarians does not confirm the association between the I405V CETP variation and the healthy aging phenotype described in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A further possible explanation for the inconsistency between our results and those mentioned above (Barzilai et al., 2003) may be that the CETP polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with another closed gene. We could not exclude that our result may represent a false-negative finding which is a common limitation in association studies. However, the sample size analysis demonstrated 73% power (odds ratio = 2, 5% significance) to test differences, providing evidence that our study is not underpowered and is able to detect even a marginal genetic effect of the allelic variants on phenotype. Several polymorphisms have been reported in the
