ABSTRACT 

The free radical theory of aging states that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in age-related accumulation of cellular damage and consequently influence aging and longevity. Therefore, variation in genes encoding proteins that protect against ROS could be expected to influence variation in aging and life span. The rs4880 and rs1050450 SNPs in the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) genes respectively are associated with age-related diseases and appear to affect the activities of the encoded variant proteins.

In this study, we genotyped these SNPs in 1650 individuals from the Danish 1905 cohort (follow-up time: 1998-2008; age at intake: 92-93 years; number of deaths: 1589 (96.3%)) and investigated the association with aging and longevity. We found decreased mortality of individuals holding either the MnSOD rs4880 C or the GPX1 rs1050450 T alleles (hazard ratio (MnSOD(CC/CT)) = 0.91, P = 0.002 and hazard ratio (GPX1(TT/TC)) = 0.93, p = 0.008). Furthermore, a synergistic effect of the alleles was observed (hazard ratio = 0.76, p = 0.001). Finally, moderate positive associations with good self-rated health, decreased disability and increased cognitive capacity were observed. Our results thus indicate that genetic variation in MnSOD and GPX1 may be associated with aging and longevity.

Introduction 

Genetic factors contribute to the variation in life span by approximately 25% (Herskind et al., 1996), a contribution believed to be minimal before age 60 years and most profound from age 85 years and onwards (Hjelmborg et al., 2006). The candidate genes encode proteins involved in several biological processes including the protection against oxidative stress (Christensen et al., 2006). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced because approximately 23% of the oxygen atoms taken up by the mitochondria are reduced insufficiently (Valko et al., 2004). ROS can oxidize and damage nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, thereby altering their stability and function. Thus, protein modifications (such as protein carbonylation and nitration) and the formation of lipid peroxidation adducts (e.g. 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)) can be the results of ROS damage. HNE might subsequently give rise to the exocyclic etheno adducts of adenine, cytosine and guanine in DNA. Moreover, exposure of nucleic acids to ROS can generate a wide variety of modified bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoguanine), which induces base-mispairing, being one of the most abundant. Furthermore, ROS exposure may also result in imidazol ring-opened derivatives of pyrimidines (FaPy products) and in single-strand breaks in DNA. Over time, the sum of these alterations contributes to deleterious cellular changes leading to dysfunction of mitochondria, cells and ultimately of the organism; that is, the damage-induced alterations contribute to aging and longevity (Harman, 1973; Harman, 1991). In addition, the damage-induced alterations have been associated with certain cancers and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders of old age (Antonella, 1999; Vijg, 2000).

Materials and methods 

Subjects 

Study participants were the Danish 1905 cohort, which includes all Danes born in 1905 (Nybo et al., 2001a). TheHypertension (Hsueh et al., 2005), sporadic motor neuron disease (Van Landeghem et al., 1999), Parkinson's disease (Shimoda-Matsubayashi et al., 1996), and Alzheimer's disease (Wiener et al., 2007).

2.2. Genotyping
DNA was isolated from cheek swabs or blood spots using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The Danish 1905 cohort was genotyped for the rs4880 MnSOD SNP and for the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP using Taqman technology. Rs4880 MnSOD SNP primers: 5'-GGCTGTGCTTTCTCGTCTTCA-3' (forward) and 5'-TCTGCCTGGAGCCCAGATAC-3' (reverse) and rs1050450 GPX1 SNP primers: 5'-CATCGAAGCCCTGCTGTCT-3' (forward) and 5'-CACTGCAACTGCCAAGCA-3' (reverse) were purchased from DNA Technology A/S (Denmark), while rs4880 MnSOD SNP probes: 5'-Vic-CGAGGCCGAAACCC-3' and 5'-Fam-ACCGAGGCCAAAACC-3' and rs1050450 GPX1 SNP probes: 5'-Vic-ACAGCTGGGCCCTT-3' and 5'-Fam-ACAGCTGAGCCCTT-3' were purchased from Applied Biosystems (UK). DNA was amplified in a total volume of 10 ml containing 5 ml Taqman Universal MasterMix (Applied Biosystems), 900 nM of each primer, 200 nM of each probe, and 10 ng template DNA. PCR was performed in the ABI Prism 17700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer, and the PCR data were analyzed using the Sequence Detector software version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems). 37 of the 1650 cohort members could not be genotyped with certainty for the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP due to poor quality of the DNA sample.

The human gene encoding GPX1 is designated GPX1 (http://www.genenames.org/data/hgnc_data.php?hgnc_id=4553). GPX1 contains a c.599C>T SNP (previously referred to as c.593C>T), which is also referred to as rs1050450 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1050450). The SNP leads to a proline > leucine substitution; hence, the SNP is also referred to as p.P200L (however, previously it was referred to as Pro198Leu (see e.g. Moscow et al., 1994)). The SNP likely affects the activity of the variant proteins (Ravn-Haren et al., 2006). In this paper, we will refer to the SNP as the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP. The T allele of the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP has been associated with bladder, lung, and breast cancers (Ratnasinghe et al., 2000; Hu and Diamond, 2003; Ichimura et al., 2004), diabetic-associated atherosclerosis (Hamanishi et al., 2004), intracerebral hemorrhage (Pera et al., 2008), metabolic syndrome (Kuzuya et al., 2008), and coronary artery disease (Tang et al., 2008).

2.3. Statistics
The STATA 10.0 statistical program (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis. The x2 test was used for comparing genotype frequencies and for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing. For comparing the functional and cognitive abilities between groups, linear regression was applied. Mortality risks/hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Statistical significance was set as P < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Genotype frequencies
The genotype frequencies of the rs4880 MnSOD SNP and of the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP in the Danish 1905 cohort are summarized in Table 1. The allele frequencies for the rs4880 MnSOD SNP were 49.9% for C and 50.1% for T, while for the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP they were 69.1% for C and 30.9% for T, which correspond with previous reports in Caucasians (Ambrosone et al., 1999; Van Landeghem et al., 1999spelling errors or incorrectly combined words in the text. However, there are some grammatical errors that need to be corrected.

The processed text is:

0.296, 95%CI = [0.0189 0.0622], N = 1633). With respect to the rs1050450 GPX SNP, a positive statistically significant sex-adjusted coefficient of 0.0783 (P = 0.039, 95%CI = [0.0039 0.1528], N (CT) = 726) was found for the CT genotype, while a positive but non-significant coefficient of 0.0359 (P = 0.605, 95%CI = [0.1001 0.1719], N (TT) = 129) was found for the TT genotype. The combined CT/TT group showed a statistically significant coefficient of 0.0216 (P = 0.049, 96%CI = [0.0002 0.0717], N = 1596). Still, a moderate increase in ADL score may indicate that the individuals holding the genotypes associated with decreased mortality tended to be less disabled, which corresponds well with a tendency of better self-reported health. Finally, the MMSE criteria showed a positive coefficient for the rs4880 MnSOD SNP CC/CT group; sex-adjusted coefficient CC/CT = 0.404 (P = 0.015, 95%CI = [0.0790 0.7296], N = 1582). With respect to the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP, a coefficient of 0.307 (P = 0.309, 95%CI = [0.2855 0.9001], N (CT) = 708) for the CT genotype and a coefficient of 0.267 (P = 0.627, 95%CI = [1.3484 0.8131], N (TT) = 126) for the TT genotype were found. Nevertheless, a moderate increase in MMSE for the rs4880 MnSOD SNP genotype individuals indicates a moderate increase in cognitive function of the individuals holding the genotypes associated with decreased mortality.

4. Discussion

3.3. Gender-related differences in survival

In this paper, we show associations of the rs4880 MnSOD SNP and of the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP with longevity, indicating that variation in the genes encoding MnSOD and GPX1 may influence the variation in human lifespan. Due to minimal immigration into the Danish 1905 cohort, population stratification is minimized; hence, the cohort must be considered to be genetically homogeneous. When looking at males and females separately, it was observed that the effect of the advantageous rs4880 MnSOD and of the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP genotypes on mortality seemed to be most pronounced for males (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows an example of this difference in survival: the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for the rs4880 MnSOD SNP CC/CT and TT genotypes for females (Fig. 2A) and males (Fig. 2B) separately. When calculating the HR for the CC/CT genotype,Difference. Hence, it might be that the rs1050450 GPX1 SNP genotypes (CT and TT) we find to be associated with decreased mortality in the oldest old may be the variant holding slightly lower activity. This seems somehow contradictory to the idea that efficient antioxidant enzyme activity contributes to reduced mortality. However, oxidative stress is believed also to have beneficial effects; moderate levels of ROS or a temporary increase in ROS levels have positive effects on cellular homeostasis (Droge, 2002; Radak et al., 2008). Hence, there is probably a delicate balance between the advantageous and disadvantageous effects of ROS, and the relation between ROS and lifespan is probably not as straightforward as low ROS levels (possibly ensured by efficient antioxidant enzymes) equaling increased lifespan. Finally, a slightly more active GPX1 could lead to increased OH levels due to decreased levels of reduced glutathione. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that a slight decrease in GPX1 activity (in the TT and CT rs1050450 GPX1 SNP genotypes) could have a positive effect on longevity. These results indicate that the genetic variation in the rs4880 MnSOD SNP might lead to a difference in MnSOD activity in the matrix and hence to a difference in oxidant-antioxidant balance. CC (alanine-alanine) and CT (alanine-valine) individuals would likely hold a higher MnSOD activity (than TT (valine-valine) individuals) and hence have less O2 accumulation in the matrix, which could lead to lower damage levels (as compared to TT (valine-valine) individuals). Such a difference in antioxidant activity and damage level could (according to the free radical theory of aging) be expected to affect the lifespan of the individual. This is indeed what we observe: the CC (alanine-alanine)/CT (alanine-valine) individuals hold reduced mortality as compared to TT (valine-valine) individuals. However, there are a few studies which have not been able to find support for the correlation between genotype and activity as observed by Sutton et al. Two studies measuring the MnSOD activity in mitochondrial extracts of erythrocytes have been reported: Bastaki et al. (2006) observed a 33% reduced activity in CC extracts as compared to CT/TT extracts, while Elsakka et al. (2007) detected no difference. The difference between these two studies might be explained by a difference in mitochondrial purification, activity measurement procedures, and sample sizes (Bastaki et al.: 102 males and 129 females and Elsakka et al.: 20 individuals). Moreover, when measuring the MnSOD activity in mitochondrial extracts, the genetic background of the individuals can influence the activity; hence the difference in results may be due to genetic variation. We observe a difference between genders in the effects of genotypes on mortality; the effects are apparently more pronounced in males. Bastaki et al. (2006) observed a 16% decreased MnSOD activity in males as compared to females. Since the proposed hampering of the T variant is only partial and if women, in general, hold a slightly higher MnSOD activity, it can be speculated that the MnSOD activity in female TT individuals could reach a threshold of activity enabling them to overcome (at least in part) the oxidative stress, perhaps resulting in a less severe effect of the increased mortality in TT genotype individuals observed in our study. For GPX1, the activity in males also appears to be lower than in females; Bastaki et al. (2006) reported it to be 7.7% lower, whereas Blankenberg measured a 5% difference (Blankenberg et al., Development ( ) glutathione peroxidase and catalase in humans. Pharmacogenet.
