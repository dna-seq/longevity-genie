Studies in model organisms have demonstrated that SIR2 genes control lifespan while no data are available regarding a possible role of SIRT3 in human longevity. By analyzing the genotype-specific survival function relevant to the G477T marker of SIRT3, we found that in males the TT genotype increases (p < 0.0272), while the GT genotype decreases (p < 0.0391) survival in the elderly. Since SIRT3 lies in a chromosomal region (11p15.5) where four genes potentially associated with longevity are located (HRAS1, Insulin-like Growth Factor 2, Proinsulin, and Tyrosine Hydroxylase), we tested for linkage-disequilibrium between G477T alleles and alleles of the above genes. The disequilibrium was not significant in any case, thus suggesting that SIRT3 itself, or a gene strictly linked to SIRT3, may have a role in human longevity. Keywords: SIRT3 gene; Human longevity; Silent Information Regulator 2 homologue. 

1. Introduction. The role played by Sir2p as NAD-dependent protein deacetylase links cellular metabolism, transcriptional silencing and aging (Guarente, 2000), and it has been proposed that SIR2 genes may regulate aging in many species, possibly by coordinating the pace of aging to the metabolic rate (Guarente and Kenyon, 2000; Guarente, 2001). The SIRT3 gene (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim: MIM 604481; contig NT_035113) lies at the telomeric terminal on the 11p15.5 chromosome. Allelic association studies carried out in people older than 100 years showed that a relationship exists between longevity and polymorphism of four genes located in this region. In particular, by analyzing an STR marker of the Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) gene, as well as the haplotypes defined by this marker and RFLPs of Proinsulin (INS) and Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) genes, significant age-related variations of the allelic pool had been observed (De Luca et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2002); similar age-related variations were also found for the 30 VNTR marker of the HRAS1 gene (Bonafe` et al., 2002). The HRAS1 gene (contig NT_035113) lies at 0.665 Mb from the telomere, while the genes IGF2, INS and TH lie at 2.112, 2.140, and 2.145 Mb, respectively, from the telomeric terminal and are comprised within the contig NT_028310. Therefore, within a short piece of chromosome, five genes potentially involved in longevity are located.

2. Materials and methods. An appropriate campaign of recruitment was launched in Calabria (southern Italy) for genetic studies on aging in 1999, except for centenarians whose recruitment started beginning from 1994. The recruitment campaign was focused on university students and staff for 18-60 years old people, thermal baths and aged people-Academy for 60-80 years old people. As to the centenarians, they were identified through the birth registers of the Municipalities of Calabria and then contacted. Only subjects born and living in Calabria were invited to take part in the study and after a detailed explanation of the researchParticipating cohorts in the cross-sectional study were assessed for linkage disequilibrium D using the method described by Weir (1996). The null hypothesis D = 0 was tested between the G477T marker of SIRT3 and previously analyzed markers at the loci HRAS1 (BonafÃ¨ et al., 2002) and IGF2, INS, TH (De Luca et al., 2001). Haplotypic frequencies were estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Arlequin 1.1 software. 

A 738 bp DNA fragment was extracted from the blood buffy coats of 50 randomly selected subjects. Variability in the evolutionary conserved domain of the SIRT3 gene (exon 2-exon 3) was searched for, identifying a silent G/T transversion at position 477 of the coding region (G477T corresponding to Ser159Ser; AF083108). This marker was used to investigate possible modifications of the SIRT3 gene pool in people of increasing age, including the oldest old. In males, the TT genotype increased (p = 0.0272), while the GT genotype decreased (p = 0.0391) the value of the survival function; the GG genotype did not significantly affect survival function (p = 0.871) (Figs.13). 

The association between SIRT3 variability and survival was found to be restricted to males, as previously observed for other loci (see Franceschi et al., 2000; De Luca et al., 2001 and references therein). Since the association between SIRT3 and survivorship could be due to allelic associations, we tested for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the G477T marker of SIRT3 and markers of other genes spanning for 1.5 Mb about in the same region and associated with longevity (HRAS1, IGF2, INS, TH). LD was checked between the G477T polymorphism and HRAS1-30 VNTR; IGF2-Ava II-RFLP; INS-Fok I-RFLP, and HUMTHO.1-STR. Results are shown in Tables 1-4, respectively, where it can be seen that the null hypothesis D = 0 cannot be rejected in any case. 

The observed association could be due to LD either with a functional variant of the SIRT3 gene itself or of other genes occurring in this neighborhood. Negative findings obtained in LD analysis (Tables 1-4) show that the relationship between the G477T marker of SIRT3 and survivorship is not due to gene/longevity associations previously found in the same 11p15.5 region, thus reinforcing the hypothesis of D-linkage between the G477T variant and an unknown functional variant of SIRT3 itself. 

Whatever the functional variant may be, an association between a marker of SIRT3 and survivorship has been found. The possibility that the Sir2p human homologue has a role in aging is in line with the idea that modulators of the rate of aging are conserved over large evolutionary distances (Partridge and Gems, 2002). These findings indicate that Sir2p activity may be an evolutionary conserved check point of this complex interplay (Chang and Ming, 2002) and therefore agree with the idea that SIRT3 is a strong candidate in longevity taking into account findings in model organisms.Variability may modulate human aging. Additionally, the localization of the SIRT3 protein to mitochondria is in line with models that put mitochondria as central actors in the network connecting metabolic rate, gene expression modulation, and lifespan. HUMTHO.1-STR alleles are named according to the number of STR repeats; allele 10* contains the imperfect repeat (De Luca et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2002). Haplotypic frequencies are estimated by the maximum likelihood method (Arlequin 1.1 software). The hypothesis D=0 is not rejected (p=0.482 ^ 0.002).

4. Discussion
By applying a demographic-genetic approach (Yashin et al., 1999), a significant variation of survivorship was found in the elderly related to the genotypes defined by the G477T polymorphism of the SIRT3 gene. Although it is possible that such an association is due to chance, the statistical significance of the finding seems to indicate otherwise. The location of five genes potentially involved in human aging (HRAS1, SIRT3, IGF2, INS, TH) in a restricted chromosomal region, 11p15.5, is intriguing and suggests an evolutionarily conserved control of shared regulatory elements (Hurst et al., 2002). Some preliminary results obtained by gene expression studies indicate that this may be the case at least for some of the above 11p15.5 genes (Bellizzi et al., 2002). 

In conclusion, a demographic genetic approach has discovered a male-specific relationship between a marker of SIRT3 and survivorship. This finding shows that variability of a gene which affects lifespan in experimental organisms is associated with longevity in humans. Furthermore, SIRT3's chromosomal location close to other genes associated with longevity opens intriguing questions about the significance of this finding in the light of current evolutionary theories on aging and longevity (Partridge and Gems, 2002).
