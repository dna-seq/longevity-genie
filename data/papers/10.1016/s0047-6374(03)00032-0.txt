Abstract

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an HLA-linked inherited disease characterised by inappropriately high absorption of iron by the gastrointestinal mucosa. The cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at codon 282 of the HFE encoding gene sequence is responsible for the disease, although other variants, as H63D and S65C, may modify the affinity of the protein for transferrin receptors. We have recently reported that C282Y mutation is significantly increased in very old ((cid:1)90 years) Sicilian women, suggesting a role in / attainment of longevity. In addition, an increase of H63D polymorphism was also observed in these women but the difference was not significant. To validate and extend these results we investigated the distribution of these three common HFE gene mutations in Sardinian centenarians and controls. DNA samples, obtained from 61 controls and 57 Centenarians, were typed for HFE polymorphisms using sequence specific primers. Among the controls, none was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, 15 were heterozygous for H63D mutation and one for S65C. Among the centenarians, none was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation whereas 25 were heterozygous for H63D mutation and four for the S65C mutation. No significant differences were observed in frequencies of the different alleles between young and centenarians both on the whole and when the data were analysed according to gender. However, there was a trend for an increased frequency of H63D allele in centenarian women (24 vs. 17%, i.e. 19/80 vs. 13/ 78). It is noteworthy that the cumulative frequency of H63D mutations in Centenarian and very old women from Sardinia and Sicily is 22 vs. 11%, i.e. 30/136 vs. 23/210, P(cid:1)0.008. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be a survival / difference for centenarian women, among carriers and non-carriers of alleles involved in iron sparing. # 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction

lost its ability to bind peptides due to a definitive closure of the antigen-binding cleft. This protein, instead, has acquired the ability to form complex with the receptor for iron-binding transferrin, so by regulating iron uptake. Thus, it indirectly regulates immune responses too, because iron availability plays a role in specific and non-specific immune responses. A cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at codon 282 of the HFE encoding gene sequence is responsible for the disease. However, other variants, as H63D and S65C, may modify the affinity of the protein for transferrin receptors. The distribution of these mutations differs in different populations (Feder et

4. Discussion

In the present study, we have not been able to confirm in Sardinian centenarians the increase of C282Y muta- tion observed in Sicilian oldest old women. This datum is not surprising because the frequency of C282Y mutation is very low in the Mediterranean basin (Merryweather-Clarke et al., 1997; Campo et al., 2001; Lucotte, 2001; Balistreri et al., 2002). Besides Sardinian population is an ancient genetic isolate with a gene pool characterized by polymorphisms that are rare elsewhere, so the HLA ancestral haplotype 7.1. that usually carries this mutation is virtually absent in the Sardinian population (Contu et al., 1992; Rendine et al., 1998; Dawkins et al., 1999; Klein and Sato, 2000). However, we observed an increase of the other two mutations. This trend was not significant, but it is noteworthy that the cumulative frequency of H63D mutations in cen- tenarian and very old women from Sardinia and Sicily (Lio et al., 2002) was 22 vs. 11%, i.e. 30/136 vs. 23/210

We have recently reported that C282Y mutation may confer a selective advantage in term of longevity to Sicilian women. As matter of the fact, C282Y mutation was significantly increased both in very old men and women, but by comparing the allele frequencies to those of young people significance was attained only in very old women. Interestingly in these subjects an increase of H63D polymorphism was also observed but the differ- ence was not significant (Lio et al., 2002). To validate and extend these results, in this study, we investigated the distribution of these three common HFE gene mutations C282Y, H63D, S65C in Sardinian centenar- ians and controls.

2. Materials and methods

there may be a survival difference for very old women, among carriers and non-carriers of alleles involved in iron sparing. It is well known that heterozygotes for mutations in HFE have a higher iron content (Burt et al., 1998; Steinberg et al., 2001), but it has until now been assumed that this was without significant influence on morbidity and mortality rates. Our study does not shed light on which mechanisms are behind this longer life expectancy. However, it is tempting to suggest that the difference is owing to accumulation of iron, but this should be further investigated. In the previous report on Sicilian population, considering the historical and social contest in which the generation of women under study lived, we have suggested that the possession of iron sparing alleles significantly increases women possibility to reach longevity. For instance, in Sicily as well in Sardinia and in other pre-industrial countries, a lot of pregnancies and an iron-poor diet, consisted mainly in grains, vegetables and fruits, were yet the rule for the women born at the beginning of last century (Shorter, 1982). Future research needs to elucidate this point by analysing other populations.

Genomic DNA samples for this study were obtained through AKEA (the name ‘AKEA’ is derived from an expression in the Sardinian language that means ‘health and life for 100 years!’) study of Sardinian centenarians (Deiana et al., 1999). At the time of the present study, DNA samples for HFE typing were available from 57 centenarians (age range from 100 to 105; 17 men and 40 women) and from 60 controls (60 years old; 21 men and 39 women). Samples were typed for C282Y, H63D and S65C alleles using polymerase chain reaction and sequence specific primers as previously reported (Lio et al., 2002). HFE allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared by Monte-Carlo x2-test implemented in SPSS package (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).

3. Results

Among the young individuals, none was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. Fifteen subjects were hetero- zygous for H63D mutation and one for S65C. Among the centenarians, none was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, whereas 25 were heterozygous for H63D mutation and four for the S65C mutation. No signifi- cant differences were observed in frequencies of the different alleles between young and centenarians both on the whole (Table 1) and when the data were analysed according to gender (data not shown). However, there was a trend for an increased frequency of H63D mutation in centenarians. In particular, the frequency of H63D allele was higher in centenarian women than in control women (24 vs. 17%, i.e. 19/80 vs. 13/78).

It is seemingly puzzling that HFE mutations have been suggested to be involved in unsuccessful ageing too. In fact, these mutations have been suggested to be involved in Alzheimer disease, in chronic liver diseases, and coronary heart disease (Bathum et al., 2001; Balistreri et al., 2002; Candore et al., 2002). However, it is not surprising that HFE mutations are associated both with longevity and diseases affecting life span. In fact, available data from genetics of longevity (Caruso et al., 2000, 2001) show that longevity may be associated with alleles with increased risk to a variety of diseases in the younger phases of life (antagonistic pleiotropy).

theory is also a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy with a recent study performed in Denmark. In a C282Y mutation high-carrier frequency population as Denmark (Lucotte 2001; Bathum et al., 2001), this mutation shows an age-related reduction in the fre- quency of heterozygotes for C282Y, which suggests that carrier status is associated with shorter life expectancy. The observed reduction in C282Y mutation carrier frequency persists until age 95 years; however, the frequency in the centenarian group was the same as that in the youngest group for both men and women (Bathum et al., 2001). So, in that study heterozygosity for C282Y has a higher mortality rate in the younger groups but becomes beneficial in the oldest old.

All together present and previous reports seem to strongly suggest that longevity is the results of interac- tion between genetic and environmental factors that in different age, gender and population may result in a successful or unsuccessful ageing.
