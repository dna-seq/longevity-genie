conducted a case–control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human longevity, comparing autosomal SNPs in 763 long-lived individuals (LLI; mean age: 99.7 years) and 1085 controls age: 60.2 years) from Germany. Only one association, namely that of SNP rs4420638 near the gene, achieved genome-wide significance (allele-based P = 1.8 Bx 1 10(cid:3)10). However, logistic analysis revealed that this association, which was replicated in an independent German is fully explicable by linkage disequilibrium with the APOE allele e4, the only variant hitherto as a major genetic determinant of survival into old age. Our GWAS failed to identify any autosomal susceptibility genes. One explanation for this lack of success in our study would be provide only limited statistical power for a polygenicphenotype with loci ofsmalleffect such human longevity. A recent GWAS in Dutch LLI independently confirmed the APOE–longevity thus strengthening the conclusion that this locus is a very, if not the most, important genetic influencing longevity.

1. Introduction

that predisposes to both Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases (Corder et al., 1993; Panza et al., 2004). APOE e4 is the only variant with a reportedly large adverse effect upon survival at advanced age (Scha¨chter et al., 1994), and this association has been replicated in several populations (Christensen et al., 2006). Variation in the human forkhead box O3A gene (FOXO3A), in contrast, has been found to be associated with the ability to live long, an effect corroborated by studies in Japanese, German, Italian, US-American, Jewish, Chinese and Danish populations (Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2010; Willcox et al., 2008). More recently, we have identified exonuclease 1 (EXO1) as a potential novel longevity gene (Nebel et al., 2009). All three genes were detected through candidate-gene approaches.

Approximately 25–30% of the variation in adult lifespan is attributable to genetic factors that become more important with increasing age and exert their strongest effects in nonagenarians and centenarians (Go¨gele et al., 2010; Hjelmborg et al., 2006). As yet, however, only a few genetic variants have been found consistently to influence longevity. The first to be discovered was the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, a mortality factor

A few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the longevity phenotype have been reported so far. In 2007, a

genome-wide screening for longevity-related traits in a commu- nity-based population was published, but independent replication of its results is still pending (Lunetta et al., 2007). A meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies of individuals reaching 90 years and older observed an association of SNP rs9664222 near the gene MINPP1, which did not reach genome-wide significance, but was replicated independently (Newman et al., 2010). A case–control GWAS, including a large sample of US-American centenarians, reported 33 replicated genome-wide significant SNPs (Sebastiani et al., in press), but the validity of the results is still critically discussed (Editorial Expression of Concern; http://www.science- mag.org/content/330/6006/912.2.full). More recently, a GWAS in Dutch nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study identified a SNP, which tagged the deleterious effects of the APOE e4 allele (Deelen et al., in press).

TaqMan1SNP Genotyping Assays and the SNPlex1 Genotyping System Biosystems, Foster City, USA) on an automated platform (Hampe et al., 2001).

Data storage, quality control, and association analysis were performed using a customized database, R v2.7.1 (R Development Team, 2008) (http://www.R- project.org) and PLINKv1.04 (Purcell et al., 2007). Only autosomal SNPs with high- quality genotypes were included in subsequent analyses: SNPs were included if they had (a) a call rate   95% in cases and controls and (b) a minor allele frequency (MAF)   0.02 in controls or if jMAF(controls)   MAF(cases)j > 0.02 (see Fig. 2 for Manhattan-plot and Supplementary Fig. 1 for Q–Q-plot) and (c) P value of Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls >0.01. A total of 664,472 SNPs passed qualitycontrol.Toreducetherateoffalse-positiveresults,thegenotypingqualityof the 1600 most significantly associated SNPs (with P values of up to 9.6   10(cid:3)6) was investigatedbyvisualinspectionofthecorrespondingclusterplots(Supplementary Figs.2and3). MoredetailedqualitycontrolforGWASandfollow-upisdescribedin detail in Supplementary methods. Genotype–phenotype associations were assessed for statistical significance using a Cochran–Armitage trend (CAT) test and Fisher’s exact test, with the latter applied to both an allele- (CCA) and a genotype-based (CCG) case–control comparison. Population stratification was low (genomic inflation (GC) factor (Devlin and Roeder, 1999) for stage 1 l: 1.064 and stage 2 l: 1.06). GC-adjusted P values were calculated according to Devlin and Roeder (1999). Logistic regression analysis of rs4420638 and APOE e4 status as influence variables was conducted with and without interaction using R v2.7.1 (R Development Team, 2008). To this end, genotypes were encoded by the number of the major allele of rs4420638 or the e4 allele (APOE), respectively. All tests were two-sided.

Here, we report upon a GWAS using a case–control study design in which we compared more than 760 centenarians and nonagenarians, who represent an exceptional longevity pheno- type, with more than 1000 younger controls. We replicated and confirmed APOE as the major genetic determinant of survival into old age. In addition, when we tested the 33 SNPs of Sebastiani et al. in our samples, only the APOE-related marker rs2075650 showed a significant association.

2. Materials and methods

2.4. Haplotype analysis

Stage 1 data were also subjected to a haplotype-based association analysis, using a two-marker sliding window. To this end, maximum-likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies were obtained and posterior probabilities of haplotypic genotypes calculated for each individual. The latter were included in a score test for association with a binary phenotype, assuming an additive risk model for haplotypes. SNPs involved in the 5000 most significantly associated haplotypes were subjected to visual inspection of the corresponding cluster plots (see Supplementary methods). Haplotypes for which both SNPs passed the inspection were genotyped and analyzed in stage 2. The analysis was carried out in R v2.7.1 (R Development Team, 2008), using the haplo.score function of R package haplo.stats v1.3.8 (Schaid et al., 2002), which takes phase uncertainty into account.

In stage 1 we conducted a GWAS where a total of 763 unrelated German long- lived individuals (LLI) were studied who were between 94 and 110 years of age (meanage:99.7years;Table1).The1085Germancontrolindividualsinstage1(age range: 45–77 years; mean age: 60.2 years) were obtained from the Popgen (Krawczak et al., 2006) and KORA (Wichmann et al., 2005) biobanks. The regional genetic differences between northern and southern Germany are not significant (Lao et al., 2008; Steffens et al., 2006) and therefore the two populations were pooled.Thesexratiowasapproximately1:1.The754LLIusedforvalidationinstage 2hadanagerangeof95–108yearsandameanageof96.9years.Thestage2control sample of 860 individuals (age range: 60–75 years; mean age: 67.3 years) was matched to the LLI as closely as possible in terms of ancestry, gender and geographical origin. The sex ratio in this sample was 12:1 in favor of females. The lack of men in stage 2 implies that any male-specific effects that were observed in theinitialscreeningmaynotbedetectableinthefollow-upsample.Thedescription for the stage 1 samples is given in detail elsewhere (Krawczak et al., 2006; Nebel etal.,2005;Wichmannet al.,2005).Forstage2itispublishedinNebelet al.(2005). There are no mortality data available for the controls. However, based on current predictions only 1.5% of all 60-year old and 1.8% of all 75-year old German females will become 100 years (to become 95 years old the respective proportions are 9.5% for60-yearold and12.3%for75-yearold women).The probabilityformalesiseven lower (Human Mortality Database: www.demogr.mpg.de). Hence, we can estimate that only a negligible proportion of younger controls will become long-lived. The French sample used to investigate rs12741354 in ASTN1 comprised 536 centenarians (mean age: 103.7 years) and 508 younger controls (mean age: 50.8 years). Cases andcontrols were matchedfor gender and geographicorigin (Blanche´ et al., 2001). The sex ratio was 5:1 in favor of females.

2.5. Testing for association of 33 SNPs from Sebastiani et al. in German samples

To test the association findings of the study by Sebastiani et al. which were obtained from Illumina 370 CNV chips and Illumina 610 arrays, the German Affymetrix GWAS data had to be imputed, since different genotyping technologies hadbeenused.Genotypeimputationwascarriedout usingahiddenMarkovmodel algorithm implemented in the software program BEAGLE v3.1.1 (Browning and Browning, 2009) and the HapMap 3 samples from the CEU, TSI, MEX and GIH populations to infer missing autosomal genotypes in silico. To take imputation uncertainty into account, association analysis between the phenotype and the dosage data (expected allele counts) was performed using PLINK’s logistic regression framework for dosage data (with flag-dosage).

We have ranked the SNPs according to their minimum (P ) of min P , P , and P . A total of 58,903 markers (8.9%) showed a CAT CCA CCG nominal P value <0.05. To reduce the rate of false-positive min results, cluster plots of the 1600 most significantly associated SNPs (all with P values (cid:5)9.6  10(cid:3)6) were subjectedto post hoc visual min

2.2. Genotyping

The Affymetrix1 Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (San Francisco, CA, USA) was used to genotype the individuals in stage 1 (Supplementary methods). For validation, markers were genotyped in the individuals from stage 2 with

association did not withstand Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni- adjusted P = 0.091 assuming 13 tests; see Supplementary CCA methods). As SNP rs12741354 had the second lowest P value, it was also investigated in an independent collection of 536 French centenarians (mean age: 103.7 years) and 508 younger controls (mean age: 50.8 years) (power: 65.5%) where it failed to show any association with longevity (P = 0.86); Supplementary CCA Table 1).

(Supplementary methods) and were selected for follow-up (Table 2). Their nominal P values ranged from 1.8 a 10(cid:3)10 to CCA 9.5   10(cid:3)6. Due to multiple testing in GWAS usually low initial P values in stage 1 are required in order to be able to replicate the association. Our follow-up study has not sufficient power to detect SNP-effects in stage 2 with higher P values (>10(cid:3)5). Therefore, additional SNPs were not included in our follow-up. Only the association between longevity and SNP rs4420638 near the APOC1 gene achieved genome-wide significance (Bonferroni-adjusted P = 1.2   10(cid:3)4, based upon 664,472 tests and assuming no CCA correlation between SNPs; see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The significance of the other 15 SNPs did not withstand Bonferroni correction, thereby highlighting the need for independent valida- tion.

3.4. APOE

The array-based genotypes of SNP rs4420638 were confirmed 1 by a TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay (99.4% concordance). SNP rs4420638 is located 14 kb downstream of the APOE locus (Corder et al., 1993) and has previously been shown to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the latter (Coon et al., 2007). Defining APOE e4 by intragenic SNP rs429358, we were able to confirm this LD in the German control sample of stage 2 (r2 = 0.72, D0 = 0.97). Logistic regression analysis including both rs4420638 genotype and APOE e4 status showed that the longevity association of rs4420638 was explicable by its LD with APOE (P = 0.57 for the association between longevity and rs4420638, after adjustment for e4 status). SNP rs4420638 was not further analyzed in the French as this is the sample in which the APOE–longevity association was originally detected (Scha¨chter et al., 1994).

3.2. Stage 2 analyses

The 16 SNPs selected for follow-up were next genotyped in an additional sample of 754 German LLI (mean age: 96.9 years) and 860 controls (mean age: 67.3 years; stage 2; Table 1), matched for ancestry, gender and geographical origin within Germany. This sample had a nominal power between 83% and 99% to detect the initially observed associations at the 5% significance level (with Bonferroni correction, the power was between 51% and 93%). However, only the association between longevity and rs4420638 was replicated (P = 1.1   10(cid:3)8, Bonferroni adjusted CCA P = 1.3 Sx  10(cid:3)7, Table 3), yielding a P value <2.2 Lx 10(cid:3)16 in CCA CCA the combined analysis of stage 1 and stage 2.

3.5. FOXO3A and EXO1

The recently confirmed longevity gene FOXO3A (Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2010; Willcox et al., 2008) and the longevity candidate EXO1 (Nebel et al., 2009) yielded compara- tively high P values of 0.007 and 0.035, respectively, and were CCA therefore far too large to qualify for follow-up in stage 2.

Another SNP, rs12741354 in the astrotactin 1 (ASTN1) gene, yielded a nominally significant P value of 0.007, but this CCA

Table 4

for SNPs included in the 5000 most significantly associated haplotypes yielded only 19 marker pairs with high-quality genotypes for both SNPs. Of these, two haplotypes including the APOE locus and four redundant haplotypes from a region of strong LD on chromosome 6 were not considered for follow-up. Thus, 13 haplotype pairs were chosen for validation in the stage 2 samples. However, none of them showed a significant haplotype association with longevity, neither in the stage 2 sample as a whole (Table 4) nor in the subset of centenarians (data not shown).

A recent GWAS identified 70 genome-wide significant SNPs, 33 of which were subsequently replicated in an additional sample (Sebastiani et al., in press). Here, we tested these 33 SNPs for association with longevity in our large German collection. Except for SNP rs2075650 (P value = 7.5  10(cid:3)6, Table 5), which is in high LD with the known APOE alleles (Sebastiani et al., in press; Yu et al., 2007), none of the other markers showed a significant association in our study.

3.6. Haplotype analysis

We also conducted a genome-wide haplotype-based associa- tion analysis, using a sliding window comprising pairs of consecutive SNPs. Out of the 677,291 two-marker haplotypes considered, 51,912 (7.7%) showed a nominally significant associa- tion with longevity in a score test assuming an additive risk model for haplotypes (P < 0.05).

additional susceptibility loci for longevity. This result is in marked contrast to other complex phenotypes, for which GWAS have successfully uncovered multiple genetic risk factors at unprece- dented speed and with high levels of reproducibility (Esparza- Gordillo et al., 2009; Franke et al., 2008; Hofmann et al., 2008). One explanation for this lack of success in our study would be that GWAS provide only limited statistical power for a polygenic phenotype with loci of small effect such as human longevity. GWAS are more suitable for the detection of genetic variants with large effects, which presumably explain only a small fraction of the total variation (Barrett et al., 2008). It is assumed that many causal gene variants, each with a weak to moderate contribution, influence our ability to become long-lived (Christensen et al., 2006). A recent study supports this notion and concludes that the alleles with small individual effects may jointly influence life span so that the resulting impact can be both substantial and significant (Yashin et al., 2010). Another case in point is the fact that the recently detected longevity gene FOXO3A (Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2010; Willcox et al., 2008) and the candidate EXO1 (Nebel et al., 2009) yielded P values in our GWAS of 0.007 and CCA 0.035, respectively. These P values were far too large to qualify the corresponding SNPs for follow-up in stage 2, suggesting that most genetic factors of similarly small effect (i.e. OR   1.4) were unfortunately likely to be missed by our study. Furthermore, especially male-specific effects could not be detected in our sample due to the small number of men in the replication study. The German and French centenarian/LLI samples used here are among the largest to-date and yet, they may not have been sufficiently powerful to detect small-effect variants in a longevity GWAS. The German sample used in stage 1, for example, had a power of 3.2% to detect an association of an OR of 1.4 (minor allele frequency of 50% and applying a significance level of 7.5  10(cid:3)8 (Supplementary Fig. 5)).

A previous meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies revealed a statistically significant and replicated association of rs9664222 with longevity (defined as reaching 90 years and older) (Newman et al., 2010). This SNP did not show any association in our large case–control samples (P = 0.611). This CCA result could be due to the different designs and/or levels of statistical power of the two studies. Moreover, we also tested the 33 polymorphisms from Sebastiani et al. (in press) in our imputed GWAS data set, of which SNP rs2075650 that is in LD with the known APOE alleles (Sebastiani et al., in press) showed a significant association in our German sample. Also the Dutch GWAS identified an APOE-related SNP as the most relevant marker with a deleterious effect on survival into old age. No other major longevity locus was found (Deelen et al., in press). Thus, our and the independent Dutch study (Deelen et al., in press) both strengthen the conclusion that APOE is a very important genetic factor and it may very well be the most relevant one influencing human longevity.

In summary, the GWAS, as it was carried out in our study, revealed apart from APOE no novel candidate genes for longevity in humans. Larger samples, a more specific and genetically enriched longevity phenotype (so-called ‘super-centenarians’) or a meta- analysis involving several thousands of participants may be required to successfully and reliably identify additional genes through a GWAS. In addition, some genetic factors involved in longevity could not be detected in the present study on principal ground, including low-frequency polymorphisms, copy-number variations or epigenetic changes. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that although individual-specific mechanisms may be important for longevity, our study only considers probabilities on a population level. In the future, a genome-wide pathway-based approach (Chen et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2010) could be a useful means to explore the
