Abstract: Polymorphisms in the WRN gene have been associated with Werner Syndrome (WS), a segmental progeroid disorder with symptoms resembling premature aging. This study aimed to investigate whether polymorphisms in the WRN gene also influence aging trajectories and survival in the general population. The impact of i1-C/T, L1074F and C1367R polymorphisms on cardiovascular pathologies, cognitive performance and all-cause mortality risks were assessed in the population-based Leiden 85-plus Study. Results showed that the studied polymorphisms did not influence aging trajectories or survival in the population at large.

1. Introduction 

Werner Syndrome (WS) is a segmental progeroid disorder with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Patients with WS display symptoms resembling premature aging, including diabetes, osteoporosis, vascular diseases and high incidence of malignant neoplasms. Death usually occurs before the age of 50 years due to cancer or atherosclerosis. WS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the WRN gene. Since mutations in the WRN gene lead to accelerated aging, it has been hypothesized that polymorphisms in the WRN gene may also modulate the course of aging in the population at large and play a role in the sensitivity or resistance to the development of age-related disorders. 

Only a few studies have addressed this question, with contradictory results. Studies in Japanese have shown that a C1367R variation in the WRN gene is associated with myocardial infarction, whereas in Caucasians no associations with cardiovascular disease have been found. An i1-C/T polymorphism has been related to cognitive functioning, and for an L1074F SNP an age-dependent enrichment of the 1074L allele in Finnish and Mexican populations has been observed. These associations have been found in separate studies, and to date there are no data on the influence of the C1367R polymorphism on cognitive function and survival, and no information on the i1-C/T and L1074F polymorphisms on cardiovascular disease risks in elderly.

2. Materials and Methods 

The study was carried out in elderly participants aged 85 years and older using cross-sectional and prospective study designs. The i1-C/T (rs2725335) and C1367R (rs1346044) variations were genotyped using an Assay-by-Design (Applied Biosystems), while the L1074F (rs2725362) polymorphism was genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), using the Sequenom MassARRAYtm methodology. 

The impact of the i1-C/T, L1074F and C1367R polymorphisms on cardiovascular pathologies, cognitive performance and all-cause and cause-specific mortalities were analyzed using logistic regression models and linear mixed models.

3. Results 

Results showed that the studied polymorphisms did not influence aging trajectories or survival in the population at large. At baseline, the risks of myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, intermittent claudication, arterial surgery and stroke did not vary between the different genotypes. Also, no differences in cognitive functioning were observed, except for attention where carriers of the 1367R allele performed worse compared to the 1367C homozygotes. Mortality risks were similar between the different genotype carriers of the i1-C/T, L1074F and C1367R polymorphisms.

4. Discussion 

In conclusion, this study suggests that the i1-C/T, L1074F and C1367R polymorphisms in the WRN gene do not influence aging trajectories or survival in the population at large. These findings provide important insights into the role ofCognition during the follow-up was adjusted for sex and level of education. Mortality was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, followed by the calculation of sex-adjusted mortality risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality with the Cox proportional hazard model, using left censoring to correct for the delayed entry into the risk set according to age. For each polymorphism, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using common allele homozygotes as the referent group. All analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software, Version 12.0 (Chicago, IL, USA), except for the mortality analyses, which were performed with STATA software, Version 9.0 (TX, USA).

2. Subjects and methods

2.1. Study population

The Leiden 85-plus Study is a prospective population-based study in which inhabitants of Leiden, The Netherlands, aged 85 years or over were invited to take part. There were no selection criteria related to health or demographic characteristics. The study population consists of two cohorts: cohort 87 and 97. Cohort 87 includes 977 participants aged 85 years and older, enrolled between 1987 and 1989 (Weverling-Rijnsburger et al., 1997). Cohort 97 consists of 599 subjects, all members of the 1912-1914 birth cohort who were enrolled in the month of their 85th birthday between 1997 and 1999 (Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2002). DNA was available for 682 participants from cohort 87 and for 563 people from cohort 97. All participants of the Leiden 85-plus Study were followed for mortality until April 1, 2004. Primary causes of death were obtained from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics and categorized according to the 10th International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. In addition, 247 young blood donors (aged 19-40 years) from Leiden were included for a cross-sectional comparison of genotype frequencies. To avoid population stratification due to geographic differences between the elderly and young, we restricted the young control population to those with either two Leiden-born parents or one Leiden-born parent and the other born within a 12-km distance from Leiden. Information regarding the birthplace of their grandparents was obtained from a written questionnaire (Heijmans et al., 1999).

3. Results

All 1245 participants of the Leiden 85-plus Study and 247 young blood donors were genotyped for the i1-C/T, L1074F, and C1367R polymorphisms. The location of the SNPs in the WRN gene and protein are indicated in Fig. 1. The genotype and resulting allelic frequencies of the SNPs were in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, except for the C1367R polymorphism in cohort 97 (Table 1). In that case, a deficit of heterozygotes and an excess of both homozygote allele carriers were observed. The overall genotype distributions and resulting allelic frequencies of the SNPs were similar to those found in Caucasians (Bendixen et al., 2004; Castro et al., 1999, 2000). In this study, the calculated allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between the elderly and young subjects, showing no enrichment for any of the alleles (Table 1).

The prevalence of cardiovascular pathologies dependent on the i1-C/T, L1074F, and C1367R polymorphisms, and the influence of these SNPs on cognitive functioning were assessed only in cohort 97. At baseline, the risks of myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, intermittent claudication, arterial surgery, and stroke dependent on the i1-C/T, L1074F, and C1367R polymorphisms did not vary between the different genotypes (Table 2).

Fig. 2. Kaplan-Meier curves of cumulative all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, dependent on i1-C/T, L1074F and C1367R genotypes in the combined cohort of 1245 individuals from age 85 years onwards. 

Over the course of person-years, 957 (77%) participants had died, of which 365 (38%) died from cardiovascular disease and 143 (15%) due to cancer. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative mortality according to the genotypes of the different SNPs are presented in Fig. 2. According to the Kaplan-Meier mortality curves, it seems that carriers of the i1-CT genotype, and heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the 1367R allele have lower cancer mortality. Although not statistically significant, the mortality risk estimates of 0.56 (0.26-1.20) for i1-CT, 0.84 (0.59-1.20) for C1367R and 0.57 (0.27-1.17) for R1367R genotypes show lower cancer mortality. The same trend was observed in cohort 87 and 97 (Supplementary Table 1). The other all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks, calculated separately for all polymorphisms, were similar between the different genotype carriers of the i1-C/T, L1074F and C1367R polymorphisms, showing no evidence of altered survival.

The association between cognition and WRN gene polymorphisms has been assessed previously only in one study (Bendixen et al., 2004). In that study, the T allele of the i1-C/T SNP was associated with better cognitive functioning in the elderly, and no associations with the C1367R SNP were found (Bendixen et al., 2004). The beneficial effect of the i1-T allele was only seen on the cognitive composite score and not on MMSE. In our study, carriers of the i1-T allele seemed to perform better on all the analyzed cognitive domains; however, the differences did not reach statistical significance. A significant association, on the other hand, was observed between the C1367R polymorphism and attention. Carriers of the 1367R allele had worse attention compared to the 1367C homozygotes. The other domains of cognition seemed to be unaffected. The positive association between the C1367R SNP and attention could be a chance finding. In this study, we did not correct for multiple testing; however, if such correction had been applied, then the borderline significance would have disappeared. In order to exclude that the findings of this and the other study (Bcorrected text:
