ABSTRACT: An efficient uncoupling process is generally considered to have a protective effect on the aging muscle by slowing down its age-related decay. Genetic polymorphisms in the Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3) gene whose product is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle were suggested to be associated with hand grip (HG) performances in elderly populations. Considering the population specificity of the quality of aging, we aimed to add further support to this evidence by analyzing the association between four SNPs in the UCP3 gene and relative haplotypes in two large cohorts of middle-aged (N = 708) and oldest old Danes (N = 908). We found that the variability at rs1685354 and rs11235972 was associated with HG levels both at a single and haplotypic level in both cohorts. Furthermore, taking advantage of large cohort and period survival data of the oldest cohort, we tested the association of each SNP with survival at 10 years from the baseline visit. Interestingly, we found that allele A at rs11235972, associated in this cohort with lowest HG scores, influences also the survival patterns, with people carrying this allele showing higher mortality rates. On the whole, our work supports the role of UCP3 gene in functional status and survival at old age. or 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction: In 2003, Newman et al. reported that hand grip strength is a useful marker for identifying genes affecting mid- and late-life physical functioning. Twin studies have demonstrated that about 50% of the observed variation in hand grip strength can be explained by genetic effects (Frederiksen et al., 2002). Several associations have been reported between hand grip and the variability of genes involved in inflammatory response, myostatin signaling, neuron and bone metabolism (Roth et al., 2001; Arking et al., 2006; De Mars et al., 2007; Walsh et al., 2009; Dato et al., 2010; Windelinckx et al., 2011). Recently, Uncoupling Protein (UCP) genes have been put forward as candidate genes because of their role in energy metabolism. The Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3) gene is of particular interest since it is expressed in skeletal muscle where it regulates fatty acid metabolism, oxidative status, and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production. A previous report showed that a functional polymorphism, located in the promoter region of the UCP3 gene (rs1800849), significantly affects hand grip strength in an elderly population from southern Italy (Crocco et al., 2011), suggesting a correlation between the uncoupling process and the regulation of muscle metabolism/catabolism in the elderly. 

The reduction of muscle mass in the elderly, known as sarcopenia, becomes so significant after the fifth decade of life that it is widely studied as one of the most important markers of human aging. Furthermore, sarcopenia is regarded as one of the major contributors to frailty (Morley et al., 2001), considering that the loss of muscle mass influences metabolic adaptation, immunological response to disease, capability to respond to environmental stress (Schrager et al., 2003) and so has a relevant impact on the overall homeostasis at old age. Operatively, sarcopenia is measured through the reduction of hand grip strength which is considered a measure of the overall skeletal muscle mass observed to gradually and significantly decrease as the individual ages (Doherty, On the HG performance might finally result in differential patterns of survival of the different relevant genotypes, we evaluated survival after 10 years from the baseline visit in the 1905 Cohort by using Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models (Bradburn et al., 2003). Sex, BMI, and the four UCP3 SNPs (one SNP at a time) were considered as covariates. As reported in the paper by Dato et al. (2011), AFT models can be preferred over the more commonly used Cox regression model (Cox, 1972), particularly when, as in the case of the variable sex for the 1905 Cohort, proportional hazard assumptions are not respected (Schoenfeld, 1982, see Supplementary materials). Moreover, with respect to the less intuitive hazard function provided by Cox models, AFT models allow obtaining a clearer explanation of covariate effects by directly linking the estimation of survival time with the values of covariates: a positive regression coefficient indicates that the covariate is associated with higher survival chances; conversely, negative coefficients indicate lower survival chances. In addition, a recent study demonstrated the usefulness of AFT models also in aging research (Swindell, 2009). Then, from the fitted AFT models, sex-adjusted survival curves were obtained, analyzing each SNP independently from each other. Fitting of AFT models was carried out by assuming a Weibull distribution. Subjects alive or immigrated after 10 years from the baseline visit were considered as censored (Gaist et al., 2000).

Recruitment was started in 1998 when 2640 intact twins from 22 consecutive birth years (1931-1952) were chosen via the Danish Population Register. The sample analyzed in this study includes only one from each twin pair. Both surveys included multidimensional face-to-face interviews aimed at the collection of socio-demographic information, assessment of physical, cognitive, depressive status, sensory impairments, medications, self-reported health status, and DNA sampling. Permission to collect blood samples and usage of register-based information was granted by The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics.

Handgrip (HG) strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer (SMEDLEY's dynamometer TTM, Tokyo, Japan) while the subject was sitting with the arm close to their body. The test was repeated three times with the stronger hand; the maximum of these values was used in the analyses. When a test was not carried out, it was specified whether it was due to physical disabilities or because the subject refused to participate.

Survival analysis of UCP3 haplotypes was carried out by using AFT models as well. In particular, first, the probabilities of the individual haplotype combinations (diplotypes) were estimated by using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm implemented in the haplo.stats package of R. Second, N dummy variables, corresponding to the number of different observed haplotypes, were obtained coding the reconstructed diplotype in an additive fashion (the count of a particular haplotype in the diplotype). Finally, AFT models were used for estimating the statistical significance of each haplotype, with the EM estimated probabilities used as weights. Since this approach underestimates the standard errors of rare haplotypes, they were not included in the model when their frequency was lower than 5%. As in the previous case, sex and BMI were used as adjunctive covariates in the model.

For the analysis of UCP3 genetic variability, SNPs were chosen in the genomic region 73,387,985-73,402,778 of chromosome 11, which corresponds to the coding region of UCP3 gene plus 5000 base pairs (bp) upstream and 1000 bps downstream (NCBI B36 assembly), to take into consideration possible regulatory elements of the gene. Tagging SNPs covering as much as possible of the known common genetic variation in UCP3 were chosen by analyzing HapMap genotype SNP data in HaploView software (http://www.broadinstitu- te.org/haploview/haploview, Barrett et al., 2005). In this analysis, the following criteria were adopted: Minimum Allele Frequency (MAF) of at least 5%, pairwise tagging only, r2 â‰¥ 0.8, LOD = 3, and a minimum distance between SNPs = 60 bp. The same program has been used for obtaining the graphical overview of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) (definition of blocks based on confidence interval algorithm, as reported in Gabriel et al., 2002). Pairwise measures of LD between the analyzed loci were quantified by the correlation coefficient r2.

All statistical analyses were carried out using R statistical environment (R Development Core Team, 2010.

The analyzed phenotype (Perneger,1998). Furthermore, because this work confirmed a previous association between UCP3 variability and hand grip levels at old age, we believe that borderline and trend results should also be taken into account. Production, thus preventing or reducing the age-related decay of the aging muscle (Nabben et al.,2008; Mookerjee et al.,2010). When investigating the association of UCP3 haplotypes (consisting of the four SNPs) with HG, in line with the single locus analysis, we found that some haplotypes show different effects on HG performances in both cohorts. In particular, the haplotype AAAG was significantly associated with higher HG scores in MADT Cohort while in the sample of1905 Cohort haplotypes GAGA and GAAA were associated with lower scores and GGAG and GGGG were associated with higher scores. Both single and haplotypic associations remain significant after correction for multiple testing; therefore, they can be considered statistically robust. Accordingly, genetic variants associated with lower HG at the single-SNP level also show lower HG at the haplotypic level. Although the candidate SNPs analyzed in this study are not functional, data from the HapMap consortium report a complete LD between the functional variant rs1800849, influencing the HG strength in a southern Italian elderly population (Crocco et al., 2011), and rs11235972 (r2 = 1). A less strong LD exists between rs1800849 and the other SNPs tested (r2 = 0.5 with rs3781907, r2 = 0.23 with rs647126, r2 = 0.22 with rs1685354). Consequently, we may argue that the association observed in this work can be due to a functional linkage of our polymorphisms with rs1800849, or they could both be in LD with the actual causal variant. The observed association of rs1685354 with lower HG in middle-aged individuals and higher HG in nonagenarians could suggest a possible antagonistic pleiotropic effect of this polymorphism (or the associated causal variant) on the phenotype. In younger individuals, a more efficient uncoupling process, promoting the dissipation of proton gradient, reduces ATP level and energy availability, which may be associated with lower muscular functioning in an energy-demanding organism. On the contrary, in a different metabolic scenario, possibly characterized by a loss of muscle mass, a higher expression of uncoupling proteins may replace dysfunctional mitochondria by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, as suggested for UCP2 by Wu et al. (1999), and so represent an adaptation of the aging organism to the new physiological status. In support of this hypothesis is the evidence coming from studies on the regulation of UCP proteins, where it emerges that their activity is modified when facing different physiological and nutritional stimuli (Ricquier et al., 2000). Furthermore, the observation of a correlation between genetic variants harboring higher gene expression of UCP genes Considering the importance of sarcopenia and loss of muscle mass in the aging process, we tested the possible association of UCP3 single variants with survival in the 1905 Cohort by using AFT models. Taking advantage of the large cohort and follow-up period available in our dataset, we found that UCP3 SNPs were also associated with survival at 10 years in this cohort. Consistently with the previous association results, rs11235972, which negatively influenced HG scores, was also associated with a lower chance of survival, with rs11235972-A carriers showing higher mortality than non-carriers. A borderline significant association with survival was also observed for rs3781907, even if the variant did not show any significant association with HG levels. On the contrary, despite rs1685354 having significant effects on HG performance, no significant association was detected in terms of survival. A comparison with the classical Cox regression proportional hazard models, carried out by using each SNP and sex as covariates, confirmed these results (Table 2SM). Finally, taking into consideration the modest LDKupelian, V., Visser, M., Simonsick, E.M., Goodpaster, B.H., De Rekeneire, N., Fallin, D.M., Fried, L.P., Li, T., Beamer, B.A., Xue, Q.L., Chakravarti, A., Walston, J.

Conclusions:
Overall, our work confirms the association between UCP3 variability and muscular strength measured through handgrip, also in the Danish population. Despite the differences in handgrip performances found in nonagenarians and individuals aged 50+ across Europe (Jeune et al., 2006; Andersen-Ranberg et al., 2009), UCP3 genetic polymorphisms could be considered a common and informative target for better evaluating muscular functionality and then the quality of aging in both northern and southern European populations. Furthermore, the different associations found between UCP3 polymorphism in individuals belonging to different age ranges may be due to the fact that UCP proteins act in a complex pathway where genetic variability may also interact with several transcription/replication factors directly regulating mitochondrial metabolism involved in muscular functioning. The coordination of these factors into a program responsive to the environment is complex and may represent one of the mechanisms used by the aging organism to adapt itself to the new physiological scenario (Franceschi et al., 2000). In line with this hypothesis are recent data emphasizing the role of UCP variations on metabolic efficiency (Mookerjee et al., 2010), which underline how the impact of UCP gene variation on human longevity can be due to the coordination of their different functions rather than the sole well-known effect on oxidative stress. In any case, our work adds a piece of evidence to the hypothesis that the variability of the UCP3 gene, involved in the control of energetic metabolism, can influence survival at old age. In general, the association of UCP genetic variability with survival, if confirmed in different populations by future replication studies, suggests a crucial role of their metabolic pathway in human longevity.
