Abstract

In an exploratory study, 11 common polymorphisms were examined for contributing to longevity including: apolipoprotein E (apoE), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), cathepsin D (CAD), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), angiotensinogen (AGT) and insulin- like growth factor 2 (IGF2), Leiden factor 7, p53 oncogene, dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and the serotonin transporter (SERT). Genotype and allele frequencies of these genes were compared in 224 older (75 years) Jewish Jerusalem residents of Ashkenazi ethnicity to a group of 441 younger subjects (22 years). Nominally significant results provide suggestive evidence in the Ashkenazi group that apoE, MHTFR, SOD2, IGF2 ApaI, and factor VII are risk factors for a single outcome, survival to 75. Overall, the more genetically homogenous Ashkenazi ethnic group showed evidence for association in five genes examined suggesting that future studies in this population would gainfully focus on this ethnic group.

1. Introduction

contributing to human longevity is only now slowly being elucidated.

1.1. Genes and aging in humans

Twin and adoption studies confirm a significant genetic component to human longevity (Carmelli, 1982). An oft- quoted Danish twin study (Herskind et al., 1996) estimated the heritabilty of life span to be 0.23 for males and 0.20 for females but a more recent Swedish study attributes perhaps as much as 50% of the variation in susceptibility to mortality to genetic factors (Yashin et al., 1999). Most researchers agree that heritability of lifespan in human is modest, <50%. Moreover, the role of specific genes in

The current case-control genetic study is based on the ongoing Jerusalem Longitudinal Cohort Study (JLCS) of 70- year-old (born in 1920/21) Jewish residents of Jerusalem initiated in 1990 (Bursztyn et al., 1999; Bursztyn et al., 1996; Cohen et al., 1995; Dresner-Pollak et al., 1996; Eliakim et al., 1996; Ginsberg et al., 1999; Maaravi et al., 1996; Stessman et al., 1995; Stessman et al., 1996; Stessman et al., 2000). The younger cohort was recruited from a non- clinical population in ongoing studies of normal personality (Ebstein et al., 2000; Zohar et al., 2003) and eating behavior (Bachner-Melman et al., 2004).

1.3. Candidate genes studied

2.3. Genotyping

The SERT promoter region polymorphism was char- acterized as previously described by our laboratory (Ebstein et al., 1997). PCR amplification was carried out using the primers: SIL 1 50-ggC gTT gCC gCT CTg AAT gC-30 and SIL 2 50-gAg ggA CTg AgC Tgg AC A ACC AC-30. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 2% metaphor gel (FMC) with ethidium bromide to screen for genotypes. For the VNTR, target DNA was amplified by PCR using the specific oligonucleotide primers: 50-GTCAGTATCA- CAGGCTGCGAG-30 and 50-TGTTCCTAGTCTTACGC- CAGTG-30 according to standard procedures (Ogilvie et al., 1996). The primer pair amplifies the region of intron 2 containing the 16–17 bp repetitive element.

frequency for a number of genes that we identified as worthwhile candidates that make biological sense for contributing to human lifespan: apolipoprotein E (Blanche et al., 2001; Rea et al., 2001; Slooter et al., 2001; Smith, 2002; Wang et al., 2001a), cathepsin D (Bi et al., 2003; Payton et al., 2003), insulin-like growth factor 2 (O’Dell et al., 1997, 1999; O’Dell and Day, 1998; Offen et al., 2001), superoxide dismutase 2 (De Benedictis et al., 1998; Mitrunen et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001b), methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (Kohara et al., 2003; Mattson et al., 2002; Visscher et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2003; Zuliani et al., 2002), Leiden factor V and VII (Hessner et al., 2001), angiotensinogen (Tan et al., 2001) and p53 oncogene (Bonafe et al., 1999). Additionally, we examined two ‘lifestyle’ genes that we also hypothesized might also contribute to lifespan, the dopamine D4 receptor linked in some studies to novelty or sensation seeking and the serotonin transporter linked in some studies to anxiety and depression (Ebstein et al., 2000).

follows. PCR amplification was carried out using a Reddy Mix kit (AB gene, Surrey, UK). The primers employed were forward 50-CTT CCTACC CTG CCC GCT CAT GCT GCT GCT CTA CTGG-30, and reverse 50-ACC ACC ACC GGC AGG ACC CTC ATG GCC TTG CGC TC-30. The reaction mixture contained the following components: 0.5 mM primers, 20 ng DNA and 10% DMSO in a total volume of 10 ml. After an initial denaturation step of 94 8C for 5 min, amplification was carried out for 35 cycles (948C for 30 s, 55 8C for 30 s and 72 8C for 90 s) in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus 9600 thermal cycler. A 5 min final extension at 72 8C was employed. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel (Ameresco: Ohio, USA) with ethidium bromide to screen for genotypes.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Older subjects

Stessman and his colleagues have surveyed the social and medical conditions of this heterogeneous elderly population

medical conditions of this heterogeneous elderly population (Bursztyn et al., 1996, 1999; Cohen et al., 1995; Dresner- Pollak et al., 1996; Eliakim et al., 1996; Ginsberg et al., 1999; Maaravi et al., 1996; Stessman et al., 1995, 1996, 2000). From a representative systematic sample (from a geographically sorted electoral register) information was gathered on migration history, dwelling conditions, health status, health service utilization, employment status, activities of daily living, social support, use of drugs and war experience. Additional information was obtained from in-depth anamnesis and physical examination, as well as cognitive and psychological tests. In addition, a battery of biochemical and hematological blood tests were performed as well as urine analysis and culture, ECG and pulmonary function tests. DNA samples are available on approximately 400 of these subjects. The age of the population at the time of DNA sampling was 75 years. There were 150 males and 74 females in the older Ashkenazi group.

SNPs were assayed using an ABI SNaPshot kit and the products analyzed in an ABI 310 DNA analyzer. The primers for the first and second PCR reactions are shown below. A Reddy Mix master mix was used (Abgene, Surrey, UK) at a magnesium concentration of 1.5–2.5 mM MgCl . 2 The first PCR reaction was carried out as follows. The sample was initially heated at 95 8C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 8C (30 s), 55 8C (30 s), 72 8C (90 s) and a final extension step of 72 8C for 10 min.

2.2. Younger subjects

The younger (21.89 years, range 13–33 years) non- clinical population was recruited in ongoing studies of normal personality (Ebstein et al., 2000; Zohar et al., 2003) and eating behavior (Bachner-Melman et al., 2004). There were 121 males and 320 females in the young Ashkenazi group.

percentage of the apoE 4 allele (logistic regression: likelihood ratio = 9.236 P = 0.01, parameter estimate Wald statistic allele 2 = 5.438 P = 0.02, allele 3 = 8.628 P = 0.003; chi-square: male chi-square = 7.409, P = 0.025, 2d.f.; female chi-square = 5.453, P = 0.065, 2d.f.).

3.2. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)

There is an increase in C allele frequency (67.4% versus 55.3%) in the older Ashkenazi females (logistic regression: likelihood ratio = 6.001 P = 0.014, parameter estimate Wald statistic allele C = 5.95 P = 0.015; chi-square: male chi- square = 0.227, P = NS, 2d.f.; female chi-square = 4.76, P = 0.029, 1d.f.). There is an increase in the percentage of CC homozygotes (logistic regression: likelihood ratio = 7.33, P = 0.026; chi-square = 6.199, P = 0.045) in the older female Ashkenazi group (50% versus 30.6%).

Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)

The only significant result was an increase in the percentage of T allele (51% versus 33.3%) in older Ashkenazi male subjects (chi-square = 6.749, P = 0.009, 1d.f.) and a corresponding increase in the percentage (45.5% versus 25%) of TT homozygotes (chi-square = 6.545, P = 0.038, 2d.f.).

2.4. Statistical analysis

Comparison of allele and genotype frequencies was carried out using chi-square analysis and logistic regression as provided for in the SPSS Windows program. All polymorphisms, except for Factor V (young group), were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in both the young and old cohorts, examined separately. HWE was calculated using a convenient website: (http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/vet- gen/Popgen/genetik/applets/kitest.htm). Considering that 11 alleles were studied and that we compared controls versus an older cohort, a conservative stand would be to conclude that a difference is significant for P-values < 0.05/11 = 0.0045. Nevertheless, the P-values reported in the results were uncorrected for multiple testing.

The only significant result was decrease in the percentage (30.6% versus 19.2%) of the A allele in older Ashkenazi male subjects (chi-square = 4.027, P = 0.045, 1d.f.) and a corresponding marked decrease (9.7–2.1%) in the percen- tage of AA homozygotes (chi-square = 5.790, P = 0.055,

3.5. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) ApaI

An increase in the A allele was observed in older Ashkenazi females (chi-square = 3.455, P = 0.063) and a highly significant increase (3.8–15.7%) was observed in AA genotype in these subjects (chi-square = 10.972, P = 0.004, 2d.f.).

3. Results

years and used chi-square and logistic regression analysis to compare allele and genotype frequency for each of these candidate genes. In the chi-square analysis, results were stratified by sex whereas in the logistic regression sex was entered as a covariate. Sex was used to stratify the sample since a number of associations between common poly- morphisms and longevity appear to be gender specific (Bonafe et al., 2001; Ivanova et al., 1998; Lio et al., 2002a, 2002b, 2002c)

There was no significant association for any of the other polymorphisms examined.

Only significant findings are presented below.

As summarized in Table 1, we have examined 11 polymorphisms for association with a single outcome, survival to 75 years, by comparing a young Ashkenazi group to an older cohort. Although nominally significant associa- tions were observed it should be noted that only one is robust

when corrected for multiple testing (IGF2 ApaI). Therefore, these results should be considered only suggestive. Never- theless, since some of the observed associations are both consistent with previous investigations (for example, ApoE) and moreover, make ‘biological sense’, we believe that overall the current investigation may serve as a useful roadmap towards unraveling the complex genetic architec- ture of human longevity.

4.4. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MHTFR)

The gene coding for MHTFR has been well characterized and subjects homogenous for the TT allele at position 677 display higher levels of plasma homocysteine and are at risk for cardiovascular disease (De Bree et al., 2002). The increased frequency of the C allele in older Ashkenazi women is consistent with a deleterious effect of TT homozygosity presumably mediated by high serum homo- cysteine levels.

4.2. Apolipoprotein E

The finding that there is an increase in the apoE2 allele and a decrease in the apoE4 allele in older Ashkenazi male subjects is consistent with a large literature demonstrating the protective effect of e2 and the deleterious role of e4 in conferring risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Blanche et al., 2001; Rea et al., 2001; Slooter et al., 2001; Smith, 2002; Wang et al., 2001b).

4.5. Superoxide dismutases (SOD)

Functional polymorphisms in the genes encoding SOD, superoxide scavenging antioxidant enzymes, may play an important role in the development of a number of diseases. SOD reduces intracellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species, a by-product of cellular metabolism that can build to toxic levels if not removed. Toxic reactive oxygen levels cause intracellular damage that is hypothe- sized to be a putative cause of aging. For example, the ala/ala polymorphism of the superoxide dismutase 2 gene may be a modest risk factor for prostrate cancer (Woodson et al., 2003), sporadic breast cancer (Mitrunen and Hirvonen, 2003) and colorectal cancer (Stoehlmacher et al., 2002). In the current study, we observed an increase in the TT (val/val) homozygotes in older Ashkenazi males consistent with a deleterious role for the ala/ala genotype.

4.3. ApoE and aging—a robust finding

The finding that e4 allele becomes markedly less frequent with advancing age is one of the most robust single gene findings in the human genetic studies of ageing (Schachter et al., 1994). It is of interest that the report of Schachter et al. (1994) compared centenarians to subjects aged 20–70 years old whereas in the present study, we observe the deleterious effect of e4 already at 75 years and also the protective effect of e2. These results suggest the notion that many of the genes contributing to longevity can be detected using subjects considerably younger than centenarians. Interestingly, children of centenarians had a 56% reduced relative prevalence of heart disease (odds ratio, a 66% reduced relative prevalence of hypertension and 59% reduced relative prevalence of diabetes) after multivariate adjusted analyses (Terry et al., 2003). These findings strengthen the notion that gene variants protective for major diseases such as heart disease and diabetes seem to play a particularly important role in exceptional longevity. Moreover, their

4.6. IGF2

IGF2, also known as somatomedin A, is a single chain polypeptide which shares an amino acid sequence homology of about 47% with insulin and about 31% with relaxin and with them comprise the insulin family of polypeptide growth

2003). The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling system plays a critical role in the growth and development of many tissues and regulates overall growth, particularly prenatal growth. The IGF system has also been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions, and is thought to play a particularly prominent role in tumorigenesis. The IGF system is comprised of the IGF ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II), cell-surface receptors that mediate the biological effects of the IGFs, including the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), the IGF-II receptor (IGF-IIR), and the insulin receptor (IR), as well as a family of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBPs affect the half-lives and bioavailability of the IGFs in the circulation, in extracellular fluids, and may exert IGF-independent effects under certain conditions. Not surprisingly, consider- ing the extensive homology between these two peptides, both IGFI and IGFII activate IGF1R receptors. To our knowledge, the current report is the first directly linking a SNP in the IGF2 receptor directly to longevity, as opposed to BMI-related measures, in humans.

hormone action, stimulation of growth of cultured cells, stimulation of the action of insulin, and involvement in development and growth. They appear to be autocrine regulators of cell proliferation. Consistent with this profile of metabolic actions, an association has been reported between a SNP in the 30 untranslated region of the IGF2 gene (ApaI) and BMI (O’Dell et al., 1997) that accounts for a small percentage of the population variance. A number of studies appear to confirm this initial finding between IGF2 ApaI G allele and BMI (Gaunt et al., 2001; O’Dell et al., 1997, 1999; Rice et al., 2002; Roth et al., 2002) including suggestive evidence from a recent genome scan for obesity (Gaunt et al., 2001; O’Dell et al., 1997, 1999; Rice et al., 2002; Roth et al., 2002). The mechanism by which IGF2 affects BMI is suggested in a recent study employing a 100 day overfeeding protocol conducted with pairs of monozygotic twins (Ukkola et al., 2001). In response to caloric surplus, fasting plasma insulin and OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) increased more among the subjects with IGF2 Apa I GG than those with AA + AG in the insulin but not the glucose area. The changes were independent of changes in total fatness. The less common ApaI AA individuals also show lower serum levels of IGF2 (O’Dell et al., 1997) perhaps reflecting a role for the ApaI polymorphism in regulating transcription (Vafiadis et al., 1998). In the current study, we observed an increase in the A allele and the AA genotype in both Ashkenazi females and non-Ashkenazi males which is consistent with the findings that the AA genotype confers a slightly leaner body weight and may be preventative for developing insulin resistance and other metabolic-related diseases.

4.8. Leiden factor VII

The single current result that is not consistent with the risk profile of a polymorphism is an observed decrease in the A allele of the R353Q Leiden factor VII polymorphism in older Ashkenazi males corresponding to a reduced frequency of the QQ genotype (Gln/Gln). Wu and Tsongalis (2001) reviewed clinical studies that examined the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in coagulation and platelet factors to determine if specific genotypes are correlated with a history of arterial thrombotic diseases (acute coronary syndromes or stroke). A meta-analysis was performed and showed that the combined RQ (arg/gln) and RR (arg/arg) genotypes of factor VII R353Q were correlated to a reduced risk for CVD in 2574 patients, whereas the QQ (gln/gln)

The potential link between aging and insulin/insulin- like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling has attracted substantial attention on the basis of several pieces of evidence showing that disruption of the insulin/IGF-I- signaling cascade can significantly extend life span in diverse species, including yeast, worms, fruit flies, and rodents (Barbieri et al., 2003). Intriguingly, long-lived mutants, ranging from yeast to mice, share some important phenotypic characteristics, including reduced insulin signaling, enhanced sensitivity to insulin, and reduced IGF-I plasma levels, with reduced oxidative damage of macromolecules and increased stress resistance being the likely final common pathway of these effects. Such genetic homologies and phenotypic similarities of insulin/IGF-I pathway mutants raise the possibility that the fundamental mechanism of aging may be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals.

2003; Roberts et al., 1999), first findings for genetic studies are difficult to replicate especially across cultural and ethnic groups. Since longevity in humans is undoubtedly due to the cumulative effect of many common polymorphisms each of small effect size it is not surprising that replication is uneven except for a few genes.

Overall, some of the polymorphisms that have been associated with longevity in other studies or are associated with age-associated diseases likely to contribute to long- evity, were confirmed in the present study for a single outcome, survival to 75 years: apolipoprotein E, insulin-like growth factor 2, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, superoxide dismutase 2 and Leiden factor VII. However, none of the observed associations were observed uniformly across ethnic and gender categories. Additionally, the

Although in the current study, we examined the IGF2 receptor, it should be noted that IGF2 and IGF1 display similar physiological properties and are both components within a family of insulin-like growth factors (Le Roith,

significance levels were nominal and uncorrected for multiple testing.

Since this cohort consisted of two ethnic groups, one homogenous and the second characterized by heterogeneity, it is not surprising that a more consistent pattern of association was observed in the Ashkenazi cohort. We genotyped approximately 400 DNA samples in our older cohort. However, by stratifying this sample by ethnicity as well as gender considerable power was lost. Future studies in this population would gainfully focus solely on the more homogenous Ashkenazi ethnic group. Moreover, since it would be of considerable interest to compare simultaneously the risk for all examined polymorphisms a substantially larger population sample should be targeted.
