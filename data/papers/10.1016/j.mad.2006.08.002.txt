Abstract

Carnosine, a cytoprotective dipeptide found at very high concentrations in skeletal muscle, heart and brain, is cleaved in blood by serum carnosinase which is encoded by the CNDP1 gene. We recently found that homozygosity of a 5-leucine variant in the leader peptide of this enzyme protects diabetes mellitus patients against nephropathy. Hypothesising that the same allele could also be associated with longevity or a reduced incidence of cardiovascular problems, we examined the frequency of CNDP1 alleles in German centenarians, patients with premature coronary heart disease, and matched controls. A total of 1382 individuals was investigated. The 5-leucine allele was the most common allele in all groups investigated. There was no difference in allele or genotype frequency between centenarians and their control group, or between cardiovascular patients and their control group. The recently identified functional carnosinase variant therefore does neither contribute to longevity nor protect against coronary heart disease in our probands. In addition to the known trinucleotide repeat alleles in the CNDP1 gene, we detected a rare 8- leucine allele, a rare duplication, p.L13_V15dup, and a more common frameshift deletion, L17fsX20. Homozygosity for L17fsX20, estimated to have a prevalence of approximately 1:20,000, would be expected to cause carnosinaemia, an autosomal recessive trait with uncertain clinical relevance.

1. Introduction

life span of cultured cells (McFarland and Holliday, 1994), to increase the survival of rodents (Boldyrev and Severin, 1990) and to raise the life-span of male Drosophila flies to that of females (Yuneva et al., 2002). Hence, carnosine has been widely suggested as a naturally occurring anti-aging substance in men. In addition, a range of beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, including a protective role in ischemic heart disease, has been reported (Roberts and Zaloga, 2000). Carnosine is frequently offered as a nutritional supplement.

Carnosine (b-alanyl- -histidine), a dipeptide found at very L high concentrations in skeletal muscle, heart and brain, has been shown to have a range of antioxidant or cytoprotective properties including scavenging of free radicals, formation of complexes with transition metals and anti-glycating effects (Boldyrev, 2000). The protein has been reported to extend the

Two enzymes in humans are able to cleave carnosine: a secreted (serum) carnosinase and a non-specific dipeptidase (previously denoted tissue carnosinase). Serum carnosinase is encoded by the CNDP1 gene that acts on imidazole dipeptides including carnosine and homocarnosine. In human and higher

significant CHD (at least a 70% stenosis in one major epicardial coronary vessel) before the age of 55 years. The average age of disease onset was 48.2 years. The majority of subjects (90.3%) had undergone a coronary revascular- ization procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) and a subset of 243 individuals (66%) had suffered myocardial infarction. The patients were between 35 and 63 years of age at the time of recruitment (mean age: 54.8 years). The gender ratio in the entire sample was 63.3% males to 36.7% females. A total of 334 unrelated control individuals were included in the study who matched the CHD patients by ancestry (all Germans) and gender. The controls were drawn from the same age range as the CHD patients, with an average age of 50.0 years.

primates serum carnosinase is found at high concentrations in blood. Other species do not have a secreted CNDP1 gene product. The non-specific dipeptidase encoded by the CNDP2 gene is less active on carnosine and is found in the cytosol of many organs (Teufel et al., 2003). In blood, carnosine is rapidly metabolised and present at very low concentrations, whilst a high intracellular concentration in some organs is maintained by the absence of carnosinase activity.

Recently we found a functionally relevant trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in exon 2 of the CNDP1 gene (D18S880) that codes for a variable number of leucine residues in the leader peptide. Presence of five (as opposed to six or seven) leucines is associated with reduced serum carnosinase activity and confers a lower risk of diabetic nephropathy (Janssen et al., 2005). Considering the known cytoprotective and anti-aging effects of carnosine, we hypothesised that the same allele might also be associated with longevity and a reduced incidence of cardiovas- cular problems. We therefore assessed the frequency of CNDP1 alleles in large samples of German centenarians, coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, and appropriate control individuals.

There was no overlap between the control groups in the two cohorts. All subjects gave informed, written consent prior to participation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Schleswig- Holstein in Kiel.

2.3. Genotyping and statistical analysis

The leaderpeptidetrinucleotiderepeat polymorphismD18S880inexon2 of CNDP1 gene was genotyped on a fluorescent DNA analysis system (ABI 3100, Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) as previously described (Janssen et al., 2005). In selected samples, the exact sequence of exon 2 was determined by sequence analysis using the forward primer gtgtttggggaaggacgtag, the reverse primer tctcacccaaataccaaagg and the same equipment.

The observed differences were assessedforstatisticalsignificancebymeansofanin-houseMCMCimplementa- tion of Fisher’s exact test. Both MCMC-based procedures comprised a burn-in phase of 20,000 iterations and an evaluation phase of 500,000 iterations. Con- sidering that alleles coding for higher activity of an enzyme (such as CNDP1 alleles with 6 or more leucines) dominate over alleles coding for reduced activity (such as the CNDP1 5-leucine allele), and that the protective effect in diabetic nephropathy was mediated by the 5-leucine allele (Janssen et al., 2005), we also chose to compare the respective proportion of individuals homozygous for the 5- leucine allele between target and control groups.

2. Methods

A sample of 330 unrelated German centenarians was studied. All indivi- duals were between 100 and 110 years of age at the time of recruitment (mean age: 101.4 years). The gender ratio in this sample was 80.6% females to 19.4% males. The 368 German control subjects were between 60 and 75 years of age (mean age: 67.2 years) and matched the long-lived individuals by ancestry (all Germans), geographical origin within the country, and gender. A detailed description of the samples and the recruitment procedure has been previously published (Nebel et al., 2005).

as 350 individuals with premature coronary heart disease (CHD) and corresponding sex- and age-matched control groups. The results of the analyses in the four groups are shown in Table 1. The 5-leucine allele was the most common allele in all groups investigated. In addition to the previously reported 5-, 6- and 7-leucine alleles, we found a repeat of eight leucines on one chromosome. Furthermore, we observed an allele with a fragment length similar to the 8-leucine allele which however carried a novel duplication of three amino acids (LAV) preceding a 5-leucine repeat (p.L13_V15dup). There were 19 samples in which a shift in the peak position corresponding to the 7-leucine allele became apparent. Sequence analysis revealed that these samples contained a novel frameshift mutation L17fsX20 (c.48_49insTGCTG) caused by an insertion of five bases after the third base of the trinucleotide repeat in the reference sequence (Fig. 1). This mutation is predicted to change the amino acid sequence and to introduce a stop codon at position 36 of the amino acid chain. It is therefore expected to represent a null-allele that completely removes serum-carnosinase function. The null allele was infrequent in both the proband and the control groups, and no homozygote for this allele was observed.

precursor protein and is the only CNDP1 variant known to influence the enzyme activity in serum, with the exception of the rare null allele identified in the present study. The 5-leucine allele codes for a reduced activity of carnosinase and is thought to act as a recessive allele, with a strong functional impact only in the homozygous state. Previous studies by us (Janssen et al., 2005), independently confirmed by others (Barry Freedman, personal communication), showed that homozygosity for the 5- leucine allele protects against the development of nephropathy in diabetes mellitus. Considering the well-established cyto- protective effects of carnosine, we hypothesised that a similar beneficial effect would be likely with regard to longevity or the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, there was no significant difference between centenarians or CHD patients and their respective controls in terms of the frequency of neither the 5-leucine allele itself nor of homozygotes for it. Fisher’s exact test showed a difference in allele frequency spectrum between the longevity target and control groups which reached statistical significance (P = 0.021), owing to a higher frequency of the 7-leucine allele among centenarians. There is no conceivable biological explanation for a specific impact of this allele on the likelihood of reaching older age, and sequence analysis of the whole CNDP1 coding region did not reveal a genetic variant in linkage disequilibrium with the 7-leucine allele that could be assumed to influence carnosinase activity. The association may therefore be spurious.

Statistical analysis revealed no significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in any of the four samples (all P > 0.1). A modest difference was observed between the allele frequency spectra of the longevity target and control group (Fisher’s exact P = 0.021), but not between the two KHK samples (Fisher’s exact P = 0.241; see Table 1). There was no significant difference between the target and control groups in the frequency of the 5-leucine allele or the proportion of individuals homozygous for the 5-leucine allele.

Since breakdown of carnosine in the bloodstream is mainly determined by serum-carnosinase whereas reduced activity of this enzyme, mediated by the shorter leucine repeat in the leader peptide, is not associated with longevity, a question mark must be put over the proposed longevity effect of carnosine as a nutrition supplement. The hypothesis that carnosine has this effect is mainly based on cell culture experiments and animal models. It should be noted that there is a big difference between carnosine metabolism in higher primates, who have serum carnosinase, and in other species which lack the complete

4. Discussion

We could not confirm an association of the functional leucine-repeat variant in the serum-carnosinase protein with either longevity or coronary heart disease. This variant is

supported by the EU-funded PREDICTIONS study on the identification of risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy (FP6-2004-LIFESCIHEALTH-5).

During the course of our study, we identified three previously unobserved alleles in the CNDP1 gene. The rare 8-leucine allele is predicted to enhance protein secretion across the cell membrane and should therefore be associated with increased serum activity. The rare LAV duplication p.L13_V15dup, in contrast, may be functionally similar to the 5-leucine allele. Remarkably, we identified a novel frameshift mutation L17fsX20 that is predicted to completely abolish serum-carnosinase function. The mutation was found on 19 out of 2764 chromosomes investigated, representing a carrier frequency of approx. 1.4% in the German population. Complete absence of serum carnosine activity is thought to be the cause of carnosinaemia, a rare autosomal recessive trait with uncertain clinical relevance. No genetic analyses have yet been performed in affected individuals but it is possible that carnosinaemia is caused by homozygosity for L17fsX20 in some individuals, estimated to be found with a prevalence of approximately 1:20,000.

In conclusion, we report that the allelic variability of the serum carnosinase leader peptide is greater than previously thought. In humans, this system does not however appear to have any measurable influence on the likelihood of attaining old age or of developing coronary heart disease.
