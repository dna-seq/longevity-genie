Abstract

The frequency of the functional polymorphism, T2437C transversion (Met ! Thr), in the HSP 70-Hom gene was investigated within a healthy aged Irish population using oligonucleotide probes. The 2437T polymorphic nucleotide was observed to increase in the elderly, although not attaining statistical significance. The TT genotype was observed to be significantly increased within the Irish aged population ðp ¼ 0:03Þ; while conversely the TC genotype was significantly decreased in the aged subjects ðp ¼ 0:01Þ: These findings would support the theory that the change from a Met (non-polar and hydrophobic) residue to a Thr (polar and neutral) residue may disrupt the peptide-binding specificity of HSP 70-Hom and have an effect on its functional efficiency. One postulates that the highly significant p-value obtained for the TC genotype may infer that the presence of both the T and the C allele (heterozygosity) resulting in the generation of two different HSP 70- Hom protein species may negatively influence longevity. q 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Introduction

DNA and proteins have all been thought to be protected by HSPs. It has also been postulated that heat shock may increase the expression or the activity of antioxidant enzymes, catalase or superoxide dismutase (Polla et al., 1996). Members of the 70 kDa heat shock protein family (HSP 70) are consistently associated with defences against conditions involving oxidative stress such as ischemia, inflammation and the ageing process (Jac- quier-Sarlin et al., 1994; Plumier et al., 1995; Wheeler et al., 1995).

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of conserved proteins that are induced in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by elevated temperatures or a variety of cellular stresses. The cells reduce their overall rates of gene transcription and translation, and for a short period of time produce HSPs. HSPs act as molecular chaperones by binding to unfolded or misfolded proteins, promoting either correct refolding or proteolytic degradation (Jindal, 1996; Mathew and Mor- imoto, 1998; Soti and Csermely, 2000; Verbeke et al., 2001).

Different model systems have demonstrated that the induction of HSPs, particularly HSP 70, declines in response to heat shock with ageing, therefore rendering the organism more vulnerable to stress damage (Favatier et al., 1997; Rea et al., 2001). Transgenic studies in Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated an extension in normal lifespan when HSP 70 is overexpressed (Tatar et al., 1997; Silbermann and Tatar, 2000). Thus any polymorphism that results in the alteration of qualitative

The exact molecular targets for HSP protection from oxidative stress is still unresolved but cell membranes,

A duplicated locus of two intronless genes, HSP 70-1 and HSP 70-2, encoding two identical protein products and a third intronless gene, HSP 70-Hom, are located within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class III region (Milner and Campbell, 1990; Feige and Polla, 1994), see Fig. 1. A relatively low degree of polymorphism is reported in all three HSP 70 genes mapping to the HLA region (Milner and Campbell, 1992). The polymorphisms identified to date have been located either in the coding region (HSP 70-2 and HSP 70-Hom) or in the regulatory regions of the genes (HSP 70-1 and HSP 70-2). HSP 70-1 and HSP 70-2 are demonstrated to contain a number of polymorphic vari- ations, some of which correspond to silent mutations (Ishihara et al., 1995; Milner and Campbell, 1990). A functional polymorphism, T2437C transversion resulting in a methionine to threonine amino acid substitution, is known to occur in the HSP 70-Hom gene, which is a HSP that has been implicated to play a role in protection against oxidative stress (Favatier et al., 1997).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Subjects

One hundred control samples (59% female, 41% male with an age-range of 19–45 years) were chosen at random from the archival DNA bank of normal healthy Caucasian individuals from the Northern Ireland population. These samples were stored within the Northern Ireland Histocom- patibility and Immunogenetics Laboratory (NIHIL) of Belfast City Hospital. The study involved 129 aged consecutive samples (70% female, 30% male with an age- range of 80–97 years) from the Belfast Elderly Longitudi- nal Free-living Ageing Study (Rea et al., 2000). All samples were from healthy Caucasian individuals from the Northern Ireland population displaying no signs of age-related disorders, still living independently and approximate SENIEUR status (Ligthart et al., 1984).

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of the functional polymorphism, T2437C, in the HSP70-Hom

2.2. PCR Amplification

2.4. DNA sequence analysis

Purified PCR products (Qiagen QIAquick PCR purifi- cation kit) of a number of samples displaying homozygous profiles for each of the polymorphisms analysed were sequenced on a 373A automated DNA sequencer (Curran et al., 1996), using the amplification primers at a concentration of 3.2 picomoles per sequencing reaction. This confirmed the specificity of the amplification, and the exact location, and sequence of the polymorphic nucleotide encountered.

The oligonucleotide primers employed for the amplifica- tion of the 264 bp region of the HSP70-Hom gene were:

PCR amplification was performed in 50 ml reaction volumes containing 67 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.8; 16 mM (NH ) SO ; 1.5 mM MgCl ; 0.01%(w/v) Tween; 100 mM 4 2 4 2 of each dNTP; 0.1 mM of each primer; 1 unit Taq polymerase (Bioline UK Ltd, London, UK); 0.1–0.5 mg DNA. The following cycling conditions were employed: samples were held at 96 8C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 96 8C for 1 min, 60 8C for 30 s, 72 8C for 1 min. After the final cycle, the samples were held at 72 8C for 5 min, and then at 15 8C until removed from the PCR machine (Perkin–Elmer 9600 Thermal Cycler). Successful amplifi- cation was confirmed using gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml).

2.5. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using 2 £ 2 contin- gency tables and the chi-squared ðx2Þ test with Yate’s correction to assess whether the frequency differences observed between the aged and control group were statistically significant using the computer package ‘Micro- stat’.

3. Results

2.3. HSP 70-Hom polymorphism by SSOP

The frequency of the polymorphic nucleotide at position 2437, a T to C transversion, resulting in an amino acid substitution of methionine to threonine in the HSP 70-Hom protein, was investigated in the Irish aged population.

Amplified DNA (2 ml) was applied to a charged nylon membrane as previously reported (Middleton et al., 1995). Hybridisations, stringent washes and chemiluminescence detection of the hybridised digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled probes were carried out as recently reported (Williams et al., 1999). The DNA sequence of the probes were (polymorphic nucleotide is underlined):

The allele and genotype frequencies obtained during the course of the study are displayed in Table 1. There was an observed increase in the frequency of the variant HSP 70- Hom T allele within the aged cohort of samples (83%) in comparison to the control group (77%). This increased allele frequency was broadly maintained when the data was divided into males (86% vs 76%) and into females (82% vs 78%).

decrease in the aged females (27%) in comparison to the younger control females (44%) and these results were also reflected in the males (28% vs 44%). The TT genotype was significantly increased ðx2 ¼ 4: 672; p ¼ 0: 03Þ in the cohort of aged individuals (70%) in comparison to the younger control group (55%). This increase was confirmed when the data was analysed with respect to females (69 vs 56%) and males (72 vs 54%).

Increased expression of HSP 70-Hom or increased functionality of this chaperone protein may provide better protection against oxidative stress and prevent the accumu- lation of abnormal proteins within the cell. There appears to be an age-related decrease in the frequency of the variant HSP 70-Hom C allele, a significant increase in the HSP 70- Hom TT genotype ðp ¼ 0: 03Þ; and a significant decrease in the frequency of the HSP 70-Hom heterozygote TC genotype ðp ¼ 0: 01Þ; independent of gender. The highly significant p-value obtained for the TC genotype would suggest that the heterogeneity may play a role in affecting the lifespan of the subjects in this study. The possible presence of two isoforms of the HSP 70-Hom protein, one containing a Met residue at position 493 and the other containing a Thr residue, may decrease the functionality of this chaperone protein restricting its ability in alleviating the effects of oxidative stress.

4. Discussion

HSPs act as molecular chaperones and are induced in response to elevated temperatures and a variety of cellular stresses, including oxidative stress. Oxidative damage generates inactive or altered proteins, e.g. abnormal enzymes, which are reported to accumulate within humans as they age (Lee and Wei, 2001; Stadtman, 2001). It is proposed that following oxidative stress or heat shock the partially altered proteins expose hydrophobic regions on their surface, and it is these regions that the majority of HSPs recognise and bind to, facilitating refolding and preventing irreversible aggregation.

These results would lead one to conclude that this polymorphism, 2437T allele resulting in the Met residue, allows the HSP 70-Hom protein to function with greater efficiency than if the Thr residue is present. The distribution of the T and C alleles in the normal population is already highly skewed towards T (TT: 55%, TC: 44%, CC: 1%), suggesting that the homozygous CC is almost incompatible with life. One postulates that the presence of the Met residue results in individuals, who are less susceptible to disease, while more resistant to cellular stresses and ageing. If the polymorphic nucleotide T2437C is demonstrated to affect expression or functionality of the protein it may account for the significant association of the TT genotype (and decrease of the TC genotype) with the Irish aged population investigated in this study.

Due to the role of HSP 70 in protection against stresses, HSP 70 polymorphisms are thought to be involved in diseases or the conditions associated with an oxidant/an- tioxidant imbalance, such as inflammation, cancer and ageing. The HSP 70 family is particularly implicated in the defence against oxidative stress but virtually no studies exist aimed at correlating resistance to oxidative stress with genetically determined overexpression, or increased func- tionality, of HSP 70.

To begin to address this lack of knowledge, this study focussed on the analysis of a polymorphism of the HSP 70- Hom gene (position 2437, T ! C transition) that results in a methionine (Met) to threonine (Thr) amino acid substitution at position 493. Pociot et al., 1993 hypothesised that this alteration from a non-polar and hydrophobic Met residue to the polar and neutral Thr residue may disrupt the peptide- bindingspecificityofHSP70-Homandhaveaneffectuponits functional efficiency.

This study investigated polymorphism of the HSP 70- Hom gene located in the class III region of the HLA complex and it has also been postulated that HSPs are involved in antigen presentation and are a central link between the innate and adaptive immune responses (Arnold et al., 1995; Multhoff and Botzler, 1998; Anderson and Srivastava, 2000; Wallin et al., 2002). The genes of the class III region display strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA class I and II genes, and it is important to point out that any polymorphic association with ageing observed within the HSP genes may be a result of closely linked polymorphism elsewhere within the HLA region (Fig. 1).

III region display strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA class I and II genes, and it is important to point out that any polymorphic association with ageing observed within the HSP genes may be a result of closely linked polymorphism elsewhere within the HLA region (Fig. 1).

The polymorphic allele T, resulting in a Met residue, was observed at a non-significant decreased frequency of 77% in the control group in comparison to 83% in the cohort of aged subjects. This result suggests that an increase in the frequency of this variant HSP 70-Hom gene/protein is associated with the aged population, supporting the theory that the neutrality of the Thr residue (C allele) may affect the efficiency of the HSP 70-Hom protein in acting as a molecular chaperone by lowering the strength of the hydrophobic interactions between the chaperone and the target protein. In a proposed structural model of the peptide- binding, based on that of the HLA class I molecule, the altered amino acid at position 493 (Met to Thr) is on one of the b-sheets which forms the floor of the peptide-binding groove affecting specificity (Pociot et al., 1993).

Polymorphism of the HLA complex and the immune system has been the focus of a vast number of ageing association studies (Reviewed by Caruso et al., 2000; Caruso et al., 2001). One of the limitations in the majority of HLA studies reported to date is the number of aged individuals available of both genders, and complete back- ground histories of health or ethnicity for study participants. This is of even more importance considering that it is postulated that the two sexes follow different pathways to longevity (Franceschi et al., 2000). The relatively low numbers used in this study may be one possible factor in the lack of significant differences of the allele frequencies

between the aged and control populations, although there is a recognisable tendency of an increase of the T allele in the Irish aged population.
