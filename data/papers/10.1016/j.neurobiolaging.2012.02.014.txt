Abstract

Genetics plays a crucial role in human aging with up to 30% of those living to the mid-80s being determined by genetic variation. Survival to older ages likely entails an even greater genetic contribution. There is increasing evidence that genes implicated in age-related diseases, such as cancer and neuronal disease, play a role in affecting human life span. We have selected the 10 most promising late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) susceptibility genes identified through several recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These 10 LOAD genes (APOE, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33, CD2AP, and EPHA1) have been tested for association with human aging in our dataset (1385 samples with documented age at death [AAD], age range: 58–108 years; mean age at death: 80.2) using the most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in the previous studies. Apart from the APOE locus (rs2075650) which showed compelling evidence of association with risk on human life span (p p=! 5.27 1X | 10(cid:3)4), none of the other LOAD gene loci demonstrated significant evidence of association. In addition to examining the known LOAD genes, we carried out analyses using age at death as a quantitative trait. No genome-wide significant SNPs were discovered. Increasing sample size and statistical power will be imperative to detect genuine aging-associated variants in the future. In this report, we also discuss issues relating to the analysis of genome-wide association studies data from different centers and the bioinformatic approach required to distinguish spurious genome-wide significant signals from real SNP associations.

1. Introduction

al., 2003; Kenyon, 2010;). Genetic inactivation of the daf-2 gene (encoding the IGF-1 receptor homolog in C. elegans) increases the lifespan of C. elegans by approximately 100% (Sebastiani et al., 2009). Interestingly, there is emerging evidence that genes such as IGF-1/IGF1R (the orthologs of which play a major part in aging in animals) can play a role in human life span. Loss of function mutations in IGF1R have been found to be overrepresented in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians compared with controls (Suh et al., 2008).

Human aging is affected by both environmental and genetic factors (Cutler and Mattson, 2006). The heritability of aging is estimated to be 20%–30% to reach mid-80s estimated from twin studies. Survival to older ages likely involves an even greater genetic contribution (Herskind et al., 1996; Iachine et al., 1998; McGue et al., 1993). Fur- thermore, previous studies have shown that siblings of cen- tenarians have an approximately 4-fold higher chance of survival to their early 90s compared with siblings of indi- viduals who die at 73 years of age (Perls et al., 1998). A larger study conducted by the same group has shown an even higher increase (8–18-fold) in the “risk” of successful aging for siblings of centenarians compared with random controls (US 1900 birth cohort) (Perls et al., 2002). Evi- dence indicates strong familial aggregation toward aging.

Aging genes in humans may not only increase the span but also postpone age-related diseases. A study has indicated a significant decreased prevalence age related diseases in offspring of long-lived parents pertension by 23%, diabetes mellitus by 50%, heart by 60%, and no incidences of stroke) compared with age-matched control groups (Atzmon et al., 2004).

The molecular genetics that underlie the human aging process is complex and it is suggested that successful aging is likely due to numerous genes and environmental factors, each exerting a small effect (Kenyon, 2010; Lescai et al., 2009; Plomin et al., 2009).

Characterizing various genetic and environmental factors influencing human life span is currently one of the world’s major scientific challenges (Jylhava and Hurme, 2010). To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are one of the most widely used approaches for identifying common genetic variations associated with human diseases. It has been suggested that with increasing sample size, promising signals of association between human traits and genetic variants can be revealed (McCarthy, et al., 2008). Tan and Christensen have shown that increasing sample age from nonagenarians to centenarians further increases the power to discover variants associated with human aging (Tan et al.,

GenAge is a database of genes related to aging (genom- ics.senescence.info). To date there are over 250 genes that have been recorded by the GenAge database based on ex- tensive literature reviews. All of these genes have shown possible association with human aging (de Magalhães et al., 2009). Most of these genes play critical parts in a variety of biological pathways in humans, and a significant number of these genes ((cid:5) 100) are related to severe human diseases. It is generally believed that genes and biomarkers implicated in age-related diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have a role in successful aging (Panza et al., 2009). Identification of genuine aging genes may uncover “master genes” that increase our understanding of many age-related diseases.

The aim of this study was to (1) investigate whether the “known” late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) genes play a role in human aging. This could address the question if these genes are directly associated with AD or indirectly by allowing successful aging; and (2) search for candidate genetic risk factors associated with human survival and aging, which may merit further study.

There are a number of biological pathways that have been reported important in human aging, including lipid/cholesterol metabolism [GO:0006629; GO:0008203] (APOE, PON1, CETP) (Barzilai et al., 2003; de Chaves and Narayanaswami, 2008; Efrat and Aviram, 2010), immune system processes [GO:0002376] (IL6 and IL10) (Jylhävä and Hurme, 2009), drug metabolism [KEGG:hsa00982] (GSTT1) (Glatt et al., 2007; Taioli et al., 2001), energy metabolism in mitochondria (SIRT3) (Polito et al., 2010), and insulin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008286] (IGF1R, FOXO3A, KLOTHO) (Arking et al., 2005; Suh et al., 2008; Willcox et al., 2008).

2. Methods

Through collaborative efforts, we were able to draw on combined sample GWAS datasets and analyze subject-level genotype data from 1385 subjects (1047 LOAD cases and 338 controls) with documented age at death (AAD) (Table 1). The AAD histogram follows a normal distribution (Fig.  1), with mean AAD of 80.2 years of age (SD 8.9 years). All of these data were subject to subsequent quality control (QC) procedures and analysis. The data analysis was per- formed using PLINK software package (pngu.mgh.harvard. /~p edu/ purcell/plink) release 1.06 (Purcell et al., 2007).

Insights into human aging have been gained from study- ing model organisms. Extension of lifespan can be achieved by manipulating a few genes in laboratory animals, such as flies, worms, and mice (Kenyon, 2010). The insulin/insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway has a well- established role in influencing lifespan within model organ-

QC procedures were undertaken for the merged data to account for population stratification and differences in the Illumina chip versions. Data merging and QC procedures are illustrated in Fig. 2. The merged data were separated into 2 GWAS datasets (“A” and “B”) using the “--geno 0.05” command in PLINK.

For both of the GWAS datasets, the following QC pro- cedures were carried out in order.

).

EIGENSTRAT was used to calculate the genomic con- Qa. trol inflation factor ( ). This was performed iteratively using the GWAS dataset “A” with AAD including between

Only 2 centers (Mayo and NIMH) showed signif- icant differences in AAD range compared with the rest of the data. Therefore, we carried out 2 logistic regression tests using the WashU data as a control and the Mayo and NIMH data as cases. The test incorporated the top 6 PC (described previously) and AAD as covariates. For each comparison, a Q-Q plot of (cid:2)2 of observed versus expected p values was generated using “estlambda” function in GenABEL (version 1.6.4) (Fig. 4) (Aulchenko et al., 2007).

2.2. Quantitative trait analysis

Ten known LOAD susceptibility genes (APOE, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33, CD2AP, and EPHA1) were tested for association with human aging using the most significant SNPs found in the previous GWAS (Table 2). The best proxy (with the highest LD; using HapMap data) was used to inform the effect of SNPs if they were not present in our data.

Quantitative trait (QT) analysis of all SNPs was per- formed using multivariable linear regression (--linear) ad- justed for AD status, gender, and the top 6 PC. AAD was used as a continuous trait in this analysis thus giving max- imum statistical power. Manhattan plots were drawn using

The threshold for genome-wide significance (p pa 1.04 LX | 10(cid:3)7) and p value threshold (p   5 5X | 10(cid:3)5) are indicated by the horizontal lines. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between these thresholds show “suggestive” associations. The 5 SNPs (highlighted by circles) exhibit significant differences in allele frequencies between samples from Mayo and Washington University (WashU) (see Fig. 4). Two of the 5 SNPs (rs4110518 and rs2944476) showed spurious genome-wide significant signals as a result of this bias.

 LOAD cases (mean AAD 81.63 years) and controls (mean AAD AH 76.09 years), and similarly between male (mean AAD  77.93 years) and female (mean AAD  82.17 years). Anaysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the variance of AAD between the groups (LOAD cases vs. controls and male vs. female) were found to be significant (p << ( 0.001). This confirmed that AD status and gender were appropriate covariates.

This included 14 samples from the Mayo data, 1 from NIMH, and 1 from Belfast. The mean AAD in the pooled dataset (post QC) was greater than 80 years of age

The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot showed 3 dis- tinct clusters. As expected each cluster represents different population ancestry—CEU, middle right; CHB/JPT, bottom left; and YRI, top left (Fig. 7). UK, USA, and HapMap_ CEU samples formed a single cluster. On closer inspection, slight deviation between UK and USA samples exists and this was accounted for by including PCs as covariates.

After stringent QC, there were 1364 samples (1031 LOAD cases and 333 controls, 608 male and 756 female) and 528,430 SNPs remaining for further analysis.

3.2. Analysis and results

Genomic control inflation factor ((cid:1) ) was calculated using EIGENSTRAT by iteratively including 0 to 10 PC (Price et al., 2006). We found that including 6 PC generated the lowest genomic control inflation factor ((cid:1)  1.003).

Assessment of the 10 LOAD susceptibility genes yielded compelling evidence of association of APOE locus   (rs2075650) with human aging (uncorrected p 5.27 10(cid:3)4), which withstood multiple testing after Bonferroni correction for 10 independent tests (Table 3A).

Fig. 6. Minor allele frequency (MAF) analysis for 10 late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) genes with respect to aging. The figure shows the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MAFs and human aging, where age at death (AAD) is separated into 5 categories. Each AAD category contains roughly equal amounts of samples to avoid bias in sample sizes. All 10 known LOAD genes are shown together with the APOE locus highlighted in bold (all other loci in gray). The APOE locus (rs2075650) showed significant association with aging, with MAF   0.27, AAD — 89 years of age (n  1136), and MAF  0.21, AAD >t 89 years of age (n  228). None of the other gene loci were significantly associated with aging.

In addition to examining the association of these 10 LOAD susceptibility genes with aging, we performed a genome-wide analysis which includes all SNPs on the Illu- mina platforms after QC. The genome-wide significance threshold was calculated (p  1.04  10(cid:3)7) using Bonfer-  roni correction for the number of independent tests (n 483,066), which was estimated using the method we have previously described (Shi et al., 2010).

There were 41 SNPs with p value IA 5  10(cid:3)5. These SNPs span the genome, representing 35 distinct signals (pairwise r2 ,— 0.8) across 13 chromosomes. Twenty-four of them are located within 20 kilobase (kb) of known human genes with a wide range of functions. SNPs with p values “— &  5 xX 10(cid:3)5 are shown in Table 3B. These signals are at best tentative but may merit study in larger sample sets.

Without conducting logistic regression comparison, ini- tial analysis of the association study suggested 2 genome- wide significant SNPs—rs4110518 (p fg 5.96 xX 10(cid:3)9) and

No variants appear to be associated with aging with a genome-wide level of significance (p  1.04 Ae 10(cid:3)7).

(B) Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs number [major/minor allele]) from our analysis with p values s<s 5 5 xX | 10(cid:3)5. Chromosome number (CHR), base pair position (BP), and gene name is shown together with p value and direction of effect: “(cid:4)” indicates the minor allele of any given SNP is protective, whereas “(cid:3)” means the minor allele of the SNP has a detrimental effect on aging. In (B), the gene name is shown if the SNP is within 20 kilobase of a known gene.

rs2944476 (p 2.19 Comparing SNPs between NIMH and WashU data showed no significant difference in allele frequency, whereas 5 SNPs showed significant difference in allele frequency comparing Mayo data with

for the major allele “A”. No effect was seen for the  viduals carrying “AG” genotype (p 0.891).

It is perhaps unsurprising that the 2 SNPs which showed genome-wide level of significance overlap with the 5 SNPs that showed significant bias between Mayo and WashU data, as the AAD of the Mayo data are significantly younger (as previously described). It is not possible to correct for center, as the spread of the AAD is considered crucial in detecting genuine aging-associated variants. The difference in allele frequency due to samples with young AAD in Mayo and old AAD in WashU may well represent genuine associations. Including center as a covariate would abolish our ability to detect this effect.

APOE has been extensively examined with respect to human aging due to its role in AD and vascular disease. A longitudinal study following subjects for 18 years using 1094 individuals aged 75 and older showed that the risk of mortality was affected by the APOE gene. Risk was in- creased by 22% in those carrying the APOE &4 4 allele, decreased by 28% in those carrying the APOE ; €2 2 allele, and individuals carrying APOE  3 allele showed no significant difference in risk (Lewis and Brunner, 2004; Rosvall et al., 2009). The association between the APOE i i€2 2 variant and aging has been investigated in Finish centenarians, where a trend of association was observed—9%, 21%, and 25% in people aged 100 to 101, 102 to 103, and 104 years and older, respectively (Frisoni et al., 2001). SNP rs2075650 is '€4 known to be in tight LD with the APOE 4 allele (Yu et al., 2007). The direction of the effect of this SNP in our study  is compatible with previous findings for the APOE 4 allele (Christensen et al., 2006). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a major transporter of cholesterol and has been implicated in multiple age-related diseases including LOAD and vascular diseases (Panza et al., 2007).

The Manhattan plot shown in Fig. 5 represented a sce- nario before removal of these 5 false positive SNPs.

3.3. Power calculation

Power calculations indicate that a sample size approxi- mately between 3000 and 15,000 is required in order to have 80% power to detect an association with a MAF ranging above 0.05. Approximately 4000 to 19,000 samples will be needed if 95% power is required.

This estimation should be interpreted with caution as it is based on a number of assumptions (such as effect size and mode of inheritance), and gene-environment interaction 3 XE (G E) has not been taken into account.

We observed no evidence of association with the remain- ing LOAD genes implying that these genes are genuine LOAD genes with no detectable effects on human aging. However we cannot rule out the possibility that these genes may have a weak effect on aging that our dataset was not sufficiently large enough to detect.

4. Discussion

It is known that advancing age is one of the biggest risk factors for LOAD. The prevalence of LOAD has been estimated ranging from 0.6% in persons aged 65 to 69 years to 22.2% in persons aged 90 and older (Lobo et al., 2000). Because age is one of the biggest risk factors for LOAD, it is important to understand whether genes involved in LOAD play a role in successful aging.

We subsequently analyzed all SNPs on the Illumina chips after stringent QC procedures. The mean AAD for the samples analyzed was older than 80 years. This minimized the possibility of early death (prior to age 40 years) as a result of underlying nongenetic factors or highly penetrant genetic factors affecting our analysis (McGue et al., 1993).

In an assessment of all SNPs on the chip, none were found to approach genome-wide significance as calculated for this study (p y< 1.04  10(cid:3)7). The inability to detect any novel aging associated variants is likely the result of a lack of power. The calculation of power using QUANTO (ver- sion 1.2.4) has suggested a much larger sample size is required in order to detect an association with common variants. With rare exceptions, common variants are known to exert only small to moderate effects, according to previ- ous studies of many complex disorders and traits (Bodmer and Bonilla, 2008). Presenting our data on genes that lie between 10(cid:3)5 and 10(cid:3)8, while not making genome wide significance, may enable groups to identify genes for future study especially if there is overlap with other studies. Ad- ditionally these data could be used as part of a larger meta-analysis.

In this study, we have performed an association test of the top GWAS LOAD genes (APOE, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33, CD2AP, and EPHA1) with human aging using the most significant SNPs found in previ- ous studies. Apart from the well-documented association be- tween APOE and LOAD, the association with the other 9 genes was identified recently through large GWAS, each with a sample size of over 10,000 (Harold et al., 2009; Hollingworth et al., 2011; Lambert et al., 2009; Naj et al., 2011).

The results of our analysis provided compelling evidence of association between APOE locus (rs2075650) and human aging (p  5.27 xX 10(cid:3)4) (Table 3A) with risk effect based on the analysis of 1364 samples using AAD as a continuous trait. The minor allele frequency plot (Fig. 6) shows that the MAF of this SNP significantly decreases in the old AAD category (MAF  0.21; AAD ov> 89 years of age; n  228) compared with the other 4 younger AAD categories (MAF   0.27; AAD )=i 89; n   1136). Individuals homozy- gous for the minor allele “G” showed significantly lowered   AAD (p 0.002) compared with individuals homozygous

GWAS provide a method of identifying common genetic variations associated with disease or phenotype in an unbi- ased manner. However, it comes with a price of multiple testing given that many thousands of SNPs are tested si-

multaneously, and a very stringent significance threshold (p  5  10(cid:3)8) is often used to infer a genome-wide significant association and to avoid a large number of false positives (Bertram and Tanzi, 2008).

factors associated with aging. We have addressed this by correcting for AD status. However, it is possible that APOE association with age in the AD group could be due to its involvement in duration and severity of AD (Dal Forno et al., 2002). We do not however have clinical pathological features for these samples, and therefore cannot explore these endophenotypes.

We have conducted an analysis using AAD as a quan- titative trait; this is believed to provide more power compared with the traditional case/control approach. The advantage of statistical power gained compared with the case/control analysis is dependent upon the design of the study. For example, dichotomizing the AAD distribution into cases and controls would give less power than com- paring the low and high extremes of the quantitative trait (Plomin et al., 2009). Increasing statistical power by including more samples is imperative to elucidate genu- ine genetic associations in our study. Including more samples with the extreme phenotypes (e.g., exceptional longevity—nonagenarian and centenarians) would give more power than addition of samples of average AAD (Plomin et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2010).

Considering that “pure controls” where individuals die without experiencing any age-related diseases probably do not exist, we considered it valid to undertake an analysis using both sets. However, due to the large number of AD cases that have been used relative to the number of controls (about three-quarters of the total), any association with human aging implicated in the study may be biased and specific to the AD population. We acknowledge this as a limitation. However, using just the control population would result in insufficient numbers for a valid analysis. Follow-up studies using only control samples will be re- quired to confirm these associations.

Domestic and international collaborations are often re- quired to raise sufficiently large sample sizes in order to have adequate power to detect genuine disease associations. This is especially true for SNPs with a small effect size. However, such combined analysis can in some instances generate new problems. For instance, interchip and interco- hort differences could create spurious genome-wide signif- icant associations. More importantly, these SNPs may pass all conventional QC filtering (e.g., Hardy-Weinberg equi- librium p value, minor allele frequency, and genotyping rate threshold) increasing the likelihood of generating false pos- itive results, which are not corrected for by principal com- ponent analysis.

As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, ignoring comparison of data from different centers (Mayo and WashU) would give spu-  rious genome-wide significant associations (rs4110518, p 5.96 Ooy X 10(cid:3)9 and rs2944476, p  2.19  10(cid:3)8). Therefore, an extra caution should be made when performing GWAS analysis which utilizes data from multiple centers.

Including center as a covariate has been widely used to solve such problems raised by centers and this is largely effective. However this is not always possible, especially in circumstances where the number of cases and controls are significantly different between centers. In our study, cor- recting for center was not possible due to the AAD bias in centers sampled. The overall spread of AAD is crucial to our analysis and the difference in allele frequency between individuals with relatively young AAD (Mayo) and rela- tively old (WashU) may well represent genuine associa- tions.

Furthermore, we have employed samples from both LOAD cases and controls in this study which is intended to achieve maximum power to detect novel aging-associated variants. Ideally this test is better performed using only control samples, as the AD group is likely to be affected by different environmental and genetic factors in addition to
