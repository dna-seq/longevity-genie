Abstract

In a previous study on Sicilian men, an association of the functional polymorphism Asp299Gly in the TLR4 gene was reported with longevity and a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Here, we sought to confirm the findings in our extensive collection of 273 long-lived men (95–107 years), 606 male early-onset MI patients and 594 appropriate controls from Germany. Despite sufficient statistical power to replicate the findings observed in the South Italians, our results rule out a noteworthy influence of the TLR4 polymorphism upon human longevity or MI in German men. Therefore, the previously described associations in Sicilians might reflect either population-specific or potentially false-positive results. # 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in the activation of innate immunity, and TLR4-dependent pro-inflammatory signalling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations, such as myocardial infarction (MI; Edfeldt et al., 2002). Hence several studies have investigated the association of the functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +896 A/G (Asp299Gly) in the TLR4 gene with the risk of MI in Europeans, albeit with conflicting results. In some studies, the minor G allele was shown to be associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerosis and acute coronary events (Kiechl et al., 2002; Ameziane et al., 2003), in others it was found to predispose to MI (Edfeldt et al., 2004) or not to be associated at all with the disease (Morange et al., 2004; Zee et al., 2005; Koch et al., 2006). As MI is a leading cause of death worldwide and is tightly correlated with life expectancy, Asp299Gly has also been tested for association with longevity (Balistreri et al., 2004). In Sicilian men, the G allele was reported as an age-associated marker, being

significantly over-represented in 55 long-lived individuals (LLI) compared to 127 younger controls or 105 MI patients, respectively, reflecting a survival advantage for carriers of the SNP (Balistreri et al., 2004). In the present study, we sought to replicate the findings observed in the South Italians in our extensive collection of 544 long-lived German men and younger controls. In addition, we evaluated whether this SNP was also associated with early-onset MI in Germany using a sample of 929 male patients and healthy controls.

In this study, DNA samples of 1473 German men drawn from population-based collections were analyzed: 273 LLI (mean age: 97.9 years, range: 95–107 years) and 271 younger controls (mean age: 67.4 years; range 60–75 years; Nebel et al., 2005) as well as 606 MI patients (mean age: 54 years; range: 37–71 years, mean age of disease onset: 48 years; El Mokhtari et al., 2006) and 323 healthy controls (mean age: 62 years; range: 48–77 years; Krawczak et al., 2006) who showed no signs of any cardiac disease. SNP Asp299Gly (rs4986790) was 1 genotyped by a TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Logistic regression analysis was performed within the R statistical environment, version 2.3.1 to allow for adjustment of known MI confounding factors

Our study highlights a common problem of case–control association studies, i.e. the lack of reproducibility. In order to prove the validity of association results, confirmation in independent and larger samples is mandatory. This requirement is even more important for findings that are derived from underpowered studies where the sizes of the samples and of the predicted effects are small (as in Balistreri et al., 2004). In such a setting, the generated research claims are likely to suffer from type-1 errors. Another problem (e.g. for meta-analysis) is a reporting bias, with negative or ‘‘null’’ results having a publication disadvantage over positive ones. Correcting past false claims is as important as producing new scientific discoveries (Ioannidis, 2005). But often research papers that refute a previous finding are declined by the journal that printed the original article. In order to minimize the problem of selective reporting, a procedure which ensures that null results and refutations are published should be adopted by journals, as already proposed by Ioannidis (2006). This practice would provide a more accurate and balanced view of all the obtained research evidence.

Assuming a G allele frequency of 0.059 in the controls and allelic odds ratio characteristics of the Sicilian samples (Balistreri et al., 2004), our study would have had a power of (cid:2)80% to replicate the reported findings. However, in our collections, there was no evidence for an association between Asp299Gly and either longevity or MI (the latter comparison was performed after adjustment for the five major cardiac risk factors; Table 1). Also the comparison of the LLI, who had no clinically relevant atherosclerosis in their lives, with the MI patients revealed no significant association (Table 1).

In a previous study on Sicilian men, Asp299Gly (+896 A ! G) was reported to be associated with longevity. A statistically significant increase in the frequency of the minor G allele was observed in 55 LLI (14.6%) compared to 127 younger controls (5.9%) and to 105 MI patients (2.4%), respectively, indicating a survival advantage and a decreased risk of MI for carriers of the SNP (Balistreri et al., 2004). This finding is consistent with those reported by Kiechl et al. (2002), who initially described the association of the Asp299Gly polymorphism with a decreased risk of carotid and femoral artery atherosclerosis, and by Ameziane et al. (2003) showing association with a reduced risk of coronary syndrome. However, data from our extensive samples suggest that this polymorphism exhibits no significant influence on the ability of attaining exceptional old age and is not associated with a reduced risk of MI in German men (Table 1). In particular, there is no trend towards a lower G frequency in German MI patients, as suggested by the South Italian samples. Our finding is in very good agreement with several investigations, including a recent large-scale study that also observed a lack of association between Asp299Gly and MI in 2772 male German patients (Morange et al., 2004; Zee et al., 2005; Koch et al., 2006). Therefore, the previously reported associations in Sicilians might reflect either population-specific or potentially false- positive results; the latter could be caused by the very small sample sizes examined (Balistreri et al., 2004) in combination with the low frequency of the studied SNP. To demonstrate a population-specific association of this polymorphism with longevity or MI, replications with more extensive DNA collectives of Sicilian origin will be necessary.
