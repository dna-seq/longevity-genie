Background. Genetic analysis of human longevity may be useful for the understanding of molecular mechanisms implicated in age-related diseases. The molecular genetics of hu- man longevity is largely unexplored in Latin American populations and other developing countries.

Methods. To explore the possibility of an association of common polymorphisms in two candidate genes and longevity in Colombia, we analyzed two polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E (APOE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genes in a sample of 538 Colombian subjects (18–106 years), using previoulsy validated PCR-based meth-

Results. We found a significant decrease in ACE DD genotype (24 vs. 16%) between young and old subject groups (mean age: 45 vs. 77 years) ( p 5 0.03). The ACE DD genotype and D allele decrease was significant only in women. There were no differences for APOE polymorphism between young and old subjects.

Conclusions. Our results are compatible with the expected age-related decrease of ACE DD genotype. Future studies examining functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ACE gene and its correlation with serum ACE activity in the older subjects and their younger relatives in this sample are warranted.   2006 IMSS.

Introduction

pend on the genetic background and may interact with en- vironmental features (4,5); it is expected that for a complex phenotype such as human longevity, non-lineal effects of specific genetic variants can be found (2). Although life expectancy is also increasing in developing countries hav- ing profound effects on health and social dimensions (life expectancy in Colombia is |70 years, in comparison, in countries such as Mozambique, Africa and Japan, Asia, it is about 37 and 81 years, respectively) (6), the molecular genetics of human longevity is largely unexplored in Latin America and other developing regions.

Genetic explorations of human longevity may shed light on molecular factors associated with resistance to several com- mon age-related diseases (1,2). The heritability of human longevity is estimated at |20–30%, although it varies in different ethnic groups and levels of longevity (3). It has been postulated that the effects of specific candidate gene polymorphisms on different human phenotypes may de-

(11). The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee.

Laboratory Procedures

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the salting out method as described (12). Two ml of DNA solution (100–200 ng) was used for each PCR amplification reaction in a 25 ml final volume using 20 pmol of each primer, 200 mM of dNTPs and 0.6–0.75 U of Taq polymer- ase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a PTC100 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA).

APOE gene is localized in chromosome 19q (4 kb), cod- ing for a mature protein of 299 aminoacids, which has a key role in lipid transport and neural repair and plasticity (8). Two common SNPs lead to changes in positions 112 (nt 3937 T/C) and 158 (nt 4075 C/T) of the protein and produce the three classic APOE haplotypes: E2 (Cys112/ Cys158), E3 (Cys112/Arg158) and E4 (Arg112/Arg158), which have clear functional and differential effects on cell function and risk for some neurodegenerative and cardio- vascular diseases (8,9). ACE gene is localized in chromo- some 17q (20.5 kb), coding for a mature protein of 1306 aminoacids, which has a key role in bioactive peptides deg- radation and cardiovascular and neuronal homeostasis (7). A common insertion/deletion (I/D, an Alu insertion) poly- morphism in intron 16 of the gene with varying population frequencies around the world (10) has been described. In addition, particular genotypes in the ACE gene have been correlated with serum levels of the enzyme and associated with vascular (DD for myocardial infarction) and neurolog- ical disorders (II for Alzheimer’s disease) (7,10).

APOE (e2, e3 and e4 haplotypes corresponding to vari- in positions 3937 T/C and 4075 C/T of the gene) and (I/D in the intron 16 of the gene) polymorphisms were as previously described (13,17). In brief, for PCR amplification was carried out with primers 50 GCT TGG CAC GGC TGT CCA AGG A 30 and GAA TTC GCC CCG GCC TGG TAC AC 30, to am- a 244-bp fragment that was digested with HhaI restric- enzyme (Promega), run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel stained with silver nitrate; APOE genotypes were based on RFLP band combinations, as described (22: 91 and 83 bp; 23: 91, 83 and 48 bp; 24: 83 and 72 bp; 33: 91 and 48 bp; 34: 91 and 72 bp; 72 and 48 bp) (13). For ACE, PCR amplification was out with external primers to the polymorphic Alu 50 CTG GAG ACC ACT CCC ATC CTT TCT and 50 GAT GTG GCC ATC ACA TTC GTC AGA T to amplify 490/190 bp fragments (I/D allele) that were on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide Previous articles have reported a misgenotyping of ID heterozygotes as false ACE DD homozygotes using the external primers. To avoid false ACE DD ho- an additional combination of primers: (50 TGG CAC AGC GCC CGC CAC TAC 30 and 50 TCG CCA CTC CCA TGC CCA TAA T 30) (one primer a sequence in the Alu region) were used for an PCR amplification in DD homozygotes; a spe- 335-bp band was seen only in I allele carriers (on a 2% gel stained with ethidium bromide).

In this study we have analyzed the two common poly- morphisms in APOE and ACE genes in a large sample of Colombian subjects of different ages, to explore the possi- bility that they may be associated with human longevity in this population.

Subjects and Methods

Five hundred thirty eight unrelated subjects (372 women, 69.1%) of different ages (18–106 years) were recruited in Bogota´, the capital city of Colombia (for ACE polymor- phism, a subsample of 406 subjects was analyzed, 18–90 years, 70% women). The differences in the number of sam- ples analyzed for APOE and ACE polymorphisms were due to DNA storage problems of the first recruited samples, which were analyzed for APOE gene but could not be stud- ied for ACE polymorphism (due to DNA degradation). Group of older subjects was recruited in an ongoing popu- lation-based study of genetic factors associated with mental health in three neighborhoods in Bogota´; it was also com- posed of non-demented older subjects participating in ge- netic studies of cognitive impairment in a memory clinic in Bogota´ and by subjects selected in Bogota´ by their high longevity (O85 years). Group of young subjects was composed of university students and subjects participating as volunteers for the genetic analysis of human longevity. Older and younger subjects were functionally independent and living in the community. Each subject signed an in- formed consent, following international recommendations

Statistical Analysis

Genotype and allele frequencies were calculated using direct gene counting methods and the significance of the differ- ences between age groups (the overall sample was divided into two subgroups using the median age as a cut-off point) were evaluated using c2 and Fisher’s tests, with an alpha level of 0.05 (one-sided p value). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of genotype frequencies in all subject groups was evaluated. Analysis was also carried out in subgroups stratificated by sex. Statistical analysis of gene frequencies was done with Graphpad Instat program. Structure program was used as described (18) to analyze the presence of stratification in the sample of older subjects in an exploratory fashion.

Results

Genotype frequencies for APOE and ACE polymorphisms in all samples were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( p O0.05). When the 538 subjects genotyped for APOE were divided into two subgroups of older and younger subjects (mean age: 40 vs. 77 years), there were no significant differences in the distribution of allele or genotype frequencies for APOE polymorphism (Table 1) ( p O0.05). Stratification by sex did not show any significant difference for APOE genotype or allele frequencies between older and younger subjects (data not shown, p O0.05).

A significant decrease of the ACE DD genotype (24 vs. 16%, p 5 0.03) was found between subgroups of older and younger subjects (mean age: 45 vs. 77 years) (Table 2; Fig- ure 1). Stratification by sex demonstrated that the ACE DD genotype and D allele significantly decreased with age in women (25 vs. 15% –34 vs. 23 subjects, p 5 0.03 and 50 vs. 42% p 5 0.03, respectively) but not in men (19 vs. 15%–8 vs. 11 subjects, p 5 0.36 and 41 vs. 42%, p 5 0.47, respectively). APOE and ACE genotypes combina- tions did not show significant differences between younger and older subjects (data not shown, p O0.05). An explor- atory analysis of the subsample of older subjects (208 indi- viduals) using five polymorphic autosomal loci and carried out with the Structure program did not show evidence of significant sample stratification (data not shown).

ical interest may be dependent on genetic background and environmental features (4,5). A study in New York analyz- ing subjects of European, African and Latin American descent showed differential values of heritability among these populations (3).

Colombia is one of the countries where human aging is expected to have a greater impact in the world; the life expectancy in 1930 in Colombia was 40.7 years and is estimated to be 74 years in 2015 (6,19). As opposed to de- veloped countries, Colombian population has particular and differential genetic features (the population living in Bogo- ta´ has an admixture of Caucasian and Native American ge- netic backgrounds) (20) and environmental characteristics (such as education, diet, occupation, health services use, among others). Therefore, an analysis of candidate genetic polymorphisms for human longevity in the Colombian pop- ulation is of interest. In the current work we have not found significant differences in the frequency of APOE polymor- phism (allele or genotype) between different age groups in a large Colombian sample (538 subjects). We found a signif- icant decrease in the frequency of the ACE DD genotype in the older group sample compared to the younger sample (24

Discussion

Although the exploration of genetic factors involved in the mechanisms of human aging through association studies have received increasing support (2,7), the majority of genetic association studies of human longevity have been performed in North America, Europe and Asia. It has been proposed that the expression of human phenotypes of med-

vs. 16%). This decrease in ACE DD genotype as well as in the D allele was more evident in women. A lack of statisti- cal power due to the smaller size of the subsample of men may be an explanation for our failure to detect an associa- tion of ACE DD and longevity in male subjects in this sam- ple. It is important to highlight that sex-dependent genetic associations with human longevity have been reported with several polymorphisms (7). Preliminary data from an ongo- ing analysis of selected demographic and environmental variables for a subset of the sample of older subjects (206 individuals) showed higher values for BMI and serum total cholesterol and lower rates of smoking in women (unpub- lished results). Consistent with these demographic variables and a non-lineal effect of specific polymorphisms on human longevity, there is the possibility that other unknown envi- ronmental and genetic variables accounted for the earlier death of men (in comparison to women) in this sample, and that the interaction of specific genetic variants (ACE DD genotype) with some female-specific environmental characteristics found in this population (higher serum cho- lesterol, for example) may account for a earlier death of ACE DD carriers and the decreased frequency of this geno- type seen in older women in this study. The mean age of the older subjects (77 years) corresponded to |30 years more than the estimated life expectancy of their birth year cohort (40.7 years) (19).

Previously, we found a higly significant association in our population between several SNPs in the APOE gene and Alzheimer‘s disease (16,37), but not with ACE or A2M genes (17).

A future analysis in the present population of other promising candidate genes for human longevity (MTP, WRN, among others) (2,38), together with the analysis of additional SNPs in the ACE I gene having a possible func- tional effect (39) and analysis of ACE serum levels (26) in older subjects and their younger relatives (40) will be important.

Several previous association studies carried out in Cau- casian and Asian populations have shown contradictory re- sults in relation to the role of APOE and ACE polymorphisms in human longevity. In addition to varia- tions in genetic risks between populations, differences in the composition of younger and older subject samples (for example, presence of comorbidity) between studies may partially explain the variability in their results (2,7).

phisms in human longevity in Caucasian and Asian popula- tions. A systematic review showed that the association of APOE with longevity is dependent on the frequency of APOE4 in young subjects, being lower or nonsignificant in samples with a low APOE4 frequency (21,22). These observations and the low frequency of APOE4 in our young population (9%) may explain our current findings of lack of association with APOE4.

Although previous reports in Europe and Asia showed that there were no differences in ACE genotypes with age or a paradoxical decrease in ACE II genotype (23–33), a re- cent report showed a decrease of ACE DD genotype (34) (O60 vs. O70 years, 45 vs. 42%) in a smaller sample of older subjects of mixed descent living in Brazil. The age-dependent decrease and negative selection of ACE DD genotype carriers is compatible with its associated risk for cardiovascular diseases in Caucasian populations (10). Results of prospective studies analyzing mortality in small time windows (2–10 years) are also inconclusive in relation to effects of ACE and APOE polymorphisms (35,36).
