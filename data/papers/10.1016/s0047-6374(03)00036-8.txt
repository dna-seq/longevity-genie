Abstract

In this study, we have assessed any change in the frequency of the GG homozygotes of the 174 IL-6 polymorphism with increasing age, arguing that if IL-6 tracks with functional disability and age-related diseases, then there may be attrition or reduction in the frequency of homozgyous subjects, who produce higher levels of IL-6 in serum, in older survivors in a population. We have tested this hypothesis in a large group of free-living, mentally competent, nonagenarian and octogenarian subjects from the Belfast Elderly Longitudinal Ageing Study*BELFAST study and found that the frequency of GG homozygotes with IL-6-174C/G polymorphism / decreases with age by about 10%, compared with young controls. In addition we find that CC homozygotes have higher serum levels of IL-6 levels compared with GG (P(cid:2)0.055), with reciprocal and significant changes in the anti-inflammatory IL-10 (P(cid:2)0.05). / / Both IL-6 and IL-10 were spontaneously produced from separated mononuclear cell monolayers in elderly subjects, with significantly higher levels of secreted IL-10 supernatant levels (P(cid:2)0.05) at 20 h, for G allele subjects carrying the IL-6-174C/G / polymorphism. In conclusion, in the BELFAST study, there appears to be a reduction in the frequency of GG homozygotes in the octo/nonagenarian age group and a higher serum IL-6 level associated with CC homozygotes with reciprocal changes for the anti- inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

also increased in a range of age-related disorders such as autoimmune disease (O’Shea et al., 2002), atherosclero- sis (van der Meer et al., 2002), congestive cardiac failure (Wollert and Drexler, 2001), hypertension (Humphries et al., 2001) as well as in acute infection (Suffredini et al., 1999). Recently a promotor C/G 174 polymorphism of IL-6 has been identified which has functional activity with some groups reporting an increase in serum IL-6 associated with GG homozygotes compared with CC homozygotes (Fishman et al., 1998), though lately other groups have found an increase associated with CC homozygosity (Brull et al., 2001, 2002; Olivieri et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2001; Kiplinen et al., 2001). This

IL-6, an important cytokine at the centre of the immune response, is increased in serum in elderly people (Ershler, 1993a; Bruunsgaard et al., 2001). Although the cause is unknown, it has been associated with functional disability, cognitive decline and stroke in older people (Reuben et al., 2002; Ershler and Keller, 2000; Revilla et al., 2002). Elevation of IL-6, an acute phase reactant, is

dichotomy of results in relation to IL-6-174C/G poly- morphism and IL-6 levels remains unresolved with a few

2.2.1. IL-6 promotor polymorphism

In this study, we have assessed any change in the frequency of the GG homozygotes of the 174 IL-6 polymorphism with increasing age, arguing that if IL-6 tracks with functional disability and age-related dis- eases, then there may be attrition or reduction in the frequency of homozgyous subjects, who produce higher levels of IL-6 in serum, in older survivors in a popula- tion. We have tested this hypothesis in a large group of free-living, mentally competent, nonagenarian and oc- togenarian subjects from the Belfast Elderly Long- itudinal Ageing Study*BELFAST study (Rea et al., / 2000). In addition we have assessed the effect of the C/G polymorphism on IL-6 levels in serum in a proportion of these elderly subjects. Additionally, we looked at the effect of the IL-6 polymorphism on soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and on IL-10, important anti-inflam- matory cytokines, to assess if there was any functional effect of these anti-inflammatory cytokines which might explain serum IL-6 increases in ageing. Although we have previously demonstrated that IL-6 can be pro- duced from stimulated CD3(cid:3) lymphocytes by intracel- / lular cytokine methodology and more readily in older compared with young subjects (McNerlan et al., 2002), a good deal of evidence suggests that the increased IL-6 is produced by other cells such as monocytes (Fagiola et al., 1993; Ershler et al., 1993b). In this study, we have therefore looked for IL-6 and its anti-inflammatory partner IL-10, in monocyte supernatants separated and set up ‘in vitro’ and assessed any differential effect of the C/G 174 IL-6 polymorphism on IL-6 and IL-10 secre- tion.

DNA was extracted from whole blood by standard salting out methods (Miller et al., 1988) and the IL-6 polymorphism characterised in subject groups. PCR amplification was performed in 50 ul reaction volumes containing 67 mM Tris(cid:4)HCl ph 8.8; 16 mM (NH ) SO ; / 4 2 4 Tween; 100 uM of each dNTP, 0.1 uM of each primer; 1 units Taq polymerase (Bioline UK, Ltd, London); 2.0 ug DNA. A 1.5 mM MgCl concentration for IL-6 was 2 employed for successful amplification. After the initial denaturation step (96 8C for 5 min) cycling conditions were 90 8C for 1 min, 63 8C for 1 min, 72 8C for 1 min (35 cycles). After the final cycle the samples were held at 72 8C for 5 min and then at 15 8C until removed from the PCR machine (Perkins(cid:4)Elmer 9600 Thermal Cy- / cler). Successful amplification was confirmed using gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 ug/ml). The restriction enzyme digestion were performed in 25 ul volumes as follows; 1 ul of enzyme (100 ul), 2.5 ul 10(cid:5) restriction buffer, 0.25 / acetylated BSA, 7 ul PCR producti and 14.25 ul dd H O. Reactions were incubated at 37 8C overnight. The 2 digested samples were run on 1.5% Metaphor agarose gel (PMC Bioproducts, Maine, USA) for greater resolution. Purified PCR products (Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit) of a number of samples displaying homozygote profiles for each of the polymorphisms analysed were sequenced on a 373A automated DNA sequencer (Curran et al., 1996), using the primers at a concentration of 3.2 pmol to confirm the specificity of the amplification and the exact location and sequence of the polymorphic nucleotide encountered (modified from Fishman et al., 1998) primer FIL-6 GAACACAGAAC- TCAGATGACTGG, RIL-6 AGGAGTTCATAGCT- GGCTCCTGGAG.

2. Methods

2.2.2.1. IL-6, IL-10, sIL-6R and TGF-b ELISAs. Serum was collected into endotoxin free tubes, separated from whole blood within 4 h of collection, stored in aliquots at (cid:6)70 8C and analysed in batches using ELISA kits, / IL-6 and IL-10 (Medgenix EASIA, BioSource Europe S.A., Zoning Industriel B-6220, Fleunes, Belgium) and sIL-6R (R&D Systems). The minimum detectable doses of IL-6 was 0.094 pg/ml.

One hundred and ninety three octogenarian and nonagenarian subjects (30% male, 70% female) were enlisted from the Belfast Elderly Longitudinal Free- living Ageing STudy (BELFAST) study as previously described (Rea et al., 2000). Subjects were free-living, mentally competent and approximated Senieur protocol (Ligthart et al., 1984). One hundred and eighty two control subjects (41% male, 59% female) from the same geographical area, were enlisted from the database of the Northern Ireland Histocompatibility and Immuno- genetics Centre, Belfast City Hospital. Ethical permis- sion for the study was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Queens University of Belfast.

Thirty millilitres venous blood from each subject was collected into EDTA at a final concentration of 10(cid:6)3 M. Mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque and the monocytes allowed to adhere to 1 cm Linbro dishes for 90 min at 37 8C in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented

 

with 10% AB serum and 0.02 mM -glutamine. At the L end of this time (T0) supernatants were removed and fresh culture medium including supplements was added and the cells incubated for a further 20 h (T20). At T0 and T20 supernatants were collected from the wells, pooled, centrifuged to remove any suspended cells, aliquoted and stored at (cid:6)80 8C for cytokine measure- / ments.

The genotype frequencies and frequency of the alleles of IL-6 were compared between elderly and young subjects using x2-test. The analysis of variance (Kruskal(cid:4)Wallis test) was used to investigate the / possible relationship between cytokine levels and the IL-6 genotypes. A P value B0.05 was considered / significant.

3. Results

3.1. IL-6 genotype

The IL-6 genotype frequencies were in Hardy(cid:4)Wein- / berg equilibrium. The frequencies of the CC, CG and GG genotypes were 17, 54 and 29% in octo/nonagenar- ian subjects and 15, 47, and 38% in control subjects with a trend for a decrease in GG homozygotes in the aged group (P(cid:2)0.05). C allele frequency was 0.44 in the / elderly group compared with 0.39 in the young controls with no significant difference noted.

Fig. 1. Serum IL-6, soluble IL-6 and IL-10 levels in subjects categorised by CC, CG and GG genotypes of -174 C/G polymorphism of IL-6.

IL-6 levels in serum ranged from 1 to 40 pg/ml with a median value of 9 pg/ml. CC homozygotes showed higher values of IL-6 compared with GG homozygotes which were close to significance (P(cid:2)0.055) Fig. 1. sIL- / 6R levels ranged from 2 to 68 pg/ml with a median of 30 pg/ml. There was no significant change in sIL-6R across the IL-6-174C/G genotypes. IL-10 showed a range of values between 0(cid:4)2.5 pg/ml in serum with a median of / 1.0 pg/ml. There were significantly higher values of serum IL-10 for GG homozygotes compared with CC homozygotes (P(cid:2)0.05) which is the reverse of the / situation for IL-6.

between 500 and 1000 fold during 20 h incubation, there was no apparent differential secretion across the geno- types in comparison to the findings in serum. In contrast, IL-10 spontaneous secretion into the super- natants was increased 100 fold in G allele subjects at 20 h, with a significant increase for GG compared with CC subjects (P(cid:2)0.055) Fig. 2. /

4. Conclusions

In this study, there were several main findings. First we noted that there was a trend for a reduced frequency of the GG polymorphism of IL-6 in the octo/nonagen- arians from the BELFAST study group compared with younger subjects in the local population, aged 20(cid:4)45 / years of age. This trend appeared more marked in elderly males compared with females (Ross et al., 2003) but both groups showed an almost 10% decrease in

finding which deserves further focused attention and priority study. In this context, there are well described differences in ApoE genotype frequency across Europe and world populations which undoubtedly link into pathological and environmental disease mechanisms and differential morbidity and mortality rates from atherosclerotic-related disease, and there may be similar effects for C/G IL-6 genotypes.

noted a marked reduction in GG homozygotes in male though not female Italian centenarians compared with elderly (60(cid:4)80 years) and long-lived (80(cid:4)99 years) / / subjects. The finding of a decrease in the GG poly- morphism in Irish male octo/nonagenarian subjects is intriguing since it appears to confirm in a different study population and with a different study design, the earlier findings obtained in the Italian population (Bonafe et al., 2001). In contrast, Wang et al. (2001), in a study of community living and hospitalised nonagenarians in Finland detected no significant change in IL-6 frequen- cies between nonagenarians and 400 healthy blood donors, aged 18(cid:4)60 years, though a reduction of 2% / was noted in GG frequency in comparison with their widely age-selected younger control group. Interest- ingly, the frequency of the C allele of the IL-6-174 polymorphism, appears to vary across Europe(cid:4)Ireland / 0.45 (present study), UK 0.37(cid:4)0.45 (Fishman et al., / 1998; Brull et al., 2001), Finland 0.54 (Wang et al., 2001) and Italy 0.50 (Bonafe et al., 2001), with a report in USA of 0.39 (Ferrari et al., 2001). Intriguingly, in Asian and African-American populations the CC homozy- gotes and heterozygotes are relatively rare (Oisiri et al., 1999; Zhai et al., 2001). It is unclear whether these differences represent true pathological and disease- related pressures on population genotypes or whether they represent methodological differences. However, the trend for a reduction in GG homozygosity in elderly males would seem to be an important and consistent

Also of interest is the finding of the dichotomy of effect of the C/G 174 polymorphism on IL-6 serum levels. In this study, we have found an increase in serum IL-6 levels in CC homozygotes and subjects carrying the C allele in our octo/nonagenarian subjects in the BELFAST study. In his original study, Fishman noted an increase in serum IL-6 levels in GG homozygotes in healthy subjects compared with those with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, he demonstrated in HeLa cells that an -174C construct showed lower basal and stimulated expression of the reporter gene, com- pared with the -174G construct (Fishman et al., 1998). Conversely Jones et al. (2001) showed that subjects with small aortic aneurysms who carried the CC genotype had both the highest serum IL-6 and mortality risk, but argued that the association might not be direct but could track with co-existing atherosclerotic disease. Recently Basso et al. (2002) also showed increased IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen associated with CC genotype and improved fall in LDL with statin treatment. In other data Franceschi et al. (2001) has shown higher IL-6 levels in CC dementia subjects. In a Finnish study in neonates

A third aspect of our study was to describe the effect of the IL-6-174 C/G polymorphism on IL-6 and IL-10 secreted into supernatants collected from separated mononuclear monolayers. IL-6 has been widely de- scribed to be increased in the serum in older subjects, considered to mainly originate from mononuclear cells and its production to be influenced by a variety of physiological and other stimuli (Roubenoff et al., 1998; Bornefalk et al., 1997; Fagiola et al., 1993; Rachon et al., 2002; Ershler et al., 1993b). Like other groups, we found that IL-6 was spontaneously released from monocytes prepared from elderly subjects with increases of 100 and 10 fold for IL-6 and IL-10, respectively, after unstimulated incubation for 20 h. As in serum, we found similar effects for the monocyte supernatants with C allele subjects releasing higher levels of IL-6, with reciprocal effects for IL-10. Presumably in most infec- tious or chronic inflammatory situations, there is a balancing between the pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory cytokine network and if up regulation of the IL-6-174 C/G polymorphism can influence both IL-6 and IL-10 directly, then the fine tuning of the immune response mechanism is improved.

homozygotes and C allele carriers showed higher base- line and stimulated IL-6 levels. By contrast, Italian centenarians showed higher IL-6 levels in GG homo- zygotes who were male (Bonafe et al., 2001). Other ‘in vitro’ studies from this group, however, suggested an increase in IL-6 across the age groups in C allele subjects only (Olivieri et al., 2002). The reason for the dichotomy in these findings is not known but possible reasons might include differences in time between collection and cytokine measurement (Riches et al., 1992), different time release curves for cytokines (Burzotta et al., 2001) or ambient temperature. Other studies may have had insufficient statistical power, may have used different ELISA methods or different methods of collection, storage or assay of blood which could theoretically have allowed IL-6 to become released from activated cells (Riese et al., 2000; Muylle et al., 1993). The present study used Medegenix which is said to be unaffected by soluble inhibitors or enhancers and only measures biologically active IL-6. A further suggestion comes from a study which found that the activity of IL-6 -174 alleles may be reversed in different cell types, such as endothelial cells or macrophages. Such cells can secrete both IL-6 and IL-6 receptors and at variable times after inflammatory stimulus (Terry et al., 2000). Additionally, it has been suggested that linkage disequilibrium be- tween C/G 174 IL-6 and the 3?VNTR at IL-6 could explain the fact that in Alzheimer’s patients the CC genotype is associated with high levels of IL-6 (Fran- ceschi et al., 2001). However, it might be that study of other polymorphisms in tight linkage disequilibrium with the -174C/G IL-6 locus could throw light on the apparently contradictory findings.

This study in the BELFAST study of apparently well community-living octo/nonagenarians raises interesting questions about the role of the IL-6 C/G polymorphism in immune selection and longevity as well as informing about its role in the immunological balance of pro- inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The reduction of frequency of GG homozygotes of the IL- 6 polymorphism of IL-6 which replicates the findings of the earlier Italian study (Bonafe et al., 2001) suggests that either IL-6 or some other polymorphism in closely linked disequilibrium may select for longevity especially in males. Clearly these interesting observations need confirmation in further studies where the issue and effect of the IL6 genotype on IL-6 levels would also need to be addressed.

In this study we also described the effect of the IL-6- 174 C/G polymorphism on serum soluble IL-6 receptor and IL-10, both of which can modulate IL-6 function in vivo (Hempel et al., 1995). Although soluble IL-6 receptor can enhance IL-6 function there was no evidence that the C/G polymorphism affected IL-6 soluble receptor levels in the BELFAST subject group. Interestingly, in this study we noted the novel finding that the C/G polymorphism of IL-6 had significant and reciprocal effects on serum IL-10 compared with its effect on IL-6, with higher levels of IL-10 being associated with carriage of the G allele. This suggests that up regulation of C/G polymorphism of the IL-6 gene initiates an intricate balancing act between pro- inflammatory effects of IL-6 and the modulatory activity of the powerful anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Imbalances in the upregulation of IL-6-174 C/G gene could theoretically affect the IL-6 and IL-10 balance in vivo to influence acute and chronic diseases. Interestingly, recent evidence also shows that IL-6- 174C/G promoter activity affects baseline levels of plasma reactive protein (Vickers et al., 2002).
