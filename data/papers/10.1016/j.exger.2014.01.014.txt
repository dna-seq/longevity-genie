Preservation of functional ability is a well-recognized marker of longevity. At a molecular level, a major de- terminant of the physiological decline occurring with aging is the imbalance between production and accu- mulation of oxidative damage to macromolecules, together with a decreased efficiency of stress response to avoid or repair such damage. In this paper we investigated the association of 38 genes (311 SNPs) belonging to the pro–antioxidant pathways with physical and cognitive performances, by analyzing single SNP and gene-based associations with Hand Grip strength (HG), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Walking Speed (WS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Composite Cognitive Score (CCS) in a Cohort of 1089 Danish nonagenarians. Moreover, for each gene analyzed in the pro–antioxidant pathway, we tested the in- fluence on longitudinal survival. In the whole sample, nominal associations were found for TXNRD1 variability with ADL and WS, NDUFS1 and UCP3 with HG and WS, GCLC and UCP2 with WS (p b 0.05). Stronger associations although not holding the multiple comparison correction, were observed between MMSE and NDUFV1, MT1A and GSTP1 variabil- ity (p b 0.009). Moreover, we found that association between genetic variability in the pro–antioxidant pathway and functional status at old age is influenced by sex. In particular, most significant associations were observed in nonagenarian females, between HG scores and GLRX and UCP3 variability, between ADL levels and TXNRD1, MMSE and MT1A genetic variability. In males, a borderline statistically significant asso- ciation with ADL level was found for UQCRFS1 gene. Nominally significant associations in relation to survival were found in the female sample only with SOD2, NDUFS1, UCP3 and TXNRD1 variability, the latter two confirming previous observations reported in the same co- hort.

1. Introduction

ability to repair such damage (Balaban et al., 2005; Harman, 2009). The balance between pro-oxidants and enzymatic anti-oxidant systems may be of particular importance in the elderly, whose nutritional defi- ciencies and sedentary lifestyle concur with a depletion of dietary anti- oxidants and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress.

Aging is a very complex phenomenon, which negatively impacts the functioning ofdifferentbiological systems, leadingtoasystemic impair- ment and ultimately to death. The physiological decline occurring with aging can be determined by an imbalance between the production and accumulation of oxidative damages to macromolecules, and cellular

Decline of functional capacity and stress resistance to internal and external factors are strictly related (Simm et al., 2008) and together can be used as measures of the aging rate (Vasto et al., 2010).

The importance of the oxidative stress pathway in aging and lon- gevity, in particular, was firstly proposed by Harman in 1956 with the “oxidative stress theory of aging” (Harman, 1956) and supported by genetic screenings in model organisms, demonstrating that longevi- ty can be promoted through the manipulation of metabolism (i.e. calo- ric restriction) and resistance to oxidative stress (Vijg and Suh, 2005).

Despite considerable divergence during evolution, the same mecha- nisms appear to act in mammals too and it is considered that decreased metabolism and increased resistance to oxidative stress represent key mechanisms of prolonged lifespan in mutant mice (Bartke et al., 2001). In humans, the worsened efficiency of stress response represents a health risk, leading to the onset and accrual of major age-related dis- eases, including Alzheimer's, cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes (Lloret et al., 2008). Moreover, an association between oxida- tive imbalance and frailty syndrome was demonstrated, with an in- crease of oxidative stress in frail, institutionalized elderly people, leadingtoanaccelerationofagingprocessesincomparisonwithfreeliv- ing elderly (Serviddio et al., 2009).

Although many association studies explored the effect of genetic variability at candidate genes belonging to the oxidative stress pathway in relation to age-related clinical conditions (Crawford et al., 2012), as well as with human longevity (see Dato et al., 2013 for a complete list), few papers investigated their role on the quality of human aging, and in particular on the functional decline characterizing human senes- cence. To date, efforts were mainly devoted to investigating the associ- ation of genes related to oxidative stress with cognitive ability and cognitive aging in healthy older people (Deary et al., 2004; Harris and Deary, 2011; Harris et al., 2007; Kachiwala et al., 2005; Starr and Quinn, 2008), mainly because brain is particularly vulnerable to oxida- tive damage as a result of its high aerobic metabolism and high concen- tration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are susceptible to lipid peroxidation (Halliwell, 2006). These studies found an involvement of apolipoprotein E (APOE), catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and dystrobrevin binding protein 1(DTNBP1) genes in cognitive ability in older people; however, they did not consider very old subjects, analyzing sample population aged around 85 years as maximum (De Blasi et al., 2009; Lindenberger et al., 2008).

Briefly, this population based survey started in 1998, when 2.262 of the participants were 92.22–93.82 years of age (mean age 93.2), and survivors were subsequently re-assessed in 2000, 2003 and 2005 (Christensen et al., 2008; Nybo et al., 2001, 2003). Home-based ques- tionnaires were submitted for the collection of socio-demographic information, assessment of physical, cognitive, depressive status, sen- sory impairments, medications, self-reported health status and DNA was sampled for each subjects participating to the survey. Vital status was followed until death or January 1st 2013, whichever came first, resulting in a mean follow-up time for survivors of 13.4 years (range: 13.2–13.6). Information on survival status was retrieved from the Danish Central Population Register (Pedersen et al., 2006).

Preservation of functional ability (together with cognitive perfor- mance) is a well-recognized marker of longevity (Schupf et al., 2004). Consistently, predictors of functional status as HG and disability are key components of frailty definition at old age (Dato et al., 2012a;

Furthermore, analyses of longitudinal cohorts of Danish nonagenar- ians demonstrated that exceptional longevity does not result in exces- sive levels of disability (Christensen et al., 2008), suggesting a relationship between the general increase of life expectancy with a good maintenance of individual activities of daily living. This evidence supports the hypothesis that factors influencing the increased survival can also influence disability levels in older cohorts (Engberg et al., 2008) and so that longevity and lower disability levels may have com- mon causes at organismal level.

Permissiontocollect blood samples andusageofregister-basedinfor- mation was granted by The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics, both for initial and follow-up study.

Inthisstudy,we investigatedtheassociationbetween311 singlenu- cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 38 genes belonging to the oxidative stress pathway with functional status at very old age through a gene- based approach. To this purpose, we analyzed 1089 Danish nonagenar- ians, drawn from the longitudinal 1905 Cohort Study, a well character- ized (Christensen et al., 2009; Nybo et al., 2001, 2003) and very suitable sample for genotype–phenotype association studies (Dato et al., 2010; Soerensen et al., 2010, 2012a,b, 2013) for the associations with physical and cognitive parameters, respectively represented by HG strength, ADL, WS, MMSE and CCS.

2.2. Genetic data

Genetic data analyzed in this work were collected in the frame of a project on the study of genetic determinants of human longevity, de- scribed in Soerensen et al. (2012b), where 148 genes (1273 SNPs) be- longing to three candidate pathways (GH/IGF-1/Insulin signaling, DNA damage signaling and repair and pro–anti-oxidant pathways) were in- vestigated in two cohorts of middle aged and oldest old Danes. Briefly, candidate genes were chosen by integrating a comprehensive analysis of literature and database search. SNP selection was carried out through a dedicated protocol, which takes into account both candidate SNPs for aging and age-related diseases in each analyzed pathway and coding or potentiallyfunctionalSNPs (non-synonymous SNPs,SNPs located in po- tential splice sites or transcription factor binding sites and SNPs poten- tially inducing frame shifts or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay). Finally, HAPMAP tagging SNPs were added for reasonably covering the genetic variability in the gene region. Supplementary Table 1S reports the complete list of the 311 SNPs relative to 38 genes belonging to the pro–anti-oxidant pathway analyzed in this study.

Moreover, for verifying a possible effect of each gene on mortality, we tested the association with survival after the ninth decade of age.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Samples

1089 Danish samples were analyzed (313 males and 776 females), belonging to the “Danish 1905 Cohort Study”. General characteristic of this population and post-survey mortality data are described in Table 1.

2.3.3. Cognitive functioning

Screening of cognitive impairment was carried out by MMSE and Composite Cognitive Score tests. MMSE is a 30-point cognitive scale which evaluates several different areas of thinking including memory, judgment, calculation, abstraction, language, and visual–spatial ability (Folstein et al., 1975). MMSE scores range from 0 (lowest cognitive function) to 30 (highest cognitive function). Since the test is affected by age and educational status, the MMSE scores were normalized for these variables.

2.3. Functional parameters and survival outcome

2.3.1. Disability

ThemanagementofactivitiesofdailylivingorADL(toileting,getting up from bed, raising from a chair, walking around) was assessed by using a modification of an international and widely used scale, the Katz' Index of activities of daily living (ADL) (Katz et al., 1970). The as- sessment was based on what the subject was able to do at the time of the visit. Each activity was scored as 0 when the subject was unable to perform the activity analyzed and 1 when able to perform such activity. In the following analysis, ADL scores were dichotomized as 1 if the sub- ject was independent in all items, and 0 otherwise.

Composite cognitive score is computed by aggregating five single scores: a fluency test, forward digit span, backward digit span, immedi- ate recall and delayed recall of a 12-item list. Single items were individ- ually standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, as suggested by McGue and Christensen (2001), for facilitating the inter- pretation of results.

2.3.4. Survival outcome

2.3.2. Physical performance

The time to event was defined as the time elapsed from the visit until death. The average time to event is 1290 days. The data were not affected by censoring, i.e., all the subjects included in the analysis after the quality controls were dead at the time of the analyses.

HG was measured by a handheld dynamometer (SMEDLEY's dynamometer TTM, Tokyo, Japan) while the subject was sit- tingwiththearmclosetohis/herbody.Thetestwasrepeatedthreetimes withthestrongerhandandthemaximumofthesevalueswasusedinthe analyses.

level, samples were excluded if they had a call fraction lower than 90%. Onthe genotype level, SNPs were excludedif they had (1) a missingfre- quency (MiF) higher than 10% and (2) a frequency of rare allele (MAF)

As it regards the HG performance, two nominally significant associ- ationswere detected. Theformer, in linewithpreviously published data (Dato et al., 2012b), involved the UCP3 gene (p = 0.019) with the best SNP rs11235972 confirming the association with less HG strength pre- viously reported in the 1905 cohort; the latter involved NDUFS1 gene (p = 0.022). In the case of WS performance, the strongest association was detected for GCLC gene (p = 0.017). An effect on WS was found also for UCP2 (p = 0.032), UCP3 (p = 0.027) and NDUFS1 (p = 0.025) too, the last two confirming the association with physical status sug- gested by the correlation with HG scores; a borderline association with WS performance was detected for TXNRD1 gene too (p = 0.053), that was also associated with ADL levels in this cohort.

2.4.2. Single-SNP analysis

The association between the analyzed genetic variants and the quantitative/dichotomous traits was assessed by using linear/logistic regression models. ANOVAand thelikelihood ratio tests,asappropriate, were adopted to assess the significance of the resulting associations. Since for each SNP three different coding schemes were adopted (dom- inant, recessive and additive), the significance of the association was summarized with the MAX statistic approach used in Li et al. (2008). A complete description of this procedure is reported in the Supplemen- tary material (see Statistical Appendix).

As for MMSE, three strong associations were found, related to the NDUFV1 gene (p = 0.005), the MT1A gene (p = 0.006) and the GSTP1 gene (p = 0.009), all having a favorable effect on cognitive functioning at single SNP level. Less significant but still under the nominal level were the associations with MMSE levels of UQCRFS1 gene (p = 0.038) andGLRX(p= 0.041).Borderlinesignificantwastheassociationbetween PRDX3geneandcognitivefunctioning(p= 0.049).Nooneofthesegenes was found associated with the performance at CCS, which showed a bor- derline association with ACOX1 genetic variability only (p = 0.048).

The association between genetic variants and survival time was car- ried out with the same approach employed for the quantitative and di- chotomous traits. Cox regression models were used in place of linear and logistic models, in order to better capture the idiosyncrasies of the survival outcome (see Statistical Appendix).

Finally, no gene found associated with a functional phenotype showed a corresponding association with survival. However, two nom- inally significant associations with survival have been found in the whole sample, in relation to LOX (p = 0.013), SOD2 (p = 0.012) and UQCRFS1 (p = 0.038) genes, which variability were found to positively (LOX) and negatively (SOD2, UQCRFS1) influence the survival at gene level in this Cohort. TXNRD1, although showing a significant association with survival at SNP level (see Supplementary Table 2S_2), was not found associated with survival at gene level in the whole sample.

For each analyzed gene, the gene-based analysis was carried out using the following algorithm:

perform single SNP association analysis as describe before;

compute the gene-based statistic as the average of these single SNP statistics;

permute the dataset

,

of times, keeping LD between SNPs con- stant (i.e. permute phenotype labels);

for each permuted dataset, repeat steps

to

and build the null- distribution;

obtain the empirical p-value for the analyzed gene by comparing the original statistics with the permutation-based null-distribution.

After adjusting for multiple comparisons, none of the reported in the whole sample studied hold the statistical (Bonferroni corrected threshold: p b 1.3 × 10−3).

Gene-based analysis stratified by sex was carried out for genes car- rying at least one SNP showing a sex specific effect (p-value b 0.05 in Tables 2S_1 and 2S_2) on the analyzed traits in single SNP analysis. Table 3 reports the genes showing significant association at a nominal level of 0.05 with at least one trait under study plus survival in nonage- narian males (a) and females (b).

In males, the most interesting result was observed for UQCRFS1 gene with ADLperformance (p= 0.002) and UCP2 with WS (p= 0.009), the first one borderline significant also after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. Other nominally significant associations were found for SOD3 (p = 0.031) and XDH (p = 0.020) with ADL, GCLC (p = 0.024) with HG, CP (p = 0.021) and CYC1 (p = 0.022) with CCS. Borderline sig- nificant to a nominal level were the association of GPX4 (p = 0.045) and NOS3 (p = 0.052) with ADL and MMSE, respectively. No association with survival was reported in males for genes belonging to the pro-oxidant pathway here analyzed.

3. Results

3.1. QC analysis

After the QC phase, the final number of samples was 1080 (311 males and 769 females) including high quality genotypes for a total of 293 SNPs. In particular, 9 individuals were excluded from the analysis because of a call fraction lower than 90%. One SNP was excluded from the analysis because of a MiF value lower than 90% and one on the basis of MAF criterion (b1%) (see Supplementary Table 1S for details).

In females, a higher number of nominally significant associations were reported. The one of GLRX with HG levels (p = 0.001) hold also the correction for multiple comparisons (p b 1.3 × 10−3). Borderline significant also after correction for multiple testing (p = 0.002) are the associations of TXNRD1 gene with ADL scores, MT1A gene with MMSE performances and UCP3 with HG, in line with those found in the whole sample and reflecting the higher number of females in this Cohort. Other notable associations were observed for TXN2 with ADL (p = 0.038), UCP2 with HG strength (p = 0.008), SOD2 (p = 0.005) and GCLC (p = 0.007) with WS performances.

3.2. Gene-based analysis

Gene-based associationanalysis was carried out among the38 genes in the pro–anti-oxidant pathway and the five parameters of functional status (ADL, HG, WS, MMSE, CCS) plus survival. Table 2 lists the 14 genes showing a nominally significant association with at least one trait under study in the whole sample (p b 0.05). For each of them, the SNP showing the higher contribution to the association has been re- ported as best SNP.

As for survival, four nominally significant association with life- span were found in the female cohort, concerning the genes NDUFS1 (p = 0.009), TXNRD1 (p = 0.023), SOD2 (p = 0.035) and UCP3 (p = 0.041). This result is consistent with their associations with physical functioning and suggests that the variability of genes in the pro–antioxidant pathway can influence survival through an effect on physical performances, at least in the analyzed cohort.

Association with ADL performance was found for the TXNRD1 gene only (p = 0.010), which reported 6 nominally significant associations (p b 0.05) with this phenotype (see Supplementary Table 2S_1) at sin- gle SNP level.

Thus, physically active people should benefit from exercise-induced adaptation in cellular antioxidant defense systems, becoming less vul- nerable to acute injury and chronic inflammation, finally delaying the onset of chronic illness and improve their quality of life (Dato et al., 2013).

In this work, to the aim of investigating the possible of the pro–anti-oxidant pathway to functional status at old age, we tested the association of genes belonging to pro- and anti-oxidant pathways with predictors of physical (HG, ADL and WS) and cognitive decline (MMSE andCCS)atoldage,inacohortof Danishnonagenarians.Fewstudiesin- vestigated the genetic variations influencing physical abilities at old age and samples were mainly drawn from hospitalized and affected pa- tients. Positive association was reported between ADL levels and ACE gene by Seripa et al. (2011), while no correlation was found with APOE gene by Kulminski et al. (2008) and Bader et al. (1998), the last in a cohort of 253 healthy and disabled Italian octo- and nonagenarians. As for cognitivefunctioning, studies found an involvementof genes spe- cifically involved in neurological metabolism and dopaminergic neuromodulation, as APOE, COMT, BDNF and DTNBP1 genes, with cogni- tive ability in older adults less than 85 years (De Blasi et al., 2009; Lindenberger et al., 2008). In particular, studies demonstrated an in- volvement of genetic variability on specific cognitive areas; moreover, they suggest that aging magnifies the functional consequences of com- mon genetic polymorphisms on specific abilities, such as executive functioning and working memory, contributing to the marked hetero- geneity in late-life cognitive functioning.

We moved forward exploring the association with functional status of genes belonging to a specific metabolic pathway, demonstrated to be biologically involved in physical and cognitive impairment.

Overall, only 2 of the top 14 genes found associated with functional in this work have been previously reported in association studies physical status at old age, in Italian and Danish Cohorts (the latter the same used in the present paper), and they belong to UCPs family et al., 2011; Dato et al., 2012b). Both UCP2 and UCP3 confirmed have a major effect on physical tests such as HG and WS in the whole as well as in the two gender separately, with the rs11235972 survivalatold age too. Theassociation of UCP3 gene var- with physical exercise is particular relevant, considering its ex- in skeletal muscle, where it regulates fatty acid metabolism, status, and ROS production, suggesting a correlation between uncoupling process and the regulation of muscle metabolism/ in the elderly (Dato et al., 2012b and references therein).

All theotherassociationsare new and opentheinvestigationof their variability in future studies. Furthermore, associations holding the mul- tiple comparison correction were found in the female sub-sample, sug- gesting a sex-specific effect of the pro–anti-oxidant pathway on the analyzed functional parameters.

tive performances) is a well-recognized marker of longevity (Schupf et al., 2004). Physicalactivityhasmanywell-establishedhealthbenefits, going from the maintenance of muscle mass to the delay of cognitive impairment, to the promotion of a psychological wellness; however, itisknownthatastrenuousexercisecanbedisadvantageousforlongev- ity, because it can increases muscle oxygen flux, stimulating intracellu- lar events leading to an enhanced oxidative stress (Dato et al., 2013 and references therein). A moderate exercise can instead induce anti- oxidant adaptation, thereby balancing oxidative stress and muscle dete- rioration, as demonstrated by an increase of two years in the average lifespan and a delayed in disabilities of physically active people in com- parisonwithlessactive(Ji,2002).Progressiveoxidativedamageisalsoa conserved central mechanism of age-related cognitive decline, because of the higher consumption of oxygen (more than 20% than other tis- sues) in the brain, with the consequent exposition to ROS from mito- chondrial respiration. As for the muscle mass, a regular physical activity seems to protect against brain damage, by preventing brain

Thegene having a major effectonADLphenotype is TXNRD1, bothin the whole sample (p = 0.010) and specifically in the female sub-group, where the association is very close to significance also after correction for multiple testing (p = 0.002). Although borderline, TXNRD1 was as- sociated with WS in the whole sample too, confirming the influence that this genecan have on functionalactivity.Thioredoxin(Trx)is acru- cialproteinfor antioxidant defense, is aredox regulator of theintra- and extra-cellularsignalingpathways andtranscriptionfactors,and contrib- utesintheproteinfoldingthroughthecatalysisofsulfur-exchangereac- tions among protein complexes. Mammalian Trx have been associated with neuro-protection against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Masutani et al., 2004) and their up-regulation has been suggested as a good strategy for prevention and treatment of these disabling age- related diseases. The genetic variability of TXNRD1 (rs10047589) has been found associated with late life survival in a previous work from our group (Soerensen et al., 2012b); the present work confirms the as- sociationofTXNRD1genewithsurvivalinthiscohort,inparticularinthe

female population (p = 0.024), adding the evidence that the gene can have a role in the quality of aging too, at least in the Danish population.

A major effect on ADL score was also observed for the UQCRFS1 gene in the male sample, which unfavorable association with ADL in the sub- sample converges in a correlation with a lower survival chance in the whole sample studied. This protein, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome C Reduc- tase, Rieske iron–sulfur polypeptide 1, is a subunit of Complex III of themitochondrialrespiratorychain.Its variabilityhasneverbeeninves- tigated in relation to human longevity and related phenotypes; howev- er, considering that the proper functioning of mitochondrial respiration is crucial for the cellular homeostasis and its de-regulation can increase oxidative stress, the observed result suggests the importance of an effi- cient oxidative phosphorylation for maintaining a good level of activity and independence in daily occupations after the ninth decade of life.

Possiblelimitationsofthepresentstudycanbefoundinthemethod- ology of the gene-based approach itself, which allows to identifying an effect on specific phenotypes but lacks in establishing the direction of this effect. For such a reason, favorable or unfavorable effects can be de- duced at single SNP level only. Furthermore, the male sample is may be undersized respect to the female one: this unbalance in sample compo- sition, although common in association studies with longevity, due to the sex-ratio characterizing long-lived cohorts (Passarino et al., 2002), can explain the inconsistent findings between the two genders, when separately considered.

5. Conclusions

In the whole sample as in the two genders separately, a broadly pro- tective role for the maintenance of a good functional status seems to be deserved totheglutathione(GSH)sub-pathway.Inparticular,genesbe- longing to the GSH sub-pathway were associated with WS (GCLC) and MMSE levels (GLRX and GSTP1) in the whole sample. In males, GPX4 and GCLC variability were found associated with ADL and HG strength, respectively. In females, the association between GLRX and HG hold also for the multiple comparison correction (p = 0.001), further sug- gesting that GSH metabolism can have an effect on functional status at old age. Such an effect may be linked to oxidative stress response, but also to other cellular mechanisms controlled by this metabolic way. The genes found associated with functional status in this work belong to the Free -Radical Induced Apoptosis pathway (http://www.biocarta.com/ pathfiles/h_freePathway.asp) activated in endothelial cells as a response to inflammation-related oxidative stress and playing a role insusceptibil- ityto cancer, and otherdiseases. As anexample,polymorphisms ofGSTP1 were found associated with different cancers and chemotherapy re- sponse (Sekine et al., 2007; Strange and Fryer, 1999), while mutations at GCLC locus have been associated with myocardial infarction (Koide et al., 2003). Furthermore, the apoptotic events activated by GSH sub- pathway in endothelial cells for resisting to oxidativestress have beenin- volved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis (Ballatori et al., 2009), another clinical conditions typical of old age. On the whole, this is the first work demonstrating an influence of GSH sub-pathway in age-related non pathological phenotypes, which may influence the qual- ity of aging.

In conclusion, this work supports a role of the pro–anti-oxidant pathway in physical and cognitive status after the ninth decade of life, particularly evidencing the effect of some sub-pathways, as UCP, Gluta- thione and thioredoxin pathways for the maintenance of functional sta- tusat old age. Therole of thesegenes in the preservationof physical and cognitive statusmaybeinfluenced bygender,suggestingpossible inter- actionswithendocrinesystems, inlinewith recentevidences indicating a role of oxidative stress in the aging of the endocrine system, converg- ing on the induction or regulation of inflammatory status typical of old age (Vitale et al., 2013). In addition, a new association was reported in relation to MMSE levels, related to metallothionein gene MT1A, which open new ways of investigations of this gene family in relation to cogni- tive functioning in humans.

It is clear that final conclusions on the role of the genetic variants on stress mechanisms can be drawn only after confirmation by functional analyses. However, we believe that all the associations found in this study deserve attention for future replications studies.

In general, the variability of genes affecting stress response in differ- ent individuals and populations deserve future studies. In fact, although oxidativestresspathwayhas been extensively characterized from a bio- chemical and molecular point of view, thanks to experimental models and knock out approaches, population association studies investigating the role of genetic variability in genes coding for proteins belonging to the oxidative stress cascade, as key point regulators such as NFkB or MAP kinases, are still scarce. Instead, a deeper knowledge of the genetic background able to provide a more or less efficient stress response and influence age-associated traits can help to understand the link between stress response and human aging, finally adding a piece to the complex scenario of determinants of human longevity.

Non negligible effects on physical functioning were also suggested for NDUFS1, which variability was found related to HG and WS in the whole sample. The strong association (p = 0.009) of the same gene with survival in the female subsample suggests that NDUFS1 gene, cod- ifying for the largest subunit of mitochondrial complex 1, and which mutations were correlated with inefficiency of oxidative phosphoryla- tion in Leigh Syndrome (Martín et al., 2005), can have a role also in the preservation of physical functioning at old age and lastly influence survival.

Conflict of interest

Furthermore, very interesting is the association with MMSE levels (p = 0.005) observed in the whole sample for MT1A variability, overall found to be protective for cognitive functioning at SNP level. Consider- ing that the over expression of MT (metallothionein gene, member of a large family of proteins with anti-apoptotic effect) was the only dem- onstrated to increase mouse lifespan (Swindell, 2011), protecting against obesity and diet-induced oxidative damage, we may argue that these genes would deserve future attention for their relation with longevity and related phenotypes. Borderline effects on cognitive per- formances have been observed for NOS3 variability both in the male (p = 0.052 with MMSE) and female sample (p = 0.023 with CCS), in line with previous evidences indicating an association the gene with mild cognitive impairment (Solé-Padullés et al., 2004). Considering the recent evidence of association between the genetic variability of NOS1 and NOS3 genes with depressive symptoms and disability in a population from Southern Italy, finally influencing quality of aging and longevity (Montesanto et al., 2013), the present results suggest
