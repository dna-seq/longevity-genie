Abstract

Human longevity and healthy aging show moderate heritability (20%–50%). We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from 9 studies from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium for 2 outcomes: (1) all-cause mortality, and (2) survival free of major disease or death. No single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was a genome-wide significant predictor of either outcome (p << 5 “ees” 10(cid:3)8). We found 14 independent SNPs that predicted risk of death, and 8 SNPs that predicted event-free survival (p »< | 10(cid:3)5). These SNPs are in or near genes that are highly expressed in the brain (HECW2, HIP1, BIN2, GRIA1), genes involved in neural development and function (KCNQ4, LMO4, GRIA1, NETO1) and autophagy (ATG4C), and genes that are associated with risk of various diseases including cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. In addition to considerable overlap between the traits, pathway and network analysis corroborated these findings. These findings indicate that variation in genes involved in neurological processes may be an important factor in regulating aging free of major disease and achieving longevity.

1. Introduction

The recent, remarkable extension of life expectancy is largely attributed to the postponement of mortality at old age (Vaupel, 1997, 2010). The years of life gained in the older population residing in developed nations are a success story of public health measures and improved health care. In addition to such external factors, longevity and healthy aging consistently show a modest heritability between 20% and 50% and aging-associated genetic research may provide further insights into the mechanisms of aging (Herskind et al., 1996; McGue et al., 1993; Reed and Dick, 2003). It has been postulated that genes involved in pathways associated with aging identified in animal models, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-insulin signaling, regulation of lipopro- tein metabolism, the mTOR pathway, and the oxidative stress response may also influence survival to old or even exceptionally old age in humans (Christensen et al., 2006; Kenyon, 2010; Vellai et al., 2003). However, in humans, common variants within genes involved in these pathways

to aging in humans may be due to the complexity of the phenotype. One approach to investigate aging and longevity is to compare frequencies of genetic variants between no- nagenarians or centenarians and the general population. This approach led to the discovery of an association be- tween APOE (Deelen et al., 2011; Ewbank, 2007; Gerdes et al., 2000) and more recently FOXO3A (Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009a; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Willcox et al., 2008) and human aging and longevity. However, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individuals reaching the age of 90 or older failed to identify genome-wide significant variants (Newman et al.,

Prospective follow-up studies with a continuous outcome such as time to death are more powerful than case-control analyses. A study of time to death simultaneously addresses the effects of genetic variation related to life span, the progression toward death, and disease-specific mortality. This design has been successfully applied in animal models (Finch and Ruvkun, 2001; Kenyon, 2010) and also in hu- man genetics research of blood pressure (Levy et al., 2009; Newton-Cheh et al., 2009; van Rijn et al., 2007), a trait with heritability similar to longevity, where examination of a continuous outcome has been more successful in identifying genetic loci than studies that have solely used hypertension

least 4 out of 6 of the health conditions. Genome-wide information on polymorphisms was available for 16,995 participants free of disease at the beginning of the study. These participants were followed for 8.8 (SD 5.7) years and we registered 7314 major events.

as a dichotomous trait. Frailty and survival free of disease have been suggested as more promising phenotypes for studies of aging because mortality is a very heterogeneous outcome caused by multiple chronic conditions (Vijg and Suh, 2005).

sequential way using data from cohort studies participating in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium. First, we aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) associated with all cause mortality (time to death) in a hypothesis-free GWAS in approximately 25,000 unselected persons of Eu- ropean ancestry. Second, we performed GWAS of time to event, defined by major incident events (myocardial infarc- tion, heart failure, stroke, dementia, hip fracture, or cancer) or death, as an alternative phenotype for healthy aging. Last, we analyzed the SNPs along with their respective most likely associated genes identified in the GWAS meta-anal- yses to identify pathways and networks associated with aging and longevity.

2.3. Genotyping and imputation

As different genotyping platforms were used across stud- ies, we imputed to 2.5 million SNPs using the HapMap 22 CEU (Build 36) genotyped samples as a reference. For details on the study-specific quality control procedures for genotyping and imputation please consult Supplementary Table S1.

2.4. Statistical analysis

We used the semiparametric Cox proportional hazard to model time to event for both phenotypes in each study. Follow-up time since baseline was used as time scale. An additive genetic model was used in this analysis. We sub- sequently combined the individual study results in a meta- analysis using a fixed effects model that combined the study-specific regression parameters and standard errors us- ing inverse variance weighting. We included SNPs that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 1% and an imputation quality ratio (de Bakker et al., 2008) (equivalent to the MaCH r2 statistic; Li et al., 2009b) of at least 0.3. The study-specific inflation factors ((cid:1) ) were computed using GC the set of chi-square statistics used for the meta-analysis for each study. The inflation factor is computed as the median of all chi-square statistics divided by the expected median of the statistics (approximately 0.456) for a chi-square distri- bution with 1 degree of freedom. SNP associations at p r<! 5  10(cid:3)8 were considered to be genome-wide significant. SNPs with p  5  10(cid:3)5 were considered suggestive associations. The combined meta-analysis hazard ratio (HR) can be interpreted as the increase in the risk of dying or having a major event during follow-up per additional copy of the coded allele. Power analysis revealed 80% statistical power to detect SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 5% and relative risk of 1.10 using a nominal significance level of 0.05 (Supplementary Table S2).

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

stem from cohorts of the CHARGE Consortium (Psaty et al., 2009). All cohorts are follow-up studies periodically assessing the health and vital status of their participants. Although some of the cohorts included multiple ethnic groups, only data from self-reported Caucasians were used. In addition, population structure was assessed using princi- pal components in each CHARGE study and outliers were removed. Any remaining within-study structure was ad- justed for using appropriate methods (Price et al., 2006). All participants included in this analysis were at least 55 years of age at the time of blood draw for DNA and provided written informed consent. A brief description of each pop- ulation is given in the Supplementary Information.

2.2. Phenotype

We conducted a survival analysis, adjusted for age at baseline and sex, to model continuous time to death or end  of follow-up in 25,007 participants (deceased “cases” ee 8444; mean follow-up time 10.6 [SD 5.4] years) that were older than 55 years at baseline. As research demon- strated that the likelihood of incident disease is genetically determined, we defined a second phenotype: survival free of major disease or mortality (Atzmon et al., 2004; Lunetta et al., 2007; Vijg and Suh, 2005). The outcome was defined as time to the first of the following adjudicated events: myo- cardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, dementia, hip frac- ture, cancer, or death. For this analysis, participants at baseline were older than 55 years of age and free of any of the aforementioned conditions. Inclusion in the study re- quired complete follow-up information on mortality and at

In addition, we incorporated gene annotation informa- tion, a technique that has successfully been applied in the field of aging research (de Magalhaes et al., 2009a, 2010). Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER; Mi et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2003) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (www.ingenuity.com) were used for identification and classification of networks, pathways, biological processes, and molecular functions of the genes identified in this study. For both phenotypes we generated lists of candidate genes. These genes were the closest reference genes to the SNPs associated with the outcome at p  1 oN 10(cid:3)3. PANTHER compares these gene lists to the reference list using the binomial test for each molecular function, biological process, or pathway term.

3. Results

death adjusted for baseline age and sex in participants of European origin, 55 years of age or older from 9 longitu- dinal cohort studies participating in the CHARGE Consor- tium (Psaty et al., 2009). In total, we observed 8444 deaths (mean age at death: 81.1, SD 8.4) in 25,007 participants (55% female) after an average follow-up of 10.6 (SD 5.4) years. Descriptive characteristics of participants and Man- hattan plots showing genome wide p-values for association are displayed in the Supplementary data (Supplementary Fig. S1, and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). The quan- tile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) of observed versus expected p-values showed only a small deviation from the null hy- pothesis, indicating no significant population stratification   (Fig. 1a, 1.066). Although there were no genome- GC wide significant findings (p   5 _ 10(cid:3)8), 14 independent SNPs were associated with time to death at a suggestive threshold of p << 1  10(cid:3)5 (Table 1). Among these SNPs, rs4936894 (chromosome 11, near the von Willebrand factor A domain containing 5A gene [VWA5A]) had the strongest association with time to death (p  3.4 4ads| xX 10(cid:3)7). We sought replication for 5 of the 14 top SNPs with the strongest association with time to death in 4 independent samples    (n 10,411, deaths 1295) of the same ancestry. None of the SNPs were consistently associated with time to death at << a nominally significant level of p 0.05 across all replica- tion samples (Supplementary Tables S5–S8). In the com- bined meta-analysis of the discovery and replication studies only rs1425609 in the vicinity of otolin-1 (OTOL1) showed a stronger association (1.61 “J ™ 10(cid:3)6).

Likewise, no genome-wide significant findings were identified in the time to event analysis following 16,995 participants free of disease at baseline and registering 7314 events over an average of 8.8 (SD 5.7) years of follow-up (Table 2). Events included incident myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, dementia, hip fracture, and cancer or ane  death. The Q-Q plot (Fig. 1a, 1.019) showed no GC evidence of inflation of type I error. In total, there were 8 independent SNPs associated with event-free survival at p er 10(cid:3)5. The SNP with the strongest association was rs10412199 (chromosome 19, p  3.02   10(cid:3)6), which is in close proximity to ataxia, cerebellar, Cayman type (AT- CAY). Additional descriptive information including defini- tions of each event and association results with p co‘ 10(cid:3)4 are provided in Supplementary Figure S2, and Supplemen- tary Tables S9–S12.

the overlap between their association results (Table 3). In- terpretation of the overlap between the phenotypes requires caution as both phenotypes are correlated, nevertheless it helps to focus on specific loci and put them into the context of aging. From the 14 loci passing the prespecified, sugges- tive threshold of p r< 1  10(cid:3)5 in the time to death analysis, 5 had corresponding SNPs within 500 kilo base pairs dis- tance, in linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2  0.1) associated with p << 1  10(cid:3)4 and the same overall direction of the effect in the time to event analysis. These 5 regions were in the vicinity of the following genes: OTOL1 (3q26.1), bridg- ing integrator 2 (BIN2, 12q13), ATG4 autophagy related 4 homolog C (ATG4C, 1p31.3), origin recognition complex,

As both phenotypes may provide different but compli- mentary information about the aging process, we evaluated

Finally, we evaluated candidate genes for aging by iden- tification and classification of networks, pathways, biolog- ical processes, and molecular functions. The candidate genes were derived from the meta-analyses of GWAS and included the reference genes closest to the SNPs associated with p r< 1  10(cid:3)3 (time to death: 862 genes, time to event: 704 genes). We used PANTHER (Mi et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2003, 2006) and IPA software (www.ingenuity.com) for these analyses. PANTHER compares these gene lists to the reference list using the binomial test for each molecular function, biological process, or pathway term. IPA builds networks by searching the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base for interactions between the identified genes and all other gene objects stored in the knowledge base.

processes overrepresented in the PANTHER analysis were developmental processes, neuronal activities, signal transduc- tion, neurogenesis, ectoderm development, and cell adhesion. For the analysis of time to incident event, developmental pro- cesses and neuronal activities were overrepresented among other biological process (Table 4). The analyses also high- lighted the Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling path- way is ubiquitous and known to be involved in cancer but also plays an important role in the early stages of the development of the central nervous system, in synaptic formation by axon guidance, and in modulating fibrosis during muscle repair scored high in both traits under study (Brack et al., 2007; Inestrosa and Arenas, 2010; Keeble et al., 2006; Ulloa and Martí, 2010). For extended tables see Supplementary Tables S13 and S14. In addition, Ingenuity identified 1 network with p  10(cid:3)31 containing 26 genes involved in processes related to nervous system develop- ment and function for the analysis of time to death (Fig. 2) and 1 network with p  10(cid:3)40 containing 28 genes involved in cellular function and development for time to event (Supplementary Fig. S3).

IPA analysis highlighted the following genes associated with the time to death trait: NTRK2 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2)—a member of the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase family. This kinase is a membrane- bound receptor that, upon neurotrophin binding, phospho- rylates itself and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Signaling through this kinase leads to cell differentiation. Second in line were NCAM1 (neural cell adhesion molecule 1)—a cytoskeletal binding

physiological processes and diseases that act as intermediate factors on the pathway to death (de Magalhaes et al., 2010). Therefore, any common variation in genes associated with aging probably has a small effect.

protein, GRID2 (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2)—a relatively new member of the family of ionotropic gluta- mate receptors which are the predominant excitatory neu- rotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain, and have a role in neuronal apoptotic death, and RIMS1 (regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 1), which regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and may be part of the protein scaffold of the cell.

Second, the largely negative findings of this and other studies contrast with the intriguing animal studies of lon- gevity. Very large effects of single genes on lifespan have indeed been observed in laboratory animals, but humans often have several homologues of these genes which might significantly differ in function or compensate for mutated genes through redundant mechanisms (Kuningas et al., 2008). This could explain why our top findings did not include genes in these pathways found in animal models. Animal models also represent genetically homogenous pop- ulations and are exposed to controlled environmental influ- ences. The lack of replication of animal model findings in humans suggests that the use of knockout animals may not provide the optimal approach to understanding the variation in survival in humans as interactions with environmental factors may obscure the associations and prevent the iden- tification of loci in humans.

Among the genes that were highlighted through the IPA analysis in the analysis of time to event was MYC (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog)—a multifunc- tional, nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cellular transformation. MYC functions as a transcription factor that regulates transcrip- tion of specific target genes. Second in line were E2F1 (E2F transcription factor 1), EGFR (epidermal growth factor re- ceptor), and CEBPA (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [C/ EBP], alpha). EF21, a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle and action of tumor sup- pressor proteins can mediate both cell proliferation and p53-dependent/independent apoptosis. EGFR is a trans- membrane glycoprotein that serves as a receptor for mem- bers of the epidermal growth factor family and supports cell proliferation. CEBP-Alpha, a bZIP transcription factor, can bind as a homodimer to certain promoters and enhancers. CEBPA also forms heterodimers with the related proteins CEBP-beta and CEBP-gamma and modulates the expres- sion of leptin, interacts with CDK2 and CDK4, and thereby inhibits these kinases and causes growth arrest in cultured cells.

Third, our study is based on common genetic variants and therefore we cannot exclude effects due to low fre-  quency and rare variants ( 5%) or due to the presence of structural variation, such as copy number polymorphisms. Our discovery set may lack the power to identify all the relevant loci, even though we had sufficient power to detect  common SNPs (minor allele frequency 5% or more) with a relative risk of 1.10 (Supplementary Table S2).

Last, we cannot exclude that phenotypic heterogeneity our findings. While all cohorts had prospectively information on major health events and diagnoses, in the methods of assessment and classifica- might have limited the ability to identify true effects.

4. Discussion

tion might have limited the ability to identify true effects. Complex diseases may result from the effects of a large number of low frequency variants, with substantial allelic heterogeneity at disease-causing loci (Pritchard, 2001; Pritchard and Cox, 2002; Swarbrick and Vaisse, 2003). Theoretical modeling that incorporates mutation, random genetic drift, and purifying selection suggests that many of the variants that affect complex traits may be in the 1%–5% frequency range (Pritchard, 2001). Indeed, sequencing of candidate genes in an attempt to capture such low frequency variants, has led to the identification of rare variants with modest effects on body mass index (Ahituv et al., 2007; Challis et al., 2002; Cone, 2000), triglyceride levels (Romeo et al., 2007), high-density lipoprotein (HDL; Cohen et al., 2004; Romeo et al., 2007) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (Cohen et al., 2005, 2006; Ko- towski et al., 2006).

In our analyses of over 25,000 individuals of 55 years and older followed for an average of 11 years, we did not identify genome-wide significant associations for all-cause mortality and survival free of major diseases. However, both traits highlighted loci with suggestive significance that were in the neighborhood of genes related to neural regu- lation. In addition, our pathway and network analyses iden- tified an enrichment of genes associated with cellular and neural development and function, and cell communication that may contribute to variation in human aging. Brain development might be responsible for the creation of redun- dancy in brain circuitry, which is associated with functional reserve and resiliency. Brain function regulates most of the compensatory strategy supporting maintenance of homeo- static equilibrium. Both of these processes are essential to healthy aging and longevity.

Several explanations are possible for the lack of genome- wide significant findings. First, mortality is arguably 1 of the most complex phenotypes, and several trajectories to- ward extreme old age have been identified (Evert et al., 2003). Multiple genes could mediate the aging process but would have their effects through numerous different patho-

It is impossible to determine the functional variant of a gene by GWAS. Moreover, we cannot conclude from the location of an SNP that this variation is involved in the expression of the closest gene. However, our top results suggested a possible role of genes involved in neurological

genes that were involved in most pathways indeed had substantial effects within the analyzed trait. NTRK2 (Rico et al., 2002), NCAM1 (Rutishauser et al., 1988), GRID2 (Hirai et al., 2003), and RIMS1 (Johnson et al., 2003; Schoch et al., 2002) are associated with neuronal development and disease pathways that were highlighted in the analysis of time to death. MYC (Cole, 1986; Goga et al., 2007), E2F1 (Nevins, 2001), EGFR (Wang et al., 2004), and CEBPA (Ménard et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2001) are associated with “cancer,” “cell function,” and “development” pathways.

processes in human longevity and aging. Ten of the 22 suggestive associations identified in our analyses are in or near genes that are highly expressed in the brain (HECW2 [Rotin and Kumar, 2009], HIP1 [Blanpied et al., 2003], BIN2, GRIA1), were previously related to the regulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity (KCNQ4 [Van Eyken et al., 2006], LMO4 [Joshi et al., 2009; Leuba et al., 2004], GRIA1), and the maintenance of neural circuitry and syn- aptic plasticity (NETO1), or are associated with neurologi- cal diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (LMO4 [Leuba et al., 2004], BIN2, GRIA1, GRIN2B), and amyotrophic lat- eral sclerosis (GRIN2B). In addition, 6 of the 22 SNPs were in close proximity to genes associated with other pheno- types of aging such as autophagy (ATG4C [Kenyon, 2010]), cancer (ATG4C [Maiuri et al., 2009], HIP1 [Bradley et al., 2007], HECW2 [Rotin and Kumar, 2009], VWA5A [Zhou et al., 2009], MECOM), and mitochondrial depletion syn- drome (SUCLA2). Notably, BIN2, ATG4C, KCNQ4, MECOM, and SUCLA2 showed associations with both traits in our study.

Few if any of the top hits from the GWAS were involved in common pathways of aging, typically ad- dressed in candidate gene studies. For example, there was no specific evidence for genes involved in IGF-insulin signaling. However, this negative finding cannot be in- terpreted as evidence against the importance of IGF- insulin signaling, as well as other processes such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cellular damage and re- pair, growth hormone, and cell proliferation in aging. Moreover, it is possible that polymorphisms in related genes have an effect in the oldest old, who were repre- sented by fewer numbers in our study population such that our study design would be underpowered to detect it. It is also conceivable that the neurological pathways identified by our analysis interact with the known candi- date genes involved in aging (Bishop et al., 2010; Finch and Ruvkun, 2001). It is feasible that the traditional aging pathways are hierarchically controlled by neurons and that the brain might be the location coordinating physi- ological changes (Bishop et al., 2010; Finch and Ruvkun, 2001). Because neurons are particularly susceptible to damage caused by reactive oxygen species, limitations in cellular maintenance and repair might reinforce these pathways and accelerate aging (Finch and Ruvkun, 2001). An increased ability of neuronal cells to prevent or repair oxidative damage might result in beneficial hor- monal signaling, otherwise deregulated with age, thus delaying the onset of age-related disease and directly regulating cognitive aging and life span (Bishop et al., 2010; Cutler and Mattson, 2006; de Magalhães and Sand- berg, 2005).

Using the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) browser (eqtl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/eqtl/) we de- tected eQTL associated with HIP1, COL5A1, LOC340156, and SMARCA2 in time to death only.

Interestingly, SNPs known to be associated with longev- ity and disease in the neighborhood of APOE (Deelen et al., 2011) orFOXO3A (Flachsbart et al., 2009; Willcox et al., 2008) only reached nominal significance (results not shown). These genes were originally identified in studies of centenarians; it is possible that our study of cohorts com- prised of individuals from the general populations did not have sufficient statistical power to identify these genes with certainty. (Tan et al., 2008).

While meta-analysis of GWAS has the power to detect small changes of allele frequencies between groups with the analyzed trait, true association signals may not be revealed based on a stringent genome-wide significance threshold. This situation, although limiting false positive findings, per- forms poorly in identifying false negatives as they may fall below the threshold. Network analyses using a less stringent significance threshold do not amend the overall negative finding of this study. However, it is well-recognized that within the many associations that failed to attain this level of significance lie true positive associations. Network anal- yses can provide useful information exploring multiple gene effects and their interactions.

In conclusion, our analysis did provide suggestive evi- dence that aging is under neuronal control. Unfortunately, we have no relevant tissue or expression experiment avail- able to further underscore or validate our findings. Future investigations of changes of gene expression with age at cellular and population levels are warranted.

In fact the interpretation of most GWAS results is diffi- cult because individual results may involve many seemingly unrelated genes. Because PANTHER and IPA are built on different conceptual approaches, database sources and dif- ferent pathway classifications, they can be seen as comple- mentary approaches. Our pathway and network analyses highlighted neuronal activities and organism developmental processes as major biological processes involved aging. In addition, it highlighted Wnt signaling and showed that those
