Exceptional longevity is associated with substantial heritability. The ε4 allele in apolipoprotein E and the linked G allele in rs2075650 of TOMM40 have been associated with increased mortality and the ε2 allele with decreased mortality, although inconsistently. Offspring from long-lived families and spouse controls were recruited at 3 sites in the United States and Denmark. We used generalized estimating equations to compare the likelihood of carrying risk alleles in offspring (n ¼ 2307) and spouse controls (n ¼ 764), adjusting for age, sex, level of education, and family membership. The likelihood of carrying an APOE ε4 allele or a G allele in rs2075650 was lower (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; p ¼ 0.005 and OR, 0.70; p ¼ 0.002) and the likelihood of carrying an APOE ε2 allele was higher (OR,1.5; p ¼ 0.007) among family members in the offspring generation than among their spouse controls. Our findings support the hypothesis that both reduction in the frequency of the ε4 allele and increase in the frequency of the ε2 allele contribute to longevity.

consistently emerged as a determinant of longevity (Deelen et al., 2011; Nebel et al., 2011, Sebastiani, et al., 2012). APOE has 3 common alleles, ε2, ε3, and ε4. The ε4 allele of APOE has been associated with early mortality and a decreased frequency of the allele in the oldest old (McKay et al., 2011; Schachter et al., 1994; Soerensen et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2004). However, the association of the ε4 allele with mortality risk is inconsistent and varies by pop- ulation (Bader et al., 1998; Galinsky et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2001). Some studies (Ewbank, 2002, 2007) reported that the effect of the ε4 allele on mortality risk diminishes with increasing age, but a recent study in the Danish 1905 cohort showed an increased effect of carrying the ε4 alleles with increasing age (Jacobsen et al., 2010). Recent studies have also identified a variant inTOMM40, marked by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2075650, which is associated with longevity, but is close to and in linkage disequi- librium with rs429358, the marker for the APOE ε4 allele (Deelen et al., 2011; Nebel et al., 2011; Sebastiani et al., 2012).

1. Introduction

Human exceptional longevity is the outcome of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental influences (Finch and Tanzi, 1997; McGue et al., 1993). Exceptional longevity has been noted to cluster in families and is associated with moderate heri- tability (De Benedictis et al., 2001; Herskind et al., 1996; Mitchell et al., 2001). In a study of centenarians and their siblings, male and female siblings of centenarians were 17 and 8 times more likely, respectively, to survive to 100 years compared with males and females in their birth cohort (Perls et al., 2002). First degree rela- tives of individuals who lived beyond 95 years were twice as likely to survive to the same age as were relatives of married-in controls (Gudmundsson et al., 2000; Kerber et al., 2001).

Several candidate genes have been investigated to determine their effects on life span and apolipoprotein E (APOE) has

Because longevity is heritable, a family-based study design might serve well to address the question of the relation of APOE to longevity. Mortality associated with the presence of a risk allele

might lead to reduced frequencies of risk alleles in the parental generation. Thus, it might be more informative to examine if there is a reduced frequency of risk alleles in offspring of people achieving exceptional longevity, where mortality is unlikely to confound the association between genetic risk factors and longevity. We exam- ined the likelihood of carrying an APOE ε4 or ε2 allele and distri- bution of the TOMM40 SNP rs2075650 in the offspring generation of the Long Life Family Study (LLFS). We hypothesized that offspring of LLFS members would have a decreased frequency of the APOE ε4 allele, a decreased frequency of the G allele in TOMM40 rs2075650 and an increased frequency of the APOE ε2 allele compared with similarly aged peers not selected for familial longevity.

and at least 1 living sibling were able to give informed consent and willing to participate in the in-person interview and examination, including providing blood for serum and for extraction of DNA; and either the proband or a sibling had a living offspring willing to participate. A minimum of 2 siblings and 1 offspring was required for the key triad. Additionally, we recruited and enrolled the spouses of interested individuals, primarily in the offspring gener- ation, to serve as a comparison group ascertained from the same source populations, but not selected for familial longevity. Spouse controls were employed to adjust for characteristics of individuals within a family which are likely to be correlated. Before examina- tion, written informed consent was obtained from all enrollees. The Institutional Review Boards at of all of the Field Centers and the Data Management and Coordinating Center (Washington Univer- sity, St. Louis) in the United States reviewed and approved this project and the regional Institutional Review Board in Denmark reviewed and approved this project.

2. Methods

Long-lived individuals, their siblings, and their offspring were recruited for an examination that characterized key intermediate phenotypes of longevity, including major chronic diseases, risk factors, and physical and cognitive function. A referent group con- sisting of the spouses, primarily of the offspring generation, was also recruited and examined. For this study, we restricted the analysis to the offspring generation and the examined sons, daughters, nieces, and nephews (n ¼ 2314) and their spouses (n ¼

2.3. Genotyping

Among offspring and their married-in controls, we were able to genotype APOE for 2307 of 2371 offspring (97.3%) of probands and their siblings and 764 of 793 spouse controls (96.3%). We were able to genotype the TOMM40 SNP rs2075650 for 2274 (95.9%) offspring and 746 married-in controls (94.1%). Of the 3071 participants in the analysis, 983 were Danish (32.0%).

2.1. Recruitment

Genotyping of APOE polymorphisms was based on SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 and was performed at the Biomedical Genomics Center at the University of Minnesota. Genotyping was performed using the Taqman genotyping platform and concordance among genotypes for both SNPs was 100% based on 51 blinded duplicates. We also sequenced DNA from 12 samples with different APOE genotypes to assure correct assignment of alleles. Genotyping of the TOMM40 SNP rs2075650 was performed as part of the LLFS genome wide association study and was typed via the Illumina HumanOmni 2.5 at the Center for Inherited Disease Research at Johns Hopkins University. Participants were classified by the presence or absence of the APOE ε4 and ε2 alleles, and as carrying 1 or more G alleles at rs2075650.

In the United States, each field center used Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services lists to mail a recruitment brochure to people who were at least 79 years old on January 1, 2005; had no recorded date of death; did not have end-stage renal disease or were not in hospice programs; and lived within 3 hours driving distance of 1 of the 3 US study centers (Boston University, Columbia University, and the University of Pittsburgh). Mailings were per- formed in collaboration with Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the National Institute on Aging via an Intra-Agency Agreement. Study participants were also recruited from the community using Web-based media and newspaper advertise- ments, mailing lists obtained through local government agencies, purchased public domain lists from various commercial vendors, and community presentations at churches and senior centers. The University of Southern Denmark study site first identified individ- uals who would be aged 90 and older during the study recruitment period through the Danish National Register of Persons, which contains current information on names, including past names such as maiden names for women, addresses, place of birth, marriages, and vital status (Pedersen et al., 2006). Second, using information on the place of birth and the names, parish registers available in regional archives were searched to locate the parents of the elderly individuals in order to identify sibships. Based on the above infor- mation, potentiallyeligible families were identified and contact was made with potential probands to further assess the family’s eligi- bility for and willingness to participate in the LLFS using criteria parallel to that used in the United States. Recruitment, informed consent, and study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating sites.

2.4. Statistical analysis

Weinberg Equilibrium using the Haploview program (Barrett, 2009; Barrett et al., 2005) and we did not find deviations of geno- type frequencies from HardyeWeinberg Equilibrium for any of the SNPs. To minimize population stratification, analysis was restricted to subjects of white ethnicity, resulting in the loss of 8 spouses (1%) and 5 relatives (0.2%) from the analysis. We used logistic regression procedures in generalized estimating equations to estimate the likelihood of carrying 1 or more APOE ε4 alleles, 1 or more APOE ε2 alleles, or 1 or more rs2075650 G alleles in TOMM40. Generalized estimating equations adjusts for the relatedness of the LLFS offspring and controls and for the possibility that the characteristics of family members are correlated by both shared genetics and shared environment, by treating family membership as a cluster. LLFS offspring were compared with spouse controls, adjusting for age, sex, level of education, and family membership (model A) and then adjusting for age, sex, level of education, family membership and a history myocardial infarction, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease (model B). In the offspring generation, only 2 people were reported as suffering from dementia, so we did not include dementia as a covariate for these analyses. SNPS inTOMM40 have been shown to be in linkage disequilibrium with the APOE ε4 allele and it has been suggested that rs2075650 might not have an

2.2. Eligibility and enrollment

The Family Longevity Selection Score (FLoSS) was developed by the LLFS study in order to rank longevity among families based on birth-year cohort survival probabilities of the proband and siblings (Sebastiani et al., 2009). On screening, a FLoSS of 7 or more was required for a family to be eligible. If a proband’s family was FLoSS- eligible, they also had to meet the following criteria: the proband

independent effect on longevity (Deelen et al., 2011; Nebel et al., 2011; Sebastiani et al., 2012). To examine this possibility we repeated the analysis for TOMM40 including APOE in the model as a covariate, and also among those with the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype.

3. Results

LLFS offspring and their spouse controls did not differ in mean age at assessment (60.5 vs. 60.9, respectively). The average number of years of education was slightly but significantly higher among LLFS offspring compared with spouse controls (12.6 vs. 12.1) (Table 1). LLFS offspring were also more likely to be female than spouse controls (57.7% vs. 47.3%) and less likely to have a history of hypertension (29.4% vs. 33.9%), but did not differ from spouse controls in the frequency of a history of myocardial infarction, history of stroke, diabetes, or Parkinson’s disease (Table 1).

model, the relationship between offspring and the likelihood of G allele was attenuated (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6e1.1) (data not shown). Among those with the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype, the likelihood of carrying 1 or more G alleles remained 30% lower in offspring than in controls (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5e1.05), but the difference was not statistically significant.

Compared with spouse controls, the likelihood of carrying 1 or more ε4 alleles was 25% lower among LLFS offspring (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6e0.9), adjusting for age, sex, education, and family membership and did not change when the additional covariates were added to the model (Table 2, model A and model B). When the presence or absence of the G allele in rs2075650 of TOMM40 was added to the model, the relationship between offspring and the likelihood of G allele was attenuated (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7e1.2) (data not shown). Compared with spouse controls, the likelihood of carrying 1 or more ε2 alleles was 50% higher among offspring (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1e1.9), adjusting for covariates (Table 2, model A, model B).

4. Discussion

Overall, we found that the likelihood of carrying an APOE ε4 allele was lower and the likelihood of carrying an APOE ε2 allele was higher among LLFS family members in the offspring generation than among similarly aged spouse controls. These findings support the hypotheses that the absence of the ε4 allele and presence of the ε2 allele are associated with longevity. Adjustment for common

We confirmed findings from previous studies that rs2075650 in TOMM40 is in moderate linkage disequilibrium with the APOE ε4 allele (Fig. 1). Compared with spouse controls, the likelihood of carrying 1 or more G alleles was 30% lower among LLFS offspring (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.6e0.9), adjusting for covariates (Table 3, model A, model B).

4.1. Conclusions

Our findings support the hypothesis that reduction in the frequency of the ε4 allele, and an increase in the frequency of the ε2 allele contribute to longevity. The decreased allelic frequency of the ε4 allele, increased frequency of the ε2 allele, and decreased frequency of the rs2075650 G allele in TOMM40 in LLFS family members compared with controls, and similarities or discrepancies in these associations in other studies suggests the need for follow- up functional studies to better understand the role of these genetic factors and their interactions with other genetic and environmental factors in survival to extreme old age.

age-related, potentially confounding conditions, including stroke, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease did not change the pattern of results.

Previous studies have reported lower APOE ε4 allele frequencies in older compared with younger cohorts (Davignon et al., 1988; Kervinen et al.,1994; Rebeck et al.,1994; Schachter et al., 1994; van Bockxmeer, 1994), suggesting that the ε4 allele increases risk for mortality. In this study, we found a lower APOE ε4 allele frequency in a relatively young cohort of offspring of long-lived individuals, before substantial mortality has occurred: thus the reduced frequency of the ε4 allele in the oldest old might not be due to early mortality but to a heritable lower frequency of the risk allele, reducing risk for APOE-related disease. Previous studies have sug- gested that the APOE ε2 allele is associated with longevity, although inconsistently (Hirose et al, 1997; Louhija et al., 1994; Schachter et al., 1994). We also observed a significantly higher frequency of the ε2 allele in offspring of long-lived individuals, consistent with an association of the ε2 allele and longevity in the parent genera- tion. In some studies of older cohorts, however, including studies of Canadian British, and Italian elders, and a randomly chosen Han Chinese population, the frequency of the ε2 allele was similar in the older and younger cohorts, and the frequency of the ε4 allele was not consistently lower in the older cohort (Bader et al., 1998; Davignon et al.,1988; Galinsky et al.,1997; Jian-Gang et al.,1998). In the multiethnic Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) cohort, mortality risks associated with APOE genotype differed significantly by ethnic group (Lee et al., 2001). These differences underscore the importance of taking ethnicity into account when interpreting associations of genetic data with specific phenotypes and suggest that the effect of APOE risk alleles is likely to be influenced by other genetic and environmental factors. We also found that the frequency and likelihood of carrying a G allele in rs2075650 of TOMM40 was lower among offspring in the

We also found that the frequency and likelihood of carrying a G allele in rs2075650 of TOMM40 was lower among offspring in the LLFS, compared with the likelihood in married-in controls. Recent genome wide association studies in German, Dutch, Danish, and US Caucasian cohorts of long-lived individuals identified rs2075650 in TOMM40 as associated with longevity (Deelen et al., 2011 ; Nebel et al., 2011; Sebastiani et al., 2012), but also close to and in linkage disequilibrium with the rs429358, the APOE ε4 allele, and the investigators suggested that rs2075650 might not have an independent effect on longevity. Consistent with these analyses, we found that the addition of the ε4 allele to our models attenuated the association between offspring and the likelihood of carrying the G allele. When the analysis was restricted to those with the APOE ε3/ ε3 genotype, the association of offspring with the likelihood of carrying the G allele was not attenuated, but failed to reach statistical significance. Replication of this association in other long- lived cohorts will be needed to elucidate these results.
