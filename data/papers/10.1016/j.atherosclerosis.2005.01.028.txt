Abstract

Inflammatory response genes may influence life span or quality at advanced ages. Using data from the population-based cardiovascular study (CHS) cohort, we examined the associations between promoter polymorphisms of several inflammation and thrombosis genes longevity. We ascertained genotypes for interleukin (IL)-6 −174 G/C, (cid:1)-fibrinogen −455 G/A, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 4G/5G, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) −438 G/A in 2224 men and women ≥65 years old at baseline. During 10 of follow-up, men with the TAFI −438 A/A genotype had decreased mortality due to all causes, and lived, on average, 0.9 more years life, or 1.1 more years of healthy life, than men with the −438 G allele. The effects of TAFI −438 G/A in women were smaller and not significant. PAI-1 4G/4G genotype appeared to be associated with lower non-cardiovascular mortality in men, but with greater mortality in women. In exploratory analyses, we observed a possible interaction among anti-inflammatory drugs, interleukin-6 C/C genotype, and longevity. These findings suggest that modulators of fibrinolytic activity may have a generalized influence on aging, merit further investigation in studies of genetic determinants of human longevity.

Genetic factors appear to influence mortality, even at ad- vanced ages [1,2]. Inflammation, an evolutionarily conserved stress response, may reduce the length or quality of life in older adults by affecting adaptation to stressful events, chronic diseases, or the rate of aging. In case–control studies

provide complete mortality follow-up. For the current anal- ysis, we used complete 10-year follow-up data on all par- ticipants (corresponding to June 2000 for the original CHS cohort and June 2002 for the second CHS cohort).

of exceptional survival, inflammation and thrombosis gene promoter variants were associated with longevity, often, in a − sex-specific manner [3–5]. For example, the 174 C allele of interleukin-6 was more common among male, but not female, centenarians,comparedtoyounger,sex-matchedcontrols[4]. These retrospective studies of longevity have several limita- tions. The comparison group is sampled from another birth cohort, whose environmental exposures may differ from the long-lived case group. In addition, observed differences in case–control genotype or allele frequency may reflect sur- vival due to association with a single, common age-related condition such as coronary heart disease, rather than any in- fluence on the aging process per se.

Primary endpoints for this analysis included “years of life”, as well as “years of healthy life”, defined as the num- ber of years the person reported being in excellent, very good or good health in the 10 years after enrolment [7,8]. This outcome was derived from standard information on self-rated health status (excellent/very good/good/fair/poor) collected at baseline and every 6 months during follow- up. Missing data were imputed by linear interpolation of the available longitudinal data recorded 6 months before and after the missing value [7,8]. For the 3% of subjects whose final 10-year follow-up measurement was still miss- ing, we used the ‘last observation carried forward’ method of imputation.

Longitudinal cohort studies may allow more accurate as- sessment of genetic influences on longevity because both cause-specific and overall mortality can be ascertained. We therefore performed an analysis of genotype data available £ for promoter polymorphisms of interleukin-6, -fibrinogen, PAI-1, and TAFI on a sub-sample of participants from the car- diovascular health study (CHS; for details see Appendix A), a U.S. cohort of white and black men and women 65 years and older. After 10 years of follow-up, we assessed sex-specific associations of these gene variants with outcomes that reflect overall longevity (as years of life), life span and quality of life (as years of healthy life), and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Finally, we explored potential interactions of in- flammation genotypes with other common risk factors that influence inflammatory responses, such as cigarette smok- ing, obesity, and selected medications.

1.3. Participant sampling and laboratory assays

Genotyping assays were performed on blood drawn at baseline for a subset of 2334 CHS participants who were sampled as part of a nested case–control study of incident cardiovascular events [9,10], and who gave informed con- sent to DNA preparation and testing. We excluded nine sub- jects whose self-reported race was other than white or black. Another 101 participants (80 whites and 21 blacks) were ex- cluded because an adequate DNA sample was unavailable at the time of testing. Therefore, a total of 2224 partici- pants (1874 whites and 350 blacks) were included in the cur- − rent analyses. Genotyping for the interleukin-6 174 G/C, − − − PAI-1 675 4G/5G, fibrinogen 455 G/A, and TAFI 438 G/A polymorphisms was performed with standard methods [9–12].

1. Methods

1.1. Study subjects

The cardiovascular health study is a prospective population-based cohort study of 5888 older adult men and women recruited from four U.S. field centers: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylva- nia [6]. Those eligible to participate included all persons 65 years of age or older living in the household of each individual sampled. The original cohort (n = 5201) was recruited from 1989to1990.Asecondcohort(n = 687)ofAfrican-American participants was recruited between 1992 and 1993. All pro- cedures were conducted under institutionally approved pro- tocols for use of human subjects, and all subjects provided written informed consent.

Because available genotype data were from a case–control sample nested within the cohort, we weighted the data for each participant according to the reciprocal of his or her known sampling probability. Adjustment for sampling prob- ability recreates the frequency distribution of each case and control group in the entire cohort, thereby giving unbiased es- timates of genotype–longevity risk [13]. To obtain unbiased confidenceintervals(CI)andtestsofsignificance,weusedthe Huber–White (sandwich) method, as implemented in Stata 8.0 (College Station, TX) [14]. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by performing Pearson’s Chi-squared test us- ing the genotype distributions estimated for the entire cohort, but re-weighted a second time according to the case–control sample size, in order to more closely approximate the true sampling variance.

Clinical events, including fatal events due to all causes, were adjudicated by physician review panel according to medical records, death certificates, supplemented by Medi- care utilization data. We used the National Death Index to

All primary analyses were performed stratified by sex and by race. To assess associations of genotype with the continu- ous outcome variables (years of life, years of healthy life), we

used multiple linear regression, adjusted for age at baseline and clinic site. In two additional regression models, we also adjustedforbaselinehealthstatus(self-ratedhealth,smoking, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes), or indicators of socioeconomic status (years of education, in- come, and marital status). The associations of genotype with mortality (overall and cause-specific) were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models [15].

After 10 years of follow-up, there were 918 deaths, in- cluding 451 cardiovascular deaths (303 from coronary heart disease) and 467 non-cardiovascular deaths (156 from can- ± cer). The mean ( S.D.) number of years lived per subject ± during those 10 years was 8.32 2.69; the mean number of ± healthy years was 6.07 3.43. Age, male sex, black race, baseline fair or poor self-reported health status, smoking, di- abetes, obesity, hypertension, and history of cardiovascular disease were strongly associated with fewer years of life and fewer years of healthy life (all P < 0.001).

Subjects having the most common genotype served as the reference group, unless otherwise noted. Covariate-adjusted P-values for genetic main effects were calculated from the composite Wald test for indicator variables corresponding to the two minor genotypes. Because our primary hypotheses required performing multiple, independent tests of four un- ≤ linked genes, P-values 0.01 were considered statistically significant.

Except for TAFI 438 G/A, the variant promoter alle- les were less common among blacks than whites (Table 2). Genotype distributions did not differ significantly according to other baseline health-related variables such as obesity, hy- pertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and fair or poor health status (all P > 0.10).

In hypothesis-generating analyses, we explored the in- teractions of inflammatory response genotypes with three risk factors that influence inflammation: cigarette smoking, obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2), and baseline use of any medication having anti-inflammatory properties (aspirin, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, or statins). Models were adjusted for sex, sex-by-genotype interaction, baseline cardiovascu- lar disease, current smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. P- values for interaction were calculated from Wald tests for the cross-product interaction terms. Because of the exploratory nature of these analyses, we set statistical significance at P ≤ 0.05.

Among white participants, the alleles of the TAFI − 438 G/A polymorphism deviated significantly from Hardy– Weinberg proportions (Table 2). The Hardy–Weinberg dis- equilibrium was strongly present among men (P = 0.0007), but not among women (P = 0.26). When adjusted for mul- tiple comparisons, the disequilibrium remained signifi- cant (P-values 0.03 overall, 0.01 in white men). Possible, but less extreme, deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equi- librium were noted for the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism

2. Results

Years of life and years of healthy life differed by TAFI pro- moter genotypes among white men (Table 3), but there was little association of TAFI genotype with longevity in women (Table 4). The association with years of life in men remained significant in analyses that also adjusted for baseline socioe- conomic (P = 0.007) or health-related variables (P = 0.003); similar results were seen for years of healthy life (P = 0.01 after adjustment for socioeconomic variables; P = 0.02 after adjustment for health-related variables). During 10 years of − follow-up, men carrying the TAFI 438 A/A genotype had 0.9 additional years of life (95% CI 0.2–1.9 years) or 1.1 additional years of healthy life (95% CI 0.2–2.1 years) rel- − ative to men carrying at least one common TAFI 438 G allele.

3. Discussion

The primary finding of this longitudinal population-based study of older adults is the association of a common TAFI − promoter genotype, 438 A/A, with increased longevity in men. In contrast, we observed little association between TAFI promoter genotype and longevity in women. The restriction of the observed association to individuals homozygous for the rare TAFI allele and only men may suggest the possibil- ity of a false-positive association due to type 1 error. On the other hand, gender-specific genetic influences on longevity have been reported in both humans [1–5] and rodents [16]. In addition, TAFI promoter genotypes of our male study partic- ipants deviated significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilib- rium, a finding previously noted among healthy middle-aged men of European descent [17]. The excess homozygosity of − the TAFI 438 A allele we observed in men at baseline rein- force the possibility of an age- and sex-specific influence of TAFI genotype on survival.

TAFI is a pro-carboxypeptidase that regulates the bal- ance between coagulation and fibrinolysis by removing the C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin clots [18]. The associ- ation of TAFI genotype with longevity in older men raises the possibility that TAFI may influence aging beyond its effects on thrombosis, especially since the risk reduction associated with the TAFI promoter genotype was not limited to cardio- vascular mortality. Activated TAFI can cleave a broad range of substrates, including complement proteins, kinins, and os- teopontin, and thus may be involved in several acute inflam- matory and stress responses, including vasomotor stability, vascular permeability, cellular adhesion, leukocyte chemo- taxis, and wound healing [19,20].

Risk estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for race, clinic site, and birth cohort. CVD: cardiovascular disease; CHD: coronary heart disease.

The 438 A allele of the TAFI gene promoter has been associated with decreased circulating levels of TAFI anti- gen in the current study sample of older adults [12] and in other population samples [21]. We similarly observed that in men, but not in women, TAFI antigen levels in the low- est quartile were associated with greater number of years, or healthy years, lived during follow-up (unpublished observa- − tions). The 438 A allele also is in strong linkage disequi- librium with a common Thr325Ile substitution that increases the thermal stability and anti-fibrinolytic activity of activated TAFI [22]. Therefore, the apparent beneficial association of − TAFI 438 A/A genotype on longevity might result from increased fibrinolytic activity due to lower circulating TAFI levels, increased anti-inflammatory activity due to enhanced TAFI proteolysis of inflammatory substrates, or both.

smoking status or obesity with inflammation genotypes in predicting longevity phenotypes. A possible drug–gene in- teraction was observed for the interleukin-6 promoter poly- morphism and inflammation-modulating medication use on all-cause mortality (P-value for interaction = 0.02) and years of healthy life (P-value for interaction = 0.06). After adjust- ing for baseline cardiovascular disease and risk factors, anti- inflammatory medication use was associated with reduced all-cause mortality (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.42–1.10) and in- creased years of healthy life (+0.5 years, 95% CI +0.2 to +1.2 years) among subjects with the − 174 C/C genotype. In contrast, among carriers of the common − 174 G allele, anti- inflammatory medication use appeared to be associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.98–1.47) and fewer years of healthy life (− 0.5 years, 95% CI − 0.1 to − 0.9 years).

Evolutionarily, inflammation and tissue repair are likely to protect against infectious diseases and promote wound heal- ing, thereby ensuring reproductive fitness. Both TAFI and PAI-1 genotype affect survival in children with meningo- coccal infection [23,24]. Thus, common variants of genes that regulate inflammation or fibrin deposition may repre- sent an example of ‘antagonistic pleiotropy’, in which an attribute that is beneficial during childhood and the repro- ductive years (such as a robust inflammatory or hemostatic

Confir- mation of our findings would have important implications for variability in the inter-individual response to drug ther- apy among older adults.

response) subsequently reduces the length or quality of life in older adults. During the 19th and 20th centuries, advances in medicine and public health and improved living standards led to greatly improved childhood health and survival along with reduced chronic infections and inflammation. On the basis of cohort-specific adult mortality trends, along with the association of early-age mortality and subsequent mortality, it has been hypothesized that reduction in lifetime exposure to infectious diseases and other sources of inflammation may have contributed to the historical decline in old-age mortal- ity [25]. Sex-related differences in immune function and in- fectious disease susceptibility may also explain in part the shorter life span of men compared to women [26].

In summary, a common promoter variant of the TAFI gene, and perhaps also the PAI-1 gene, may be associated with longevity in older men. These findings suggest that modu- lators of fibrinolytic activity or proteolysis may have a gen- eralized influence on aging or age-related disease, and merit further investigation in studies of genetic determinants of hu- man longevity. Examination of additional TAFI gene vari- ants, such as Thr325Ile, or multi-locus haplotypes, may be required to define more precisely the location of any func- tional longevity-associated allele(s). Interactions with addi- tional life style factors and interventions, as well as other gene pathways related to vascular disease and aging (oxida- tive and metabolic responses, insulin signaling) also may be appropriate for future study.

Our results for the PAI-1 promoter polymorphism were confusing, and may just be due to chance. The 4G/4G geno- type appeared to be associated with lower non-cardiovascular mortality in men, but with greater cardiovascular mortality in women. Smaller population studies examining the PAI-1 pro- moter polymorphism have also showed conflicting results. The 4G allele was associated with increased longevity in an Italian centenarian case–control study, but a gender-specific was not noted [3]. There was no association between PAI-1 genotype in Danish centenarians [27], nor in a German oc- togenarian cohort [28]. The PAI-1 4G/5G variant has been shown to be functional in vitro [29,30]. The 4G sequence abolishes a binding site for a transcription repressor, thereby resulting in higher promoter activity and increased plasma levels of PAI-1 in vivo. In rodent models, the induction of PAI-1 expression in response to stress, and the age-related increase in magnitude of this response, influences the occur- rence of vascular and tissue thrombosis [31,32]. These ex- perimental findings might explain the trend toward increased cardiovascular mortality associated with the 4G/4G genotype observed here and by others [33,34].

Increased levels of plasma fibrinogen predict total mortal- ity in CHS [35] as well other cohort studies of older adults [36]. Nonetheless, we and others did not observe an associ-  ation with longevity for the -fibrinogen promoter polymor- phism. The negative findings may reflect the relatively small portion of the overall variance in fibrinogen level explained − by the 455 G/A polymorphism [37].

Increased plasma IL-6 levels have been associated with age-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in older adults. − In older men, the IL-6 promoter 174 G/G genotype was as- sociated with increased IL-6 levels and decreased longevity [4,38]. Other case–control studies of long-lived individuals reported conflicting results [39,40]. Overall, we observed a non-significant trend toward increased longevity associated − with the IL-6 174 C allele. The possible interaction of anti- − inflammatory drugs and interleukin-6 174 C/C genotype on mortality and years of healthy life should be interpreted cautiously. These data were derived from exploratory anal- yses uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Nonetheless, a − similar interaction between statins and interleukin-6 174 C/C in reducing cardiovascular risk has been reported [41]. The C/C genotype is associated with higher plasma levels of
