al. (2012) investigated the association of TERT SNPs with longevity in the general Danish population, but did not find any significant association. In this study, we investigated the association of the functional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) MNS16A of TERT with longevity in a population from Central Italy. MNS16A genotypes were determined for 1072 unrelated healthy individuals from Central Italy aged between 18 and 106 years old, divided into three gender-specific age classes based on demographic information and accounting for different survival rates between men and women. The first class consisted of individuals below 66 years old (below 73 years old for women), the second class consisted of individuals between 66 and 88 years old (between 73 and 91 years old for women), and the third class consisted of individuals above 88 years old (above 91 years old for women). TL was assessed using genomic DNA from whole blood of 72 selected individuals by a multiplex real-time PCR assay. The results showed that MNS16A is associated with longevity, with significant associations in Comparison 2 (Age Class 3 vs. Age Class 2) under both additive (odds ratio [O.R.] 0.749; p = 0.019) and dominant (O.R. 0.579; p = 0.011) models. The MNS16A*L allele is significantly underrepresented in Age Class 3 (O.R. 0.759; p = 0.020) compared to Age Class 2. A significant telomere attrition is reported along the three age classes (p = 0.0001), which remains significant only in L*/L* genotype carriers (p = 0.002) when the analysis was conducted according to MNS16A genotype. The TERT MNS16A*L allele appears negatively associated with longevity, and the concomitant significant telomere cross-sectional attrition rate observed for L*/L* genotype suggests that this polymorphism could influence human longevity by affecting TL. The study was approved by the Joint Ethical Committee (JEC) University of Camerino-Azienda ASUR Marche ZT-10 Camerino, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in its revised edition and with international and local regulatory requirements.text population, to investigate the association of TERT VNTR MNS16A with telomere length. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a standardized salting-out method, and stored at -20°C until gene analysis. TERT VNTR MNS16A was genotyped using an allele-specific PCR method with a primer set and PCR Master Mix (2) (Fermentas). The amplification procedure consisted of an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 minutes. Each sample was genotyped in duplicate. The PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.25 mg/ml of ethidium bromide, and genotypes were assigned as L*/L*, S*/L* and S*/S*. 

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of TERT gene with human longevity by analyzing the functional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) MNS16A. We conducted a cross-sectional study on a population from Central Italy, comprising of Caucasian individuals divided into three gender-specific age classes. A total of 1072 unrelated individuals aged between 18-106 years were recruited from the Marche region of Central Italy. The subjects provided information regarding their health condition to ensure that no pathological condition existed. The population was divided into three sex-specific age classes: for men [women], the first class consists of [missing information]; the second class consists of [missing information]; and the third class consists of [missing information]. 

To investigate the association of TERT VNTR MNS16A with telomere length, we selected a total of 72 samples (age-, sex- and genotype-matched) from the population. LTL was measured using monochrome multiplex Real-Time Quantitative PCR, which measures the relative amount of telomeric DNA (T) as compared to the amount of a single copy gene DNA (S) in the same sample (T/S ratio). The MNS16A genotypes were distributed as L*/L*, S*/L* and S*/S* and their distribution along the three age classes did not change significantly. However, significant associations of TERT VNTR MNS16A were found in Comparison 2 (Age Class 3 vs. Age Class 2) under both additive and dominant models. The MNS16A*L allele was significantly underrepresented in Age Class 3 compared to Age Class 2.in human longevity has been suggested by previous studies (Atzmon et al., 2010; Bernardes de Jesus et al., 2012). In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of MNS16A genotype on telomere length (LTL) and its association with human longevity.

We analyzed a population and expressed the results as a T/S ratio. The mean T/S ratio was 1.111 ± 0.290, ranging from 0.683 to 1.833, and it followed a normal distribution in the study population (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p = 0.153). We did not notice a significant difference between the sexes (females, 1.099 ± 0.283; males 1.124 ± 0.301; p = 0.721). As expected, LTL showed a significant age-dependent cross-sectional decrease (Age Class 1, mean T/S = 1.315 ± 0.298; Age Class 2, mean T/S = 1.029 ± 0.256; Age Class 3, mean T/S = 1.011 ± 0.223; p = 0.0001) (Fig. 2). LTL did not differ among the three MNS16A genotype groups (Table 2). However, the LTL attrition along the three age classes was significant only for MNS16A L*/L* genotype carriers (p = 0.002) (Table 2).

Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated using the genotype counting method, and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was assessed by comparing the genotype frequencies with the expected values using a contingency table 2 statistics. We tested genotype association under additive, dominant, and recessive models and employed Cochran-Armitage test of trend for the additive model. We used Pearson's 2 or Fisher's exact test (when expected is <5) to evaluate the dominant model (L*/L* + L*/S* vs. S*/S*), recessive model (L*/L* vs. L*/S* + S*/S*), and allelic association. We expressed the strength of association as odds ratios (O.R.s) with 95% confidence intervals.

For LTL measures, we assessed the normality of distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, while we analyzed differences between study groups using one-way ANOVA. We expressed data as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). We regarded two-tailed probability values of less than 0.05 as statistically significant. We did not perform Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing since we were assessing specific questions on a gene previously tested for association with human longevity, and we were not searching for associations without a priori hypotheses (Pernerger, 1998).

During the last decades, several studies have demonstrated a strong link between telomere length and human lifespan (Barrett and Richardson, 2011; Gomes et al., 2011). Telomere length shortens with age, leading to senescence, apoptosis, or oncogenic transformation of somatic cells, affecting the health and lifespan of an individual. Shorter telomeres have also been associated with increased incidence of diseases and poor survival (Shammas, 2011). Thus, recent studies attempted to uncover the role of telomere maintenance genes (TERT and TERC) in human longevity.

In this study, we provide novel evidence for TERT in longevity by showing that the L* allele at VNTR MNS16A of the TERT gene influences negatively life expectancy. This result was further supported by the significant LTL attrition that we found along the three age classes, for L*/L* genotype carriers only. Several association studies of MNS16A in cancer can further help us to address its role in human longevity. A survival analysis on 299 non-Hispanic white patients with glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated that L* carriers have a worse survival duration compared to S*/S* genotype carriers (Wang et al., 2006). L*/L* genotype carriers were also found to display a worse overall survival in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (Jin et al., 2011). On the other side, the S* allele seems to confer an increased risk for glioma (Carpentier et al., 2007), breast cancer (Wang et al., 2008), colorectal cancer (Hofer et al., 2011), and lung cancer (Jin et al., 2011). Thus, these findings may suggest that the MNS16A*S allele is a sort of double-edgedIn complex traits, the association of VNTR in the INS gene with type-1 diabetes (Julier et al., 1991), the VNTRs located in the SLC6A3 and SLC6A4 genes with several psychiatric conditions (Ueno, 2003), and the VNTRs in SIRT3 and APOB genes with human longevity (Bellizzi et al., 2005; De Benedictis et al., 1998) has been previously demonstrated. Although we found LTL attrition along the three age classes (p = 0.0001), it remains significant only in L*/L* genotype carriers (p = 0.002) when the analysis was conducted according to MNS16A genotype. This result should be taken with caution due to limited sample size. Moreover, it should be noted that the difference between the average LTL among the two elderly groups (Age Class 2 and Age Class 3) (Table 2 and Fig. 2) seems insignificant, indeed appearing unchanged. This fact is supported by several studies that reported the leveling off of telomere length in advanced age groups (Ishikawa et al., 2012), the dependence of LTL on the health status of centenarians (Terry et al., 2008), and the lack of association of LTL with overall survival or lifespan in elderly persons (Njajou et al., 2009), respectively.

It has been reported that VNTR MNS16A affects the putative promoter region of the antisense transcript of TERT, giving rise to a potential allele-dependent regulation of telomerase expression (Wang et al., 2003). Longer alleles at MNS16A exhibit stronger promoter activity compared to shorter alleles (Wang et al., 2003). This leads to an increased expression of antisense TERT mRNA with a conceivable, at least partial, silencing of sense telomerase transcript (Wang et al., 2003). Accordingly, carriers of the MNS16A*S allele should be noted. It is noteworthy that some TERT polymorphisms correlate to telomere length but do not affect longevity or the parameters of healthy aging (Soerensen et al., 2012). This is probably due to the great environmental component affecting telomere length. Oxidative stress, depression, and uncertainty for the future have been found to significantly correlate with shorter telomeres (Cherkas et al., 2006; Epel et al., 2004; Lung et al., 2007; Yen and Lung, 2013). Thus, environmental factors play a significant role.

may affect telomere length and longevity more than the genetic background in populations (such as the Italian population), where a great social and economic variability is present (De Rango et al., 2011). In certain restricted groups (such as Ashkenazi Jews from New York Atzmon et al., 2010), where environmental variability is lower,the genetic variation of telomerase may have a greater impact on aging and longevity. Further studies using larger sample size and detailed environmental variables (e.g. smoking, working and educational status) are warranted to clearly address the genetic contribution of TERT polymorphisms in determining LTL and human longevity. In particular, it should be noted that the significance of our data on MNS16A genotype and allele frequencies would not survive a multiple comparison correction if applied. This fact, together with the lack of association of LTL across MNS16A genotypes (within age classes), further highlights the need for a replication study using another population and a bigger sample size.
