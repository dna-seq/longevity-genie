Human longevity is heritable with a genetic component of 25–32%. Variation in genes regulating the levels of somatic maintenance and DNA repair functions is thought to modulate the aging process and to contribute to survival at advanced age. We tested 92 non-synonymous SNPs in 49 DNA repair genes for a possible association with longevity in a sample of 395 German centenarians and 411 controls. The obtained association signal in exonuclease 1 (EXO1) was further investigated by fine mapping and mutation detection, leading to the identification of the functionally relevant SNP rs1776180. Our detailed analyses revealed that the C allele of this promoter SNP is significantly enriched in female centenarians. This finding replicated in 455 female French centenarians and 109 controls. The C allele leads to the loss of a binding site for the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor E47, resulting in higher EXO1 expression. Thus, we have detected a hitherto undescribed role for E47 as a negative regulator of EXO1 transcription and a genetic variant in the EXO1 promoter that counteracts the E47- mediated repression of the gene. Given the survival advantage that is associated with the C allele of rs1776180, EXO1 can be considered a candidate for a novel longevity-enabling gene.

resolve DNA damage have evolved as highly conserved longevity assurance mechanisms (Hasty, 2005). Another line of evidence that links DNA repair with aging is that many of the human progeria disorders, such as Werner Syndrome, are caused by mutations in genes involved in DNA maintenance (reviewed by Hasty, 2005). Similarly, studies of mouse models show that genetic defects affecting genomic integrity underlie several of the accelerated aging phenotypes (Hasty, 2005; Lombard et al., 2005).

1. Introduction

There is increasing evidence that somatic mutations progres- sively accumulate with age in various species, including humans (Hasty et al., 2003; Vijg, 2000). A wide range of exogenous agents (e.g. UV-radiation) and by-products of cellular metabolism (e.g. reactive oxygen species) are known to harm genetic material. In addition, mutations can arise from spontaneous replication errors (Hasty, 2005). Since DNA damage may result in dysregulated cellular processes, apoptosis, oncogenic transformation, genomic instability and senescence, maintenance systems are critical for both cellular and organismal homeostasis and survival (Lombard et al., 2005). Therefore, numerous pathways that either prevent or

These findings support the notion that variation in genes regulating the levels of somatic maintenance and DNA repair functions could also modulate the normal aging process and contribute to longevity (Kirkwood, 2005). In humans, it is conceivable that the more efficient these survival mechanisms are, the more likely would an individual be to attain old age in good physical and cognitive condition, leading not only to an increase in their life span but also in their ‘health span’. In fact, it has been postulated that long-lived individuals, who are often characterized by a decelerated aging process and a delayed onset of age-related diseases (Hitt et al., 1999), are enriched for favourable variants in longevity-enabling genes compared to younger controls (Perls

et al., 2002). A recent twin study strengthens this hypothesis by showing that the overall genetic contribution (25–32%) to human life expectancy is minimal before the age of 60, but becomes particularly important for survival at a very advanced age (Hjelmborg et al., 2006). So far, variation in only two genes, apolipoprotein E (APOE) (Christensen et al., 2006) and forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A) (Anselmi et al., 2009; Flachsbart et al., 2009; Willcox et al., 2008), has been found to be repeatedly associated with longevity in different populations.

http://www.R-project.org/), adjusting for APOE. Interaction analysis of EXO1 SNP rs1776180 with the TCF3 SNPs was also performed by logistic regression. Furthermore, besides the additive model for the genotypes the two possible dominant-recessive models were also regarded. They yielded no significant improvement over the additive model and are thus not presented in our results. P values smaller than 0.05 were considered nominally statistically significant. If adjustmentformultipletestingwasconsidered,theBonferronimethod wasapplied.

2.5. Mutation detection

Sequencing of the exons, intron–exon boundaries and the promoter region of EXO1 was done in 46 centenarians with the BigDye1 Chemistry (Applied Biosystems) (for primer sequences, see Table S6). The EXO1promoter was localized

In the present study, we tested a total of 92 non-synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) in 49 DNA repair genes for a possible association with the advanced longevity phenotype. Our strategy was to derive a genetic association signal, to identify the mechanistically relevant polymorphism(s) and to subject these variants to genetic replication (Fig. 1A). We identified a candidate for a novel susceptibility locus for prolonged life expectancy, the gene encoding exonuclease 1 (EXO1). EXO1 participates in various DNA metabolic pathways affecting genomic stability, including homologous recombination and DNA damage repair (Liberti and Rasmussen, 2004; Qiu et al., 1999). Our detailed functional and genetic analyses revealed a common allele in the promoter of the gene that is enriched in female centenarians and that enhances EXO1 expression via differential binding of the transcription factor E47. Finally, the association between the functional SNP and longevity is replicated in an independent population of female French centenarians and controls.

2.1. Study participants

The German DNA collections and the recruitment procedures were reported in detail elsewhere (Nebel et al., 2005). The case sample comprised 395 centenarians (100–110yearsatascertainment;meanage:101.3years);79%ofthemwerefemale. Thecentenarianswerespecificallymatchedtoagroupof411youngercontrols(60–75 years;meanage:66.6years)intermsofancestry,genderandgeographicoriginwithin Germany (Nebel et al., 2005), thus minimizing any systematic genetic differences between these samples that might arise due to very low levels of undetected population structure. The French sample set consisted of 455 female centenarians (meanage:103.7years)and109femalecontrols(60–70years;meanage:64.5years) as described previously (Blanche´ et al., 2001). All subjects gave written informed consentpriortoparticipation.Thestudywasapprovedbytherespectiveinstitutional review committees of the participating centers.

2.2. Gene and cSNP selection

The investigated 92 coding SNPs (Table S1) are located in 49 genes involved (Hampe et al., 2007; http://cSNP.appliedbiosystems.com/, see link to SNPlexTM System cSNP Assay Index).

variants of EXO1 inserted into pDB20 vector by applying standard yeast transformation techniques. Three independent clones were generated for each construct. Clones containing empty expression vector served as negative control, yeast strain U687 (Drad51) deficient for rad51 but not for exo1 (Qiu et al., 1999) served as specificity control. Yeast cells were spread on growth plates, exposed to different UV dosages ranging from 0 to 40 mJ/cm2 (UV-B light source; Phillips TL 20/W12, Eindhoven, Netherlands) and incubated at 30 8C for 48 h. The number of resulting colonies was counted and calculated as percentage of untreated controls.

2.6. Construction of plasmids

Plasmids for over-expression of human EXO1 protein in yeast cells were generatedbyinsertingfulllengthEXO1cDNAintoexpressionvectorpDB20(Becker et al., 1991). Constructs for analysis of EXO1 50-UTR were designed by insertion of a 584 bp fragment of the 50-UTR region into vector pGL3control (Promega, Madison, WI). Constructs for analysis of EXO1 50-proximal promoter were designed by inserting 1199 bp of the EXO1 promoter region into vector pGL3Enhancer (Promega).Allele-specificconstructswereestablishedbysite-directedmutagenesis using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The over- expression construct pMyc-E47-EYFP was kindly provided by Naihe Jing (Shanghai InstitutesforBiologicalSciences,Shanghai,China).ForRNAi-mediatedknock-down of E47/TCF3 expression, two independent target sequences directed against E47/ TCF3mRNAwereinsertedintovectorpSUPER.Neo + GFP(OligoEngine,Seattle,WA).

2.8. Cell culture and transfection

HumanembryonalkidneyHEK293(ACC305),cervicalcarcinomaHeLacells(ACC 57), human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 (ACC16) and human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells (AC282) were cultured under standard conditions. Transfec- tionswereperformedusingFugene6TM(Roche,Basel,Switzerland)accordingtothe manufacturer’s manual.

2.9. Dual luciferase assay

For quantitative analysis of the 50-UTR and 50-proximal promoter regions, pGL3 constructswereusedfordualluciferasereportergeneassay(Promega)asdescribed before (Till et al., 2005).

The UV-sensitive yeast strain FDER (Dexo1/Drad51) (Qiu et al., 1999) was used for generation of individual clones overexpressing the allele-specific

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The investigation of DNA repair genes represented the explorative stage of our study and served to identify markers for further genetic and functional follow-up and replication (Fig. 1A). For the associationanalyses, we applied an established longevity study design (Nebel et al., 2005) by comparing German centenarians (n = 395; aged 100–110 years) to younger controls (n = 411; aged 60–75years) that were matched by ancestry, gender and geographic origin within Germany.

A total of 123 lymphoblastoid cell lines were obtained from heparinized samples of unrelated healthy donors (from the Popgen Biobank) (Krawczak et 2006). DNA was genotyped for rs1776180 using a TaqMan1 SNP Genotyping (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Qiagen, Hilden, Real-time PCR was performed using a 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR-System Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Expression levels of EXO1 (assay were calculated with the standard curve method (Livak and Schmittgen, Significance was determined using the Mann–Whitney U-test.

The genetic markers were subjected to allelic (CCA) and genotypic (CCG) case–control comparisons. The cSNP with the lowest P , rs735943, was located in exon 10 of the EXO1 gene CCA (P = 8.16  10(cid:3)4 and P = 0.0012; Table 1). An additional CCA CCG association signal (rs4149965) was observed in exon 11 of the same gene (Table 1). Two other cSNPs located in different genes also showed nominally significant association with longevity, but since their P and P were much higher than those for CCA CCG the EXO1 cSNP rs735943 (Table S2), they were not studied any further. The P value of the EXO1 lead SNP rs735943 did not CCA pass correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni-adjusted P = 0.075; 92 tests). But as rs735943 was identified as the CCA top-ranking marker and was additionally supported by a second signal in a neighbouring exon, we performed an in-depth exploration of the EXO1 gene. This included mutation detection, fine mapping and functional studies to identify and verify the mechanistically relevant polymorphism(s) that would even- tually be subjected to genetic replication (Fig. 1A). Sequencing of all known exons, exon–intron boundaries and the promoter of EXO1 in 46 centenarians revealed several known and one novel mutation. In the subsequent fine mapping, tagging SNPs were considered as well as polymorphisms derived from the re- sequencing (i.e. cSNPs, SNPs located in the 50-UTR and further upstream region), using a total of 43 markers in the gene region (Table S3). Fourteen of these SNPs were significantly associated (Fig. 1B), and seven of these were located in potentially functional regions (Table 2 and Fig. 1C). The seven SNPs were in moderate to strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other (Fig. 1B). When analyzed separately by logistic regression with adjustment for the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), the only gene shown to have a large effect on longevity (OR for APOE see below), all of the seven SNPs exhibited a stronger effect than without adjustment (Table 2). No significant interaction was observed between any two SNPs or between a SNP and APOE. As expected, APOE alone showed a very strong association

Analysis of transcription factor binding sites

For analysis of EXO1 promoter regions containing the allelic variants at the SNPs thesequences wereanalyzedforpotentialtranscription binding sites using JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net/).

Preparation of nuclear extracts from human cell lines and bandshift assays were performed as previously described (Rosenstiel et al., 2003). The sequence of the oligonucleotides representing the allelic variants of the EXO1 promoter were EXO1P_rs1776180_C:50-CGGGCCGGCAGCAGCGGCTGCAGTCGTATGGCAGTGAGCC- GCTGTCTACC-30 and EXO1P_rs1776180_G: 50-CGGGCCGGCAGCAGCGGCTGGA- GTCGTATGGCAGTGAGCCGCTGTCTACC-30 (the affected nucleotide position is underlined). For detection of E47 protein in DNA-binding complexes, bandshift assays were performed as described, and DNA-bound protein complexes were blotted onto PVDF membrane and analyzed for E47 protein using specific anti-E47 antibody (‘Shift Western’).

3. Results

3.1. Investigation of cSNPs in DNA repair genes reveals EXO1 as a candidate gene

We tested 92 non-synonymous coding SNPs (cSNPs) in 49 selected DNA repair genes for a possible association with the longevity phenotype (Table S1). These SNPs represent the ‘DNA repair subset’ of a large panel of 19779 cSNPs described in detail elsewhere (Hampe et al., 2007). In our experiment, we only typed this ‘DNA repair subset’ using the SNPlexTM Genotyping System

Since allelic variants may potentially influence the longevity phenotype in men and women differently (Candore et al., 2006; Franceschi et al., 2000), we also performed a sex-stratified analysis. In men, no significant association was detected (data not shown). In women, all SNPs but one showed a stronger effect (Table 3) than in the analysis of both genders combined (Table 2).

In order to investigate the functional role of the two promoter SNPs rs1776181 and rs1776180, we established reporter gene constructs based on the four possible haplotypes (i.e. AG, GG, AC, GC, see Fig. 2A). Insertion of any promoter fragment increased reporter gene activity by a factor of up to 90 compared to the empty vector control. More importantly, our data indicate a

Exo1 nuclease is involved in various DNA metabolic pathways, e.g. homologous recombination and mismatch repair. Since human EXO1 protein can complement its yeast homologue in preventing DNA damage induced by UV-radiation (Qiu et al., 1999), complementation studies using UV-sensitive knock-out yeast strains represent a well-established experimental model to study EXO1 function. To assess the effect of the two EXO1 cSNPs, we over- expressed all four variants of human EXO1 protein (H354R substitution corresponding to rs735943; V458M substitution corresponding to rs4149965) in exo1-deficient UV-sensitive FDER yeast cells (Dexo1/Drad51). All EXO1 proteins in our study were able to desensitize these yeast cells from DNA damage-induced cell death. We observed no quantitative differences between the four protein variants in terms of their ability to protect yeast cells from UV-induced DNA damage (Fig. S1A and B). We conclude that the EXO1 cSNP alleles do not influence the ability to repair UV-induced DNA damage. Given the multiple roles of EXO1 in the maintenance of genomic stability, we cannot exclude the possibility that the two analyzed cSNPs may be functionally relevant in a different context. Nevertheless, bioinformatic analyses of the variants revealed no evidence for functional consequences at the level of enzymatic activity, protein phosphorylation status or domain integrity (not shown).

Fig. 2. The C allele of EXO1 SNP rs1776180 contributes to increased promoter activity.(A)DualluciferaseassayswithreportergeneconstructsrepresentingEXO1 promoter haplotypes were used to quantify promoter activity. HeLa cells were transfected and used for quantification of constitutive promoter activity. As vector control (vc), empty vector pGL3Enhancer was used. Haplotypes are based on the SNP order rs1776181 and rs1776180. Haplotype frequencies as observed in the control individuals are given below each column. Data are expressed as relative light units (RLU) and represent mean values + SD (n = 3). Both haplotypes containing the C allele of rs1776180 showed a 6–9-fold higher activity than the corresponding haplotypes carrying the G allele (**P < 0.01 for both comparisons), irrespective of the allele at rs1776181.

Real-time PCR was used to quantify the relative expression level of EXO1 mRNA in human lymphoblastoid cells in relation to the rs1776180 genotypes. Data represent the mRNA expression level of EXO1, normalized to housekeeping gene b-actin, box-plots represent the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile, all relative expression values are displayed individually. In females, genotype CC (n = 10, diamond) of rs1776180 is associated with a 1.34-fold higher relative EXO1 expression than genotype GG (n = 23, filled circle) and with a 1.45-fold higher relative EXO1 expression than genotype CG (n = 36, filled triangle). Significance was tested using the Mann–Whitney U-test (*P < 0.05).

3.3. 50-UTR haplotypes of EXO1 do not differentially influence reporter gene activity

To analyze the effect of the three SNPs located in the EXO1 50- UTR (rs1776178, rs1635517 and rs1776177), we inserted a 584 bp 50-UTR fragment in front of luciferase mRNA to create a heterologous reporter gene system. Using site-directed mutagen- esis, we established constructs representing the common UTR haplotypes that show a frequency >1% in the German control individuals (i.e. AGC, GGC, AGT, GAC and GAT, see Table S4). Comparison of the five 50-UTR haplotypes by dual luciferase assay in HeLa cells did not reveal any differential reporter gene levels (Fig. S2), indicating that none of the analyzed 50-UTR haplotypes influences post-transcriptional processing or translation efficiency of EXO1.

remarkable influence of the rs1776180 alleles on EXO1 promoter activity (Fig. 2A). Both haplotypes containing the C allele of rs1776180 showed a 6–9-fold higher activity than their G bearing counterpart (P < 0.01 for both comparisons). No significant difference in promoter activity was observed between the constructs carrying either allele of rs1776181. The C allele of rs1776180 is therefore most likely to enhance EXO1 promoter activity regardless of the rs1776181 allele. Interestingly, the C allele of rs1776180 was statistically significantly over-represented in centenarians (Table 2).

3.5. EXO1 mRNA level is up-regulated in females carrying the C allele of SNP rs1776180

The above-mentioned results prompted us to investigate promoter SNP-dependent EXO1 mRNA expression levels in human lymphoblastoid cell lines in relation to their rs1776180 genotype. No significant genotype-dependent EXO1 mRNA regulation was observed in cell lines originating from male individuals (P = 0.50; 17 CC vs. 15 GG genotypes; (cid:3)1.06-fold induction). In contrast, EXO1 transcript levels were significantly up-regulated (P = 0.03; 1.34-fold induction) in cell lines originating from females with the CC genotype (n = 10) when compared to women with the GG genotype (n = 23) and significantly up-regulated (P = 0.02; 1.45- fold induction) when compared to women with the genotype CG (n = 36; see real-time PCR data in Fig. 2B). These data support the notion of a female-specific functional effect, as already observed in the genetic analysis (Table 3).

3.6. Allele-specific binding of E47 contributes to transcriptional repression of EXO1

To shed more light on the functional mechanisms underlying the allele-dependent promoter activity of EXO1, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with oligonucleotides representing the genomic region surrounding rs1776180 and a panel of nuclear extracts derived from different human cell lines. With all extracts tested, we detected a dramatic reduction in specific bandshifts using the C allele of rs1776180 compared to the G allele (Fig. 3A, left panel). Specificity of protein binding was demonstrated by omitting nuclear extract in the binding reaction and by competition experiments (Fig. 3A, right panel). Using the JASPAR binding site prediction tool we found that the region directly surrounding rs1776180 contains a potential binding site for the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) E-Box-binding transcription factor E47 that is depleted by presence of the C allele of rs1776180. To demonstrate direct binding of E47 to the promoter region surrounding rs1776180, DNA-binding complexes were analyzed for the presence of E47 protein by EMSA and subsequent immunoblotting (‘Shift-Western’). As shown in Fig. 3B, E47 protein was detectable in two individual protein complexes that bound to the G allele of rs1776180 while no E47 was found binding to the C allele. E47, which is capable of forming homo- and heterodimers like other members of the E-Box protein subfamily, is encoded by

For all nuclear extracts analyzed, decreased protein binding is observed for the C allele (left panel). Detection of two specific bandshifts reflects the presence of more than one DNA-binding protein complex. Specificity of binding was shown for the G allele by omitting nuclear extracts in the binding reaction and by competition experiments, using unlabeled specific oligonucleotide or unspecific oligonucleotide at 100- or 200-fold molar excess (right panel).

4. Discussion

We have identified exonuclease 1 (EXO1) as a candidate for a novel susceptibility gene for prolonged life expectancy in humans. Among the associated SNPs the promoter variant rs1776180 was found to be functionally relevant by influencing EXO1 gene expression. The region surrounding rs1776180 contains a binding site for transcription factor E47, which is functional only when the G allele of the SNP is present. The C allele is enriched in female centenarians and leads to a loss of transcription factor binding to the E47 consensus site. Since E47 acts as a repressor of EXO1 transcription, the substitution of G by C at rs176180 should consequently result in a higher promoter activity. Supportive evidence was obtained from the ex vivo analysis of EXO1 mRNA levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines that revealed a statistically significant increase in gene expression in female individuals. Genetic replication of rs1776180 in a French sample confirmed the initial observation. In contrast to APOE, the effect of EXO1 on longevity is moderate [OR = 1.47 in Germans, OR = 1.39 in French; compare OR = 0.42 (corresponding to 1/OR = 2.4) and 0.29 (corresponding to 1/OR = 3.4) of APOE in Germans and French in the present study, respectively]. The effect size is about the same magnitude as for FOXO3A (OR   1.4; Flachsbart et al., 2009) and conforms to the hypothesis that genes with low to moderate effect

For further analysis of functional crosstalk between E47 and EXO1 regulation, we used RNAi-mediated gene knock-down of E47 and transient over-expression of an E47-EYFP fusion protein. Knock-down of endogenous E47 in HeLa cells by RNAi (Fig. 3C) resulted in a statistically significant increase in EXO1 promoter transactivation using reporter constructs carrying the G allele of rs1776180 (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, over-expression of E47 fusion protein decreased luciferase activity, thus arguing for a role of E47 as negative regulator of EXO1 promoter activity. Using the same experimental setting, a small, but significant increase in luciferase activity was also detectable using constructs with the C allele of rs1776180 (not shown). This observation may suggest a minor contribution from other potential E47 binding sites in the proximal promoter region, which are not affected by any genetic variation influencing life expectancy. However, absolute basal luciferase activity of the C allele constructs was up to 8-fold higher than those carrying the G allele (data not shown), which is consistent with our above- mentioned results (Fig. 2A).

Since this novel regulatory mechanism is only relevant in tissues and cell types expressing both EXO1 and E47/TCF3, we analyzed the tissue distribution pattern of both genes. EXO1 is strongly expressed in thymus, spleen and testis and showed a weaker, but yet detectable, expression in brain, liver and ovary (Fig. 3E). E47/TCF3 mRNA displayed a remarkably similar expres- sion pattern with strongest signals in spleen, thymus, liver, and testis and lower expression in heart, brain and ovary. Thus, concomitant expression of EXO1 and E47/TCF3 was most pro- nounced in lymphatic tissues and the reproductive organs.

EXO1 is a 50–30 exonuclease that participates in post-replication DNA mismatch repair and other DNA metabolic pathways affecting genomic stability, including homologous recombination and DNA damage repair (Liberti and Rasmussen, 2004; Mimitou and Symington, 2008; Qiu et al., 1999). In addition, EXO1 has recently been shown to contribute to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Bolderson et al., 2009; Klapacz et al., 2009). EXO1 physically interacts with the WRN protein that is encoded by the gene implicated in Werner Syndrome, one of the human progeria diseases (Sharma et al., 2003). WRN is crucial for the maintenance of overall genomic stability and, like EXO1, is also required for DNA repair and telomere metabolism (Lombard et al., 2005). The complexation of both proteins causes strong activation of EXO1 (Sharma et al., 2003). It has been suggested that WRN-induced stimulation of EXO1 activity may be important for the replication and stability of telomeres as well as the activation of DNA damage and signal checkpoint pathways in response to shortened telomeres (Sharma et al., 2003). An involvement of EXO1 in these pathways has been shown in both telomere-dysfunctional yeast and mouse models (Maringele and Lydall, 2002; Schaetzlein et al., 2007).

Taken together, our data indicate a major impact of variants of promoter SNP rs1776180 on EXO1 transcriptional regulation and suggest an important and hitherto undescribed role for E47 as a repressor of EXO1 expression.

3.7. EXO1-association replicated in female French centenarians

The functional results prompted us to focus the genetic replication of the association between EXO1 and longevity on the promoter SNP rs1776180. Since the effect of this functionally relevant polymorphism was apparent only in German women (Table 3 and Fig. 2B), we just considered females for validation. We analyzed rs1776180 in a collection of 455 French female centenarians and 109 younger individuals whose age range was comparable to that of the German controls. In this French sample, the APOE-adjusted analysis confirmed the association signal (P = 0.044) (Table 4). The French allele and genotype APOE frequencies were similar to the original findings in the Germans and an enrichment of the C allele in the centenarians compared to the controls was apparent in both populations. Therefore, the combined genetic and functional analyses point to a pivotal role of rs1776180 in the allele-specific regulation of EXO1, which in turn influences the ability to survive to exceptional old age.

An important role of EXO1 in controlling life expectancy has previously been reported in a murine model with a genetic ablation of the nuclease domain of the gene (Exo1(cid:3)/(cid:3)). The respective animals were viable, but their lifespan was significantly shortened (Schaetzlein et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2003). A first report of the Exo1(cid:3)/(cid:3) knock-out mouse model on a mixed genetic background suggested that the beneficial influence of an increased Exo1 activity on lifespan could lie in mutation avoidance and, therefore, in the prevention of tumorigenesis (Wei et al., 2003). However, a recent study has shown that congenized mice carrying the same Exo1 inactivation on a pure C57BL/6J background displayed a considerably shorter survival without a significant

rise in cancer formation, indicating that other factors contribute to the lifespan reduction in Exo1(cid:3)/(cid:3) mice (Schaetzlein et al., 2007). In view of the similarly uncertain role of EXO1 in human carcinogen- esis (reviewed by Liberti and Rasmussen, 2004), the possible links between EXO1 variation, cancer and life expectancy warrant further studies.

Our data implicate E47 as a repressor of EXO1 transcription. The E47protein(encodedbyTCF3/E2A)belongstotheE-Boxsubfamilyof basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors and is involved in the regulation of cell lineage commitment, growth and differentiation (Slattery et al., 2008). A recent study using a TCF3/ E2A-deficient murine lymphoma cell line and hierarchical cluster analysis of DNA microarray data identified E47-dependent gene expression as contributing to cell cycle progression, lipid metabo- lisms, stress response and cell survival (Schwartz et al., 2006). Interestingly, there are several lines of evidence linking E47 to aging processes.E47expressionlevel andactivityarediminishedinspleen and bone marrow of aged mice, compared to young animals (Frasca et al., 2003). In addition, impaired E47 activity has been shown to correlatewithareducedimmunoglobulinclassswitchinsenescingB cells (Frasca et al., 2004). The contribution of E47 to cellular aging is further emphasized by the finding that gene silencing of E47 delays the onset of cellular senescence in human fibroblasts (Zheng et al., 2004). The regulatory crosstalk of E47 and EXO1 observed in this study implies that the concomitant expression of both genes is required for the C allele of rs1776180tobe advantageous. Strikingly, our data reveal an overlap of their expression profiles in a number of tissues,includingliver,thymus, spleen,testesandovary.SinceE-Box proteins(e.g.E47,E12,HEN)arewellknowntoformhomo-aswellas heterodimeric complexes and to interact with other bHLH tran- scriptionfactors(e.g.TAL1,MyoD)(Hsuetal.,1994;Lluisetal.,2005), the complex role of E-Box proteins and interaction partners with regulatory function for human aging awaits further investigation. The pivotal future challenge, however, will be to clarify how increased tissue-specific EXO1 expression contributes to prolonged survival.

References

Our study demonstrates a female-specific association of an EXO1 promoter SNP with longevity. Such sex-specificity is not surprising since gender is a major determinant of longevity, favouring women. It also accounts for important differences in the frequency of various age-related diseases. There is a distinct prevalence of women among long-lived individuals, reaching up to 85% in some populations of centenarians and super-centenarians (Perls and Terry, 2003). It has been suggested that the mortality rates in men and women follow different trajectories during aging and that a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors is likely to affect the gender-specific probability of reaching old age (Candore et al., 2006; Franceschi et al., 2000).

Our results highlight the general importance of centenarians for genetic longevity research (Tan et al., 2008). Since the genetic contribution to life expectancy is strongest at very advanced ages (Hjelmborg et al., 2006), centenarians may be particularly enriched for beneficial variants in longevity-enabling genes (Flachsbart et al., 2009; Perls et al., 2002). This hypothesis is strengthened by our findings that variation in EXO1 leads to higher gene expression and confers a survival advantage at very old age. Hence, EXO1 could be considered a candidate for a novel longevity-enabling gene.
