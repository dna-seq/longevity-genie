pair was included in the study, resulting in a total of 1320 participants. The study was conducted to investigate genetic and environmental factors influencing age-related diseases and traits in middle-aged Danes. The participants were followed up in 2002 and 2007, and the vital status was obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System. 

3. Results

In this study, we examined the association between human longevity and common genetic variations in three major pathways: GH/IGF-1/insulin signaling, DNA damage signaling and repair, and pro/antioxidant pathways. We analyzed 1273 tagging SNPs in 148 genes belonging to these pathways. After correcting for multiple testing, we found rs9456497 (IGF2R) and 5 DNA repair SNPs (rs11571461 (RAD52), rs13251813 (WRN), rs1805329, rs2953983 (POLB), rs3211994 (NTLH1)) to be associated with longevity. 

In a longitudinal study with a follow-up of 11 years on survival in the oldest-old Danes, we found 2 pro/antioxidant SNPs (rs10047589 (TNXRD1), rs207444 (XDH)), 1 GH/IGF-1/INS SNP (rs26802 (GHRL)), and 3 DNA repair SNPs (rs13320360 (MLH1), rs2509049 (H2AFX), and rs705649 (XRCC5)) to be associated with mortality in late life. 

When examining the 11 SNPs from the case-control study in the longitudinal data, rs3842755 (INS), rs13251813 (WRN), and rs3211994 (NTHL1) showed the same directions of effect (p<0.05). Rs9456497 (IGF2R) and rs1157146 (RAD52) showed non-significant tendencies, indicative of effects also in late-life survival. In addition, rs207444 (XDH) presented the same direction of effect when inspecting the 6 SNPs from the longitudinal study. 

No formal replications were observed when investigating the 11 SNPs from the case-control study in 1613 oldest-old (age 95-110) and 1104 middle-aged Germans, although rs11571461 (RAD52) did show a supportive non-significant tendency (OR=1.162, 95% CI=0.927-1.457). The same was true for rs10047589 (TNXRD1) (HR=0.758,95%CI=0.543-1.058) when examining the 6 SNPs from the longitudinal study in a Dutch longitudinal cohort of oldest-old (age 85+, N=563). 

In conclusion, this candidate gene-based association study, the largest to date applying a pathway approach, not only points to potential new longevity loci but also underlines the difficulties of replicating association findings in independent study populations and thus the difficulties in identifying universal longevity polymorphisms. 

4. Introduction

Genetic factors contribute approximately 25% to variation in human lifespan (Herskind et al., 1996), with an effect thought to be minimal before age 60 years and most profound from age 85 years and onwards (Hjelmborg et al., 2006). Candidate longevity genes encode proteins involved in several biological processes, including lipid protein metabolism (APOE being by far the most validated longevity gene to date), GH/IGF-1/INS signaling, DNA damage signaling and repair, and pro/antioxidant pathways (Christensen et al., 2006). The genes composing these pathways encode proteins involved in processes such as energy metabolism, growth and differentiation, and the maintenance of genetic stability (including telomere stability), and protection against free radicals produced by the general metabolism. 

These are all processes believed to be of key importance for aging and longevity from nematodes to humans (reviewed in e.g. Burtner and Kennedy, 2010; Cluett and Melzer, 2009; Harman, 1973; Kenyon, 2010; Kuningas et al., 2008). Studies using various animal models have found that either depletion or over-expression of some of these candidate genes affect the lifespan of the organism (e.g. GH, GPX1, FOXO, KL, GHRHR, POLB, RAD52, INS and TP53 (Bartke, 2005; Cabelof et al., 2006; Flurkey et al., 2001; Giannakou et al., 2004; Holzenberger et al., 2003; Kawano et al., 2000; Kuro-o et al., 1997; Kurosites, SNPs located in regulatory regions such as promoters or enhancers). In addition, tagging SNPs were included to capture the genetic variation in the chromosomal regions of interest. Tagging SNPs were chosen using the Tagger algorithm implemented in Haploview version 4.2 (Barrett et al., 2005) with pairwise tagging, a minor allele frequency threshold of 5% and a r2 threshold of 0.8. In total, 1415 SNPs were selected for genotyping.

2.4. Genotyping and data cleaning
For genotyping, DNA was extracted from whole blood using standard procedures. The genotyping was performed using the Illumina GoldenGate platform (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and data cleaning was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the GenomeStudio software (http://www.illumina.com/software/genomestudio_software.ilmn). Primary exclusion criteria were a sample call rate of less than 90% and an SNP call frequency of less than 90%. Subsequently, SNPs clustering in certain categories were manually evaluated: call frequency between 90-95%, close SNP clusters (score less than 2.3), clusters with low intensity (score less than 0.2 or greater than 0.8), clusters having a heterozygote cluster shifting towards a homozygote cluster (score less than 0.13), SNPs with excess heterozygosity (score less than 0.3 or greater than 0.2) and SNPs located on the X chromosome (considering male hemizygosity). A total of 142 SNPs and 175 DNA samples were excluded leaving 1825 individuals, 148 candidate genes and 1273 SNPs for data analysis. Furthermore, 24 samples were included twice in order to investigate intra-plate reproducibility and 48 samples were included twice to test inter-plate reproducibility. Data showed an intra-plate reproducibility of 99.4% and an inter-plate reproducibility of 96.8%.

Overall, the study investigates the association of common genetic variation in 148 genes related to GH/IGF-1/INS signaling, DNA damage signaling and repair, and pro/antioxidant pathways with human longevity. The study uses both case-control and longitudinal designs to investigate these variations in key candidate genes of human longevity. Replication studies were conducted in German and Dutch populations to validate the findings from the Danish study. The genotyping was performed using the Illumina GoldenGate platform with data cleaning according to manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 1273 SNPs were successfully genotyped and included in data analysis after exclusion criteria were applied.and the GH/IGF-1/INS-SNP rs3842755 (INS) were found to be associated with increased survival in females (see Table 4B). These results suggest that the genetic factors influencing survival in the oldest-old Danes may differ between genders. However, further replication studies in independent cohorts are needed to confirm these findings.survival. Our study is unique in that we investigated a large number of candidate genes and SNPs using both casecontrol and longitudinal approaches. Our analysis revealed that variants in genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair, GH/IGF-1/INS signaling, and pro/antioxidant pathways are associated with human longevity. Specifically, the rare allele of variants in INS, IGF2R, POLB, RAD52, WRN and NTHL1 was advantageous for survival, while the rare allele of variants in KL, GHRHR, GHSR, GSR and RAD23B was disadvantageous. We also found sex-specific effects for some SNPs. However, our findings could not be formally confirmed in a German replication cohort of comparable size. Nonetheless, our study adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that genetic variations play a significant role in human longevity.Longevity. Moreover, a recent publication of gene-based case-control analysis of genes in the IGF-1/Insulin pathway reported gene-based association of INS with longevity (Deelen et al., 2011). Additionally, some of the 11 SNPs have been reported as associated with phenotypes of possible relevance to variation in lifespan; rs572169 (GHSR) with obesity (Gueorguiev et al., 2009), and rs2953983 (POLB), rs1805329 (RAD23), rs11571461 (RAD52) and rs13251813 (WRN) with different types of cancers (Pan et al., 2009; Schildkraut et al., 2010; Van Ness et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009).

Finally, to explore whether the 6 SNPs identified in the longitudinal study of oldest-old Danes presented a similar direction of effects on survival from middle age to old age, we investigated the 6 SNPs in the Danish case-control data. Only rs207444 (XDH) displayed a nominally significant effect in the same direction as found in the oldest old (p=0.005). The data are summarized in Table 6B.

4. Discussion

The vast majority of the candidate genetic association studies on longevity published so far has explored only a small number of SNPs. An interesting question was whether the genetic variants with a proposed effect on survival from middle age to old age would also demonstrate an effect for survival during old age. We tested the 11 SNPs for association with survival in the Danish 1905 cohort using the longitudinal design and found 3 SNPs to display the same nominal significant (p<0.05) direction of effect in the longitudinal data, while 2 SNPs showed similar tendencies (0.05<p<0.10). Interestingly, all 5 SNPs were apparent longevity SNPs, i.e. SNPs with a positive effect on survival. This is in line with a recent study suggesting that long life is not due to a decreased burden of negatively affecting disease variants but rather due to positively influencing longevity variants (Beekman et al., 2010).

A lack of similar effects in the longitudinal data for the remaining SNPs could indicate that these SNPs may be relevant at different ages, i.e. the influence of genes and gene variants may be of consequence for survival in young elderly but lose this importance at the highest ages.

When investigating the association of the 1273 SNPs with survival at advanced age using a longitudinal study approach, we identified 6 novel SNPs in 6 genes associated with longevity. The rare allele of a variant in H2AFX appeared disadvantageous, while the rare variants in GHRL, MLH1, TXNRD1, XDH and XRCC5 were advantageous for longevity. In line with these results, an MLH1 haplotype was previously reported to be associated with longevity in a case-control study (Kim et al., 2006), whereas genetic variants in GHRL have been described as associated with phenotypes of possible relevance to variation in lifespan; high HDL-cholesterol levels (Hubacek et al., 2007) and hypertension (Berthold et al., 2010). Finally, the activity of the XRCC5 protein product Ku80 has been reported to decrease from young to old age in humans (Scarpaci et al., 2003), indicating a biological change with age.

The Danish case-control study supported an advantageous effect of rs207444 (XDH) also on survival from middle age to old age, and additionally some support was observed for rs10047589 (TNXRD1) in the Dutch replication cohort, indicating a recessive mode of effect for this variant.

Interestingly, the longitudinal study revealed more longevity-associated SNPs in the sex-stratified analysis (4 of 6 SNPs) than the Danish case-control study (1 of 11 SNPs). This observation could indicate that the impact of genetic effect becomes more gender-specific during advanced age than at younger ages, and that the genetic effect in old age might be most pronounced for males. Such a difference between genders was recently suggested by Montesanto et al. (2011) for Italians.

From a pathway perspective, a few comments can be made on the genes holding the SNPs suggested here. For the GH/IGF-1/INS pathway, the present data suggest that variations in genes whose products take part in growth hormone synthesis and secretion (GHRHR, GHRL and GHSR) or in signaling to and affecting target organs/cells (INS, KL, IGF2R) might pose effects on longevity. With respect to DNA repair, the gene products of the genes holding the significant SNPs take part in different DNA repair activities, though the majority take part in baseAlternatively, the associated SNPs might simply be proxies for other truly causative variants. A number of reasons can be given for the lack of true replication. It could be a matter of underpowered replication populations. However, the number of German samples is larger than the Danish discovery cohorts, thus arguing against this explanation. Alternatively, it might be due to heterogeneity between samples, for instance differences in enrollment of the participants. As seen in Table 1, the German cases are older than the Danish oldest-old, whereas the members of the Dutch 85+ cohort are somewhat younger at intake than the Danish 1905 cohort members. Hence, if the effects of the variants are not constant throughout old age, they may not replicate well in these study samples. Changes in association effects with age have been reported previously (Jacobsen et al., 2010). Finally, it might simply be that the associations are population-specific, perhaps mediated through population-specific characteristics in the environment. Such population-specific effects have previously been suggested (Di Bona et al., 2009). How such suggested functional effects might impact aging and/or longevity is an extremely difficult question, especially considering that the role of the three pathways in aging and/or longevity appears very complex. In any case, functional studies of the molecular effects of the associated variants are needed. In our study, we only performed correction for multiple testing within each pathway since the selection of genes and SNPs was based on a sound a priori hypothesis. Moreover, due to the design of the statistical software, we corrected for multiple testing within each type of test. Hence, we did not correct for performing sex-stratified analysis as well as a test for both genders combined and with respect to the longitudinal study for investigating the two survival variables. Such corrections should, in principle, be included to avoid false positive findings.

If correcting the p-values from each pathway using the overly conservative Bonferroni approach, 8 of the 11 SNPs from the case-control study remained significant, while 1 of the 6 SNPs identified in the longitudinal study remained significant. By contrast, correction by the less conservative Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) method left more associations significant (10 SNPs from the case-control study and 1 SNP from the longitudinal study), thus underscoring the difference in conclusions based on the choice of method of correction. In any case, both of these correction methods assume independence between the tests, which is clearly not the case in our study.

Due to the emergence of high throughput techniques facilitating studies of sizable numbers of variations, the replication of initial findings has become a major issue in genetic epidemiology. In this study, we tested our findings from the case-control and longitudinal studies using German samples of 1613 long-lived individuals (95+) and 1104 middle-aged controls and a cohort of 85+ Dutch elderly, respectively. No formal replication was observed in either case, although a few supportive observations were found (see above).

In conclusion, we present new candidate variations for human longevity located in the DNA damage signaling and DNA repair pathways and the GH/IGF-1/INS signaling and pro/antioxidant pathways. We found that four of the 17 identified SNP associations showed significant and similar direction of effect when using the two different study approaches applied to the Danish discovery cohorts, while two SNP associations showed similar tendencies. However, none of the 17 SNP associations displayed replication in the independent samples from Germany and the Netherlands, although for two SNP associations some support was noticed.
