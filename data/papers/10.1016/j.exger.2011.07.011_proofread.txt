Italy. The UCP1 gene is involved in thermogenesis, a process that dissipates energy as heat in response to cold stress and excess caloric intake. This process has potential for controlling body mass and cellular fat metabolism. The study aimed to investigate the impact of UCP1 variability on survival since regulation of metabolism is one of the key pathways in lifespan extension. The results showed that two polymorphisms (A-3826G and C-3740A) located in the upstream promoter region of UCP1 affected gene expression and were correlated with human longevity. The A-C haplotype favored survival in the elderly, and transfection experiments showed that it had higher luciferase activity than the G-A haplotype. Interestingly, the different UCP1 haplotypes responded differently to hormonal stimuli. The study suggests a correlation between UCP1 activity and human survival, indicating the intricacy of mechanisms involved in energy production, storage, and consumption as key factors for understanding human aging and longevity.Italy. The functional relevance of the two polymorphisms in the context of haplotypes was also explored.

2.2. Genetic and statistical analyses

The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested using an approach based on 10,000 random allele permutations for each sample (Weir, 1996). An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented in the Arlequin software package (Excoffier et al., 2005), was used to obtain maximum likelihood estimation of multilocus haplotype frequencies for UCP1 genotypes. Standard deviations of the haplotype frequencies were estimated by a parametric bootstrap procedure (1000 replications). The D linkage disequilibrium coefficient was assessed using the Arlequin software package (Excoffier et al., 2005). Diplotypes were constructed based on the population genotypes in the UCP1 gene using a pseudo-Bayesian approach (ELB algorithm) implemented in the Arlequin software package (Excoffier et al., 2005).

In order to model haplotype/diplotype frequency as a function of age, we carried out a binomial logistic regression analysis, as previously reported by Tan and co-workers (Tan et al., 2001). For this purpose, the following model was used:

2. Materials and methods

In Eq. (1), g[(x)] represents a logit transformation of the ith frequency of carriers of haplotype h at age x, (x). Thus, the effect of haplotype h on survival is represented by the slope parameter i: if it is significantly different from 0, the frequency of carrier i1 of haplotype h goes up if N0 or down if b0.

2.1. Subjects and genotyping

A total of 910 unrelated individuals (age range: 40-109 years), consisting of 475 women and 435 men, participated in the study. The subjects were born and currently living in Calabria (southern Italy), and their parents and grandparents were native to the same area. They were collected during several recruitment campaigns (De Rango et al., 2010). All the subjects gave their informed consent to use their anonymous genetic and phenotypic data for genetic studies on aging and longevity.

For the diplotype frequencies, the previous model can be reformulated as:

The UCP1 A-3826G polymorphism was genotyped by genomic PCR and BclI-RFLP analysis as previously described (Oppert et al., 1994). To genotype the UCP1 C-3737A polymorphism, 35 μl of the amplified DNA as above was digested by the restriction enzyme DdeI (3 U) for 3 h at 37°C as recommended by the manufacturer. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.

Where the effect of diplotype h/h on survival is represented by the slope parameter i: if it is significantly different from 0, the frequency ij1 of carriers of diplotype h/h goes up if N0 or down if b0.

The binomial logistic regression model has been applied to estimate the effect of each of the three reconstructed haplotypes (A-C, G-A, and G-C) and relevant diplotypes on survival.

Each transfection experiment was carried out three times in duplicate.
Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software for Windows (www.cran.com).
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test with a significance level of 0.05 were adopted to check the significance of the difference between the fold induction values of the constructs containing the different haplotypes at basal conditions and after hormone stimulation.

harmful haplotype.
The slope parameters for both A-C and G-C haplotypes were not statistically different from 0, suggesting that their frequencies were independent of age.
Fig. 1 shows the frequency patterns for the G-A haplotype carriers.
As expected, both the observed and fitted frequencies indicated that there was a constant decline of this haplotype with increasing age.
In order to check if the detrimental effect of the G-A haplotype observed in both sexes involved a particular diplotype, we used the same model to analyze the frequency of the carriers of each of the six reconstructed diplotypes as a function of age.
Table 4 reports the parameter estimates for all the reconstructed diplotypes.
Diplotype A-C/A-C showed a significant positive slope parameter (=0.009; p=0.032), indicating that the frequency of subjects with this diplotype increases with age.
The diplotype A-C/G-A also showed a significant negative slope parameter (=0.014; p=0.014), which indicates that the frequency of subjects with this diplotype decreases with age (Fig. 2).
As for the haplotypes, if one considers an age interval of 15 years, the corresponding ORs from the relevant fitted models were 1.144 and 0.811 for diplotype A-C/A-C and A-C/G-A, respectively.
The diplotype A-C/G-C did not show any significant variation with age.
The other diplotypes failed to reach the level of significance probably due to their low frequencies.
On the whole, these results indicate that the A-C haplotype has a recessive and beneficial effect, while the G-A haplotype has a dominant and deleterious effect on human aging and longevity.

3. Results

3.1. Haplotype/diplotype analyses

On a sample of 910 subjects categorized by age and sex as reported in Passarino et al. (2006).
In each group, there was no evidence of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05).
The two SNPs, which are very close to each other, resulted in linkage disequilibrium (D=0.99, r2=0.58).
Frequency distributions of two-marker haplotypes and diplotypes are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
We modeled the frequency of the carriers of each of the reconstructed haplotype/diplotype as a function of age by using the binary logistic regression model.

The A-C and G-A haplotypes have a positive effect on UCP1 transcriptional activity compared to the GC haplotype. However, they have opposite effects on longevity, which may be explained by considering the haplotype-specific effect after hormonal stimuli. Progesterone up-regulates while estradiol down-regulates the transcriptional activity of the AC haplotype, while neither changes the transcriptional activity of GA. Therefore, it is likely that the real in vivo effect of these haplotypes on complex phenotypes such as aging and longevity is mediated by the intricacy of different cellular and physiological stimuli. Similarly, this may explain why the G-C haplotype, lacking any transcriptional activity, did not show significant changes in its frequency during aging. This observation calls for a better understanding of the different stimuli affecting UCP1 transcription.

Human aging is accompanied by changes in energy balance and body composition which are consequent to hormonal changes (Hughes et al., 2004). In this context, the role of BAT is particularly important since it regulates energy expenditure in the elderly. Although the amount of BAT in human adults is low, it is responsible for 12% of energy expenditure, which is enough to prevent weight gain of about 2 kg per year (Lean, 1989). Consistently, an inverse relation between BAT and BMI, body fat, and visceral fat is observed in aging (Mattson, 2010; Vijgen et al., 2011). UCP1, which is expressed in BAT, has been observed to influence metabolism and fat presence of consensus sex steroid responsive elements within the UCP1 sequence is very intriguing. Indeed, there are several reports considering sex steroid hormones as modulators of the thermogenic capacity and activity of BAT (Monjo et al., 2003; Valle et al., 2008). The different effects of the UCP1 haplotypes could be explained by considering changes in the regulation of metabolism with aging, possibly mediated by age-related variations in hormonal status. Moreover, as suggested by Fessele et al. (2002), the importance of the sequence context in determining the functionality of a regulatory region clearly emerges. In fact, although the two polymorphisms did not alter either the binding site for progesterone or estradiol, a clear haplotype-specific effect on transcriptional activity was observed following hormonal stimulation.

Carriers of the G allele have a diminished resting energy expenditure, while carriers of the G/G genotype have reduced thermoregulatory sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. This finding suggests that the attenuation of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis may have a negative effect on energy balance regulation. The survival advantage exerted by the A-C haplotype could then be a consequence of protection towards age-related decline of energy expenditure. These results seem to be in line with those reported by Rizzo et al. (2005) showing that very old individuals have a higher metabolic rate than older individuals. Human cohort studies also support a relationship between advanced age and body temperature (Waalen and Buxbaum, 2011), suggesting that the individual's ability to maintain a lower steady-state body temperature may affect longevity. Although skeletal muscles may play a role in non-shivering thermogenesis (Wijers et al., 2008), the age-related diminished thermogenic activity of BAT might be the primary cause for the loss of thermoregulation (Son'Kin et al., 2010). An analysis of BMI would be crucial to better understand how UCP1 activity affects longevity. Unfortunately, information on BMI was available only for a subgroup of our sample. Therefore, we cannot fully address whether or not UCP1 affects longevity through BMI. Further studies are needed to clarify this point.

Since the preservation of mitochondrial function from oxidative stress represents one of the most important factors for achieving survival for the very old, the specific involvement of UCP1 in reducing ROS production (Oelkrug et al., 2010; Dlaskov et al., 2010) may represent a further mechanism through which mitochondrial uncoupling in BAT can contribute to slowing down aging. The hypothesis that UCP1 haplotypes affect ROS production is currently under investigation.

The present study shows that haplotypic variants in the 5-enhancer region of the UCP1 gene modulate survival, probably by affecting protein levels. This is the first study reporting a significant association between UCP1 genetic variants and human survival; however, additional data are needed. The soundness of our preliminary findings is supported by the consistency between our association and in vitro studies and previous studies in model organisms.
