Abstract

Age is associated with an enhanced low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherosclerosis, thus, subjects over 80 years without cardiovascular disease provide a model to investigate the protective factors against atherosclerosis. Serum paraoxonase (PON1), an high density lipoprotein (HDL)-bound enzyme, prevents LDL oxidation.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of the PON1 promoter T(-107)C and coding region Gln192Arg (Q192R) and Leu55Met (L55M) polymorphisms to the resistance to develop cardiovascular events in Sicilian healthy octogenarians. Distribution of PON1 genotypes and activity, and biochemical parameters, were compared between 100 octogenarians and 200 adults. Individuals in the elderly group displayed significant higher levels of HDL-C ðP , 0:001Þ and PON1 activity ðP , 0:001Þ: The analysis of PON1 genotypes distribution showed an higher percentage of (-107)CC among octogenarians compared with controls. A significant difference among T(-107)C genotypes respect to PON1 activity and HDL-C levels occurred in both groups. The CC genotype was associated with higher PON1 activity and HDL levels compared to the TT genotypes.

In conclusion, our results provide a strong evidence that in healthy Sicilians ageing may be characterized by a low frequency of PON1 (-107)T ‘risk’ allele and by an high frequency of favourable genotypes such as (-107)CC, influencing PON1 activity and HDL-C levels. q 2004 Elsevier Inc.

in frequency with ageing (Hofman et al., 1991; Fried et al., 1998). Thus, the old subjects who achieve long life-spans in absence of severe atherosclerosis related disorders, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and peripheral artery disease, can provide a model to investigate the protective factors increasing their resistance to develop atherosclerotic disease (Rowe and Kahn, 1987).

The elderly persons have been suggested to have a greater risk for oxidative stress (Beckman and Ames, 1998) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation (Jira et al., 1996), which may contribute to the increased incidence of atherosclerotic disease in this population (Steinberg et al., 1989). A decline in protective mechanisms against oxidative stress has also been found during ageing (Azhar et al., 1995; Napoli et al., 1997; Lykkesfeldt et al., 1998). Moreover, conditions such as hypertension, smoking habit, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, which may enhance oxidative

Human serum paraoxonase (PON1), a high density lipoprotein (HDL) associated ester hydrolase enzyme has been shown to protect LDL from oxidation by the hydrolysis of biologically active lipoperoxides (Mackness et al., 1991). Animal models, including PON1-knockout mice, demon- strated that PON1 deficiency was related to an increased susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and atherosclerosis

development (Shih et al., 1996). In human, it has been suggested that PON1 is significantly associated with CAD risk (Mackness et al., 1991; Ayub et al., 1999) and that its activity is under genetic regulation an vary widely among individuals and populations (Sanghera et al., 1998). PON1 activity variation has been related mainly to the expression of two polymorphisms located in the coding region of PON1 gene, Glutamine 192 Arginine (Q192R) and Leucine 55 Metionine (L55M; Ruitz et al., 1995; Garin et al., 1997). While the L55M polymorphism affects serum PON1 levels (Garin et al., 1997), 192 Q and R isoforms show low and high activity, respectively, towards synthetic substrate paraoxon (Ruitz et al., 1995). The role of these polymorph- isms in predicting atherosclerosis remains controversial, actually several studies revealed a significant association between PON1 coding region polymorphisms and CAD risk (Sanghera et al., 1997,1998; Ruitz et al., 1995; Garin et al., 1997; Serrato and Marian, 1995; Salonen et al., 1999) while others reported a lack of association (Herrmann et al., 1996; Ombres et al., 1998; Gardemann et al., 2000; Arca et al., 2002).

Inclusion criteria for study population were normal ECG pattern and no history or clinical signs of arterial disease including CAD, stroke or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Subjects with cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination) and functional (Barthel Index and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) impairment, thyroid, hepatic or kidney disease, infectious or autoimmune disease were excluded from the study.

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population. In all the subjects blood pressure, height, and weight were measured by routine methods and venous blood for clinical chemistry and DNA analysis was collected after overnight fasting.

Hypertension was defined as BP ^ 140/90 or current use of anti hypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was defined according to the American Diabetes Association (Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 1997) or participant was taking insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Hypercholes- terolemia was defined on the basis of total cholesterol levels ^ 6 mmol/l.

mutations in the promoter region of PON1 gene (Leviev and James, 2000). In particular, the T(-107)C promoter poly- morphism has been shown to have a dominant effect on PON1 gene expression and enzymatic activity (Leviev and James, 2000), thereby it has been investigated as an independent predictor of atherosclerotic disease (James et al., 2000, 2001). The (-107)TT genotype, has been found to associate with low PON1 activity and has been found to be a risk factor for CAD (James et al., 2000, 2001). The aim of the present study was to find out whether PON1 gene promoter region T(-107)C, and coding region Q192R and L55M polymorphisms may influence the resistance to develop cardiovascular events in Sicilian healthy octogenarians.

Plasma lipids and blood glucose levels were measured by routine enzymatic methods. HDL-cholesterol was deter- mined after precipitation of the Apo B-containing lipopro- teins with magnesium phosphotungstate. LDL-cholesterol was calculated by the Friedewald formula.

Paraoxonase activity was determined with spectrophoto- metric assay with paraoxon (O,O-diethil-O-p-nitrophenyl- phosphate) as substrate. Serum was added to Tris–HCl buffer (100 mmol/l at pH 8) containing 2 mmol/l CaCl and 2 5 mmol/l paraoxon or 1 mmol phenyl acetate (Sigma

2. Methods

2.1. Subjects and methods

The study population was composed by 100 healthy octogenarians (49 men and 51 women, mean age ^ 84.18 3.6 years) recruited from all the surroundings of Messina with the help of the local general practitioners and 200 healthy controls (96 men and 104 women, mean ^ age 51.34 12.6 years) recruited from the Hospital staff (doctors, nurses and medical orderly). All of them were unrelated and of Sicilian origin. The baseline examination consisted of a home interview and a clinic examination. Specific details of medical history were confirmed by contacting the participant’s physician. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the study was approved by Ethic Committee of the University of Messina.

Chemical Co). The hydrolysis of paraoxon was continuously monitored at 412 nm, 25 8C (molar extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol at 412 nm: 16.900 mol/l21· cm21). Non-enzy- matic hydrolysis of paraoxon was subtracted from the total rate of hydrolysis. PON1 activity was expressed in U/l; 1 unit is equivalent to 1 mmol/min of p-nitrophenol.

calculated by the gene counting method Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Assumption of normal distribution for con- tinuous variables was tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of goodness of fit. Non-normally distributed variables were compared by Kruskal–Wallis, non-parametric combination test and with multiple comparisons.

Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the contribution of age in the study. P-values lesser than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance and P-values were based on two-sided test.

2.2. Genotype determination

The DNA was extracted from the whole blood according to standard procedures. PON1 genotypes were determined by PCR amplification and restriction analysis. PCRs reaction (total volume 25 ml) contained 150 ng DNA template, 200 mM dNTPs, 400 nM of each primer, 1.5 mM MgCl and 0.6 of Taq polymerase (Perkin–Elmer 2 cetus, USA) 35 cycles of amplification (3 min at 94 8C followed by 30 s at 95 8C, 20 s at specific primers annealing temperature and 50 s at 72 8C) with a final extension of 10 min at 72 8C were performed. PCR amplification of PON1 L55M polymorphism was performed using the 0 following primers: sense 5 CCTGCAATAATATGAAAC- AACCTG30 and reverse 50 TGAAAGACTTAAACTGCC- AGTC30 (annealing temperature: 63 8C).

between controls and octogenarians. The old people group displayed significant higher levels of total cholesterol ðP , 0: 05Þ; HDL-C ðP , 0: 001Þ and PON1 activity ðP , 0: 001Þ: No significant differences in mean BMI, blood pressure, LDL-C, triglyceride and glucose levels were found between the two groups. The number of smokers, diabetic, hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients was com- parable between the two groups. All variables were similar between male and female subjects, except for PON1 activity ^ levels, higher in males than females (241.23 123.74 vs ^ 197.46 109.78 U/ml).

PCR products were digested with Nla III (New England Bio Labs, Cambridge, UK) and the digestion resulted in 66- and 106-bp fragments for the 55M allele and in a no- digested 172-bp fragment for the 55L allele.

PON1 Q192R polymorphism was detected using the following primers: sense 50 TATTGTTGCTGTGGGA- CCTGAG30 and reverse 50 CCTGAGAATCTGAGTAAA- TCCACT30 , (annealing temperature: 60 8C).

PON1 genotypes and alleles distribution are reported in Table 2. The frequencies of PON1 genotypes were comparable to those previously reported in Caucasian populations (Garin et al., 1997) and were in Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium in both groups.

PCR products were digested with Alw I (New England Bio Labs, Cambridge, UK) and resulted in 66- and 172-bp fragments for the 192R allele and in a no-digested 238-bp fragment for the 192Q allele.

The analysis of PON1 promoter T(-107)C genotype frequencies showed a greater percentage of subjects with the (-107)CC genotype (27%) among octogenarians compared with the (-107)CC genotype found in the controls (14%).

PCR amplification of the PON1 T(-107)C polymorphism 0 was performed with the following primers: sense 5 AGCTAG- 0 0 CTGCGGACCCGGCGGGGAGGaG3 and reverse 5 GGC- TGCAGCCCTCACCACAACCC30 , (annealing temperature: 67 8C). The lower case base in PON1 (-107) upstream primer indicates a mismatch, introducing a restriction site for BseBI enzyme (New England Bio Labs, Cambridge, UK), because there is no specific restriction site cutting the DNA original sequence. After digestion, the (-107)C allele was identified by 28and212-bpfragments,whereasthe(-107)Talleleresultedin a no-digested 240-bp fragment.

4. Discussion

No difference in the L55M and Q192R genotypes distribution was found in both groups.

For the first time, our results show that the PON1 gene promoter T(-107)C polymorphism could significantly affect the resistance to develop cardiovascular disorders in old subjects. A significant higher percentage of subjects with the (-107)CC genotype was found among the octogenarians compared with controls; the (-107)CC genotype was associated with higher PON1 activity and plasma HDL levels than (-107)TT genotype.

Linkage disequilibrium was observed between the PON1 promoter T(-107)C and L55M coding region (X2 ¼ 33: 34; : P , 0 001) polymorphisms and between L55M and Q192R coding region polymorphisms (X2 ¼ 14: 65; P , 0: 005).

No significant differences were detected among PON1 polymorphisms genotypes with respect to age, sex, BMI, smoking habit, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, lipid and glucose levels in both groups of subjects. There were significant differences among T(-107)C genotypes with respect to PON1 activity and HDL-C levels in both groups. The (-107)TT genotype showed the lowest values of PON1 activity, the (-107)CC genotype showed the highest ones and heterozygous genotypes had intermediate values (Table 3). Similarly, the (-107)CC genotype showed the highest levels : of HDL-C than (-107)TT genotype (P , 0 001; Table 4).

Until now, no investigation on the association between PON1 promoter T(-107)C polymorphism and atherosclero- tic disease has been performed in subjects aged 80 years and over. Indeed, the T(-107)C polymorphism has been found to be associated with CAD in younger but not in elder subjects (James et al., 2000, 2001). In this context, the PON1 function is particularly relevant as PON1 is sensitive to oxidative stress (Hayek et al., 1997) and could loose its activity with ageing (Beckman and Ames, 1998), thus, compromising the PON1 protective role on atherosclerosis and masking the impact of PON1 promoter polymorphism

A significant relationship between PON1 promoter polymorphism and no clinical CAD signs with ageing was found in our sample, indeed justifying our data, we enrolled healthy octogenarians, who showed no reduction in PON1 activity. The mayor implication of these findings is that the (-107)CC genotype, beside to be a predictor of decreased CAD risk in younger subjects (James et al., 2000, 2001) can significantly affect the healthy ageing, delaying the progression of cardiovascular events.

Analyzing Q192R and L55M genotypes, we did not find any different distribution in both groups of subjects or any significant association between these genotypes and PON1 activity. A significant relationship between Q192R polymorphism and age-related myocardial infarction risk

(Sent`ı et al., 2001) has been recently reported, by contrast no relation between Q192R and L55M polymorphisms, CAD and cardiovascular mortality in elderly persons has been also observed (Heijmans et al., 2000). The lack of association found between Q192R and L55M polymorph- isms and PON1 activity could be partially attributed to the fact that these mutations are not causally related to atherosclerosis but are rather influenced by other functional PON1 gene polymorphisms (Leviev and James, 2000), such as T(-107)C, implicating that the promoter mutation could affect the association between PON1 192 and 55 poly- morphisms and CAD risk (James et al., 2000, 2001).

diet may provide an higher level of protection against oxidative stress (Bonanome et al., 1992; Visioli and Galli, 2001). In this case, the relative contribution of PON1 promoter polymorphism and activity to resistance to develop cardiovascular disorders might be overestimated.

In conclusion, our data provide evidence of a significant prevalence of PON1 promoter (-107)CC genotype in Sicilian octogenarians whit no clinical CAD signs. Further- more, they underline the protective role of PON1 activity and HDL-C increased values in healthy ageing and otherwise do not exclude the antioxidant protective effect of the Mediterranean diet in Sicilian population on development of atherosclerosis.

Ageing has been shown to result in a decrease of plasma HDL-C levels, however, HDL-C levels have been reported to increase in healthy elderly subjects (Nikkila and Keikkinen, 1990): this candidate HDL as a selective feature for longevity (Burke et al., 2001). HDL-C levels were higher in octogenarians than in controls, furthermore there was a significant association between HDL levels and T(-107)C genotypes in both groups, being the CC genotypes associated with the highest HDL concentration. Similarly, a significant relationship between PON1 activity and HDL-C levels occurred when these parameters were analysed in both groups (octogenarians and younger subjects) separately. PON1 activity and localization are intimately linked with HDL, nevertheless, it would be hypothesized that PON1 gene may have a role in affecting lipid metabolism and levels. Actually, several studies lack to find an association between PON1 genotype and lipid profile (Nevin et al., 1996; Xia et al., 2003), however, genetic variations in PON1 have been found to associate with variation in plasma lipoprotein traits (Saha et al., 1991; Hegele et al., 1995). Although the function of paraoxonase in lipoprotein metabolism remains an unanswered question our data could support the suggestion that PON1 gene may be a determinant of plasma lipoproteins. Further investi- gations are needed to clarify this assumption. Conversely, beneficial factors affecting HDL, such as diet, gender and life style, would be expected to influence HDL composition

PON1 genotype frequencies were comparable to those previously reported in other Caucasian populations, indicating no segregation of PON1 gene variants in our sample. Adults younger than 65 years matched for risk factors and with no signs for CAD were selected as control subjects. Additionally, the number of elder subjects enrolled could be one potential limitation of the present study, however, it should be noted that the sample was clinically well defined.
