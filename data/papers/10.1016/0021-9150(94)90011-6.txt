Abstract

To test if the prevalence of genetic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) is low in individuals who have reached an extremely old age, the allele frequencies of apolipoprotein E (apo E) and B (apo B) polymorphisms and plasma lipoprotein(a) levels were investigated in nonagenarians and in younger control groups. The frequency of the ~4 allele of apo E was significantly lower in the nonagenarians than in the middle-aged and young adults (P < 0.05). Also, the frequency of EcoRI allele R- of apo B was low in the nonagenarians, whereas the allele frequency for the J&I polymorphism of apo B and plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations did not differ between the nonagenarians and the younger groups. These findings strongly suggest that the presence of these potential genetic risk factors for CHD, namely the ~4 allele of apo E and the R- allele of apo B, decreases the probability of an individual reaching an extreme-

1, Introduction

tors are involved in determining an individual’s susceptibility to CHD [3]. In a population with a high incidence of CHD, a low frequency of genetic risk factors for CHD could contribute to longevity so that possible protective genotypes would be enriched in extremely old cohorts.

Apo E is one of the major protein constituents in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism [4,5]. Apo E has three common isoforms, namely E2, E3 and E4, which are coded by the alleles ~2, ~3 and

~4 respectively at a single locus on chromosome 19. These alleles define six apo E phenotypes: E2/2, E2/3 and E2/4 (referred to as E2 category), E3/3 (E3 category), E4/3 and E4/4 (E4 category). The E4 category is associated with high serum total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in many populations [4-61. In Finland, the prevalence of e4 allele is higher than in most other countries [6].

The control group (n = 260) consisted of healthy volunteers who worked in the Oulu University Hospital (n = 200, age 21-62 years) [14], and of healthy employees of a telecommunications com- pany (n = 60, age 35-64 years) [ 151. The control subjects were divided into two age categories: 40 years or younger (n = 124) and over 40 years (n = 136). The groups are referred to as young adults and middle-aged adults respectively. One individual in the latter group was diabetic. None of the control subjects was on lipid lowering drug therapy.

Apo B is the sole protein constituent in LDL, the major cholesterol carrying lipoprotein. Re- striction fragment polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the apo B gene, detected with the enzymes X&I and EcoRI have been shown to be associated with the occurrence of CHD [7,8]. Several epidemiological studies have indicated that another apo B- containing lipoprotein, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is also atherogenic [9- 111. The genetically determin- ed polymorphism of apolipoprotein(a) (ape(a)) is related to plasma Lp(a) concentrations [12], so that ape(a) isoforms predict risk for CHD through their effects on Lp(a) concentrations in some populations [ 131.

2.2. Methods

A venous blood sample was obtained into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes after an overnight fast, and the plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1200 x g for 10 min (+4”(Z). LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were estimated from the fresh plasma as described in the Lipid Research Clinics Manual of Laboratory Operations [ 161.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether polymorphisms at the apo E and apo B gene loci and plasma Lp(a) levels are associated with longevity in a population with a high risk for CHD. Specifically, the following questions were addressed: (i) is the prevalence of various apo E phenotypes in nonagenarians different from that in younger age groups? (ii) are the allele frequen- cies for the EcoRI and XbaI RFLP polymorphisms of the apo B gene in nonagenarians different from that in other age groups? and (iii) do the plasma Lp(a) levels change with increasing age?

Cholesterol and triglycerides (enzymatic colori- metric methods, kits of Boehringer Diagnostica, catalogue nos. 236691 and 701912 respectively, Boehringer Diagnostica, Mannheim GmbH, FRG) were analysed using a Gilford IMPACT 400E Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Gilford In- struments Laboratories Inc., Oberlin, OH).

The apo E phenotype was determined from the plasma with isoelectric focusing and immunoblot- ting techniques [6,17]. The first antibody was a rabbit antibody to human apo E. The second anti-

characteristics of the study groups

All the subjects of 90 years or older who lived in the town of Oulu (total population 100 000 inhabitants) were identified from community records. Eighty-seven women and 8 men (Table 1) (70% of the cohort, median age 93 years) gave an informed consent and volunteered for the study that had been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Oulu University. Of the study group, 30% lived at home, the rest being at institutions for the

was successful in 89 nonagenarians, 86 middle- aged adults and 102 young adults. The apo B gene probes were the genomic EcoRI fragment (pAB 3SC) used to detect the X&I RFLP [19] and the 2-kb Hind III fragment (pBH 2) to detect the EcoRI RFLP [7,20]. The allele resulting in the for- mation of an 8.5 kb X&I fragment is designated X- (absence of the cutting site) and that generating a 3.5 kb fragment X+ (presence of the cutting site). Probing EcoRI digests with pBH2 resulted in hybridizing fragments of IO.5 kb and

Plasma Lp(a) concentrations were determined by means of a two-site immununoradiometric assay (Pharmacia Diagnostica AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The coeflicient of variation within Lp(a) assays was 2.7% and 0.7% for samples with mean Lp(a) values of 3.7 and 43.3 mg/dI respectively. The coefficient of variation between assays was 7.9% and 5.5% for samples with mean Lp(a) values of 9.0 and 75.0 mgldl respectively.

homozygous and heterozygous apo E phenotypes were combined into E categories as follows: E2 = phenotypes E2/2, E2/3, E2/4; E3 = E3/3; E4 = E4/4, E4/3. Data were first tested by univariate procedure. The means of normally dis- tributed groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Groups of skewed, not nor- mally distributed data (such as Lp(a) concentra- tions) were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The gene-counting method was used for the esti- mation of gene frequencies. The x2 test was used to assess the distribution of allele frequencies between the groups.

The median concentration of plasma Lp(a) was similar in all age groups, being 8.4, 8.0 and 10.0 mg/dl in the young adults, middle-aged adults and nonagenarians respectively (Fig. 1). In the nona- genarians, plasma total and LDL-cholesterol levels tended to be lower in men (3.9 mM and 2.2 mM respectively) than in women (5.3 and 3.4 mM respectively), but the differences were not statistically significant.

3. Results

The frequency of the ~4 allele of apo E was significantly lower in the nonagenarians than in the middle-aged and young adults (x2 = 8.4 and x2 = 5.3 respectively, P < 0.05)(F ig. 2). When only females were included, the frequency of the ~4

allele was almost significantly lower in the nona- genarias (n = 87) than in the middle-aged (n = 51) and young adult groups (n = 53) (P < 0.06 for both comparisons). Also, the frequency of the ~4 allele was lower in the female nonagenarians than in the female subjects of both control groups (the middle-aged and young adult groups) (n = 104) (x2 = 5.0, P < 0.05).

the EcoRI genotype R-/R- (homozygosity for the absence of EcoRI cutting site) was somewhat lower in the nonagenarians (4.5%) than in the middle-aged and young adults (7.0% and 5.9% respectively) (P < 0.05). The frequency of the EcoRI allele R- was also lowest (14.6%) in the nonagenarians (Table 4). When women were anal- ysed separately, the frequency of R- allele was lower in the nonagenarians (n = 81) than in the middle-aged group (n = 30) (x2 = 6.6, P < 0.01) but not lower than in the young adult group (n = 48) (x2 = 1.5, NS). Also, the frequency for the R- allele was lower in the female nonagenarians than in the control group (n = 78) (x2 = 4.6, P < 0.05). The genotype distribution and the allele frequencies for the X&I polymor- phism did not differ between the nonagenarians and the control groups (Table 5).

The distribution of the apo E phenotype categories (Table 3) was different between the age groups (x2 = 10.4, P c 0.05), so that 33.1%, 37.5% and 19.0% of the young adults, middle-aged adults and nonagenarians, respectively, fell into the E4 category. In contrast, 8.9%, 5.9% and 11.6% of the young and middle-aged adults and nonagenarians, respectively, belonged to the E2 category, the E3 category consisting of 58.1%, 56.6% and 69.5% of the young, middle-aged and nonagenarian groups respectively. There were 6 individuals with the phenotype E 414 out of 124 young adults (4.9%) and also 6 with E 414 out of 136 middle-aged adults (4.4%), but only one E 4/4 out of 95 subjects (l.l”/,) in the nonagenarian group (Table 3). Of the 8 nonagenarian men, 2 had the phenotype E 213, 5 E 313, and one E 413. Again, when only females were included, the distribution of the apo E phenotype categories tended to be dif- ferent between the age groups (x2 = 7.3, NS) so that 34.0%, 37.2% and 19.5% of the female young adults, middle-aged adults and nonagenarians, respectively, fell into the E4 category.

4. Discussion

The major finding of this study was the low prevalence of the ~4 allele of apo E in the group of nonagenarians. This result supports the view that the presence of ~4 allele increases the susceptibility to CHD death and thus prevents the attainment of an extremely old age. This conclusion was also suggested by Davignon et al., who found a low frequency of the ~4 allele in Canadian octogenarias [21]. The present data show that the ~4 allele is a major risk factor for CHD also in a population in which the ~4 prevalence is exceptionally high [4,6]. Accordingly, the prevalence of ~4 allele is high in

lower and triglycerides were higher than in the younger age groups. This is in accordance with the study of Davignon et al. [21] in octogenarians. It is likely that low HDL cholesterol and high trigly- ceride values do not protect from atherosclerosis and thereby lead to longevity, but nutritional and metabolic changes associated with aging may rather result in low HDL and high triglyceride levels. This kind of lipid profile might be associ- ated with a high prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance frequently observed in aged individuals. The similarity in the Lp(a) levels among the

In- terestingly, a recent survey on the Helsinki Heart Study participants also failed to elucidate high Lp(a) levels as a predictor of CHD [25], but another previous investigation on the Finns reported a positive association between plasma Lp(a) and CHD [26].

No differences were observed in the XbaI polymorphism of apo B gene between the various age groups. This finding is in accordance with the results of Thieszen et al., who studied 41 nona- genarians in Nebraska [27]. In contrast, the R- allele of the EcoRI polymorphism of apo B gene was less prevalent in the nonagenarian group than in the younger age groups. A correlation between the rare allele R- and an increased risk for CHD has been found in many studies [8,28], although no such association was observed in a recent survey of young myocardial infarction survivors [29]. At the moment there is no direct evidence that this DNA mutation is causally related to the pathogenesis of CHD. It may be noteworthy, however, that the prevalence of R- allele in the control groups of our study is higher than in the healthy populations reported from other countries, and approximately at the same level as among CHD patients in other populations [8,28]. Overall, these findings suggest that the R- allele may be a risk factor for CHD. In conclusion, nonagenarians have a low preva-
