The ApoE gene is associated with the risk of Alzheimer or cardiovascular disease but its influence on exceptional longevity (EL) is uncertain. Our primary purpose was to determine, using a case–control design, if the ApoE gene is associated with EL. We compared ApoE allele/genotype frequencies among the following cohorts: cases (centenarians, most with 1+ major disease condition; n = 163, 100–111 years) and healthy controls (n = 1039,20–85 years) fromSpain;disease-freecases(centenarians; n= 79,100–104 years)and healthy controls (n = 597, age 27–81 years) from Italy; and cases (centenarians and semi-supercentenarians, most with 1+ major disease condition; n = 729, 100–116 years) and healthy controls (n = 498, 23–59 years) from Japan.Ourmainfindingsweretwofold.First,theε4-allelewasnegativelyassociatedwithELinthethreecohorts, with the following odds ratio (OR) values (adjusted by sex) having been found: 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33, 0.94), P = 0.030 (Spain); 0.41 (95%CI: 0.18, 0.99), P = 0.05 (Italy); and 0.35 (95%CI: 0.26, 0.57), P b 0.001 (Japan). Second, although no association was found in the Spanish cohort (OR = 1.42 (95%CI: 0.89, 2.26), P = 0.145), the ε2-allele was positively associated with EL in the Italian (OR = 2.14 (95%CI: 1.18, 3.45), P = 0.01) and Japanese subjects (OR = 1.81 (95%CI: 1.25, 2.63), P = 0.002).

genotypes (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε2/ε4, ε3/ε3, ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4). The ApoE is associated with the risk of having several age-related conditions, such ascardiovasculardisease(CVD,includingcoronaryheartdiseaseandce- rebrovascular disease) (Kumar et al., 2012) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Liu et al., 2013) including also late-onset AD (Sadigh-Eteghad et al., 2012), with the ε4-allele being the unfavorable allele. Thus, the latter variant increases mortality risk (Christensen et al., 2006). Recent data also support an association of ApoE and mortality in long-lived indi- viduals. A genome-wide linkage analysis with nonagenarians identified ApoE as a longevity gene (Beekman et al., 2013), which is in agreement with the results of a recent case–control genome-wide association study comparing long-lived individuals (mean age: 99.7 years) and

1. Introduction

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a major cholesterol carrier that supports lipid transport and injury repair in the brain. The ApoE gene is polymor- phic, and the vast majority of population studies have focused on the three most common alleles (ε2, ε3 and ε4) that result in six possible

younger controls from Germany (Nebel et al., 2011). However, whether ApoE influences exceptional longevity (EL), i.e., reaching 100+ years of age, is more controversial.

cohort of the Vallecas Project. The latter is a longitudinal study of older subjects with either no or mild cognitive impairment aimed at the early detection of AD. The history of past and current disease was collected by personal interview with the participants. Exclusion criteria were having stroke or traumatic brain injury with severe physical or cognitive impair- ment, clinically evident cancer, major psychiatric disorders or severe sys- temic diseases (e.g., chronic renal or liver failure). None of the subjects hadcriteriaofcognitiveimpairmentafterbeingsubmittedtoanextensive neuropsychological battery that included: Mini-mental-State Examina- tion (MMSE), Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), Verbal Fluency Task (P, M & R), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF), Drawing Clock Test, Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)-15 of Reisberg and Global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). All subjects with CDR N 0 were excluded from the present study.

The majority of reports indicate a lower frequency of the ApoE ε4-allele in centenarians compared with younger controls, i.e., in French (Blanche et al., 2001; Schachter et al., 1994), Finnish (Louhija et al., 1994), Southern Italian (Panza et al., 1999), or Chinese cohorts (Feng et al., 2011). However, others found no association of this variant with EL in Japanese (Asada et al., 1996), Finnish (Louhija et al., 2001) or Southern-Italian centenarians (Capurso et al., 2004). Concurrently, the ApoE ε2-allele has been reported to be more frequent in centenarians (Blanche et al., 2001; Louhija et al., 1994; Schachter et al., 1994; Seripa et al., 2006) than in younger people, but others found no differ- ences (Asada et al., 1996; Feng et al., 2011; Louhija et al., 2001; Panza et al., 1999). A meta-analysis reported a point estimate of 1.50 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.27, 1.78] and 0.49 (95%CI: 0.41, 0.58) for the frequency of ε2 and ε4-alleles, respectively, in centenarians vs. younger controls,but only studiespublished before2004 were included in the review (Lewis and Brunner, 2004).

2.1.2. Italian cohort

Two groups of Italian subjects born and living in Northern Italy were studied: (i) 79 cases (healthy centenarians, 100–104 years, 40 women, 39 men); and (ii) 597 healthy controls (27–81 years, 315 women, 282 men). The participants' ages were defined by the dates of birth as stated on identity cards. All patients and controls were Caucasian whites ascertained to be of Italian descent. The criterion of ‘Italian descent’ was met when all the parents and grandparents of an individual originated from Italy.

Our purpose was to determine if ApoE is associated with EL. To this end, we compared ApoE allele/genotype frequencies in centenarians (cases) and disease-free controls of the same ethnic and geographic origin among three independent cohorts from Spain, Italy and Japan. We also performed subgroup comparisons (i.e., oldest vs. the rest) within each centenarians' group. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that the ApoE gene may be associated with EL, with the ε2 and ε4-alleles playing favorable and unfavorable roles, respectively.

The Italian centenarians were ascertained mainly via general practi- tioners in the community. These centenarians represent a convenience sample that has been previously described (Emanuele et al., 2010). The history of past and current diseases was accurately collected, checking the centenarians' medical documentation and the current drug therapy. Accordingly, all the Italian centenarians were free of major age-related diseases, i.e., severe cognitive impairment, clinically evident cancer, CVD, renal insufficiency, or severe physical impairment. Only part of this group had decreased visual or auditory acuity. Thus, all of the Italian centenarians were in good health relative to their very ad-

2. Material and methods

2.1. Participants

Writtenconsentwasobtained fromeachparticipant.The studyproto- col was approved by the corresponding institutional ethics committees [European University of Madrid and Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Spanish cohort), University of Pavia (Italian cohort), and National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Medical Research Institute and Keio University (Japanesecohort)]andwasinaccordancewiththeDeclarationofHelsinki for Human Research of 1974 (last modified in 2008).

Controls were in apparent good physical health, with exclusion criteria being: presence of major CVD or cerebrovascular disease, cancer, dementia, chronic autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, renal or hepatic failure, and major psychiatric disorders.

2.1.1. Spanish cohort

Two groups of Spanish subjects (most born and living in the central area of Spain, Meseta Castellana) were investigated: (i) 175 cases (cente- narians, age range 100–111 years, 144 women, 31 men); and (ii) 1081 healthy controls (20–85 years, 622 women, 459 men). All the Spanish participants were of the same Caucasian (Spanish) descent for ≥3 gener- ations and all spoke Spanish as mother language.

2.1.3. Japanese cohort

Two groups of Japanese subjects [of the same Asian (Japanese) descent] were studied: (i) 742 cases (centenarians, 100–116 years, 623 women, 119 men); and (ii) 499 healthy controls (23–59 years, 356 women, 143 men). The group of cases was gathered from two prospective cohorts: the Tokyo Centenarians Study (TCS) and the Semi-Supercentenarians Study in Japan (SSC-J). A detailed description of population-based recruitments for the TCS has been previously re- ported (Gondo et al., 2006). The TCS cohort included 304 centenarians (65 men, 239 women) aged 100–108 years.

Centenarians were living mainly in nursing residencies of the Spanish centralarea, where theywererecruitedduringyears 2009–2012after we hadaccesstotheages'listsofthepeoplelivingintheresidencies.Thepar- ticipants' ages were ascertained by the dates of birth as stated on identity cards. TheirDNAwas obtained fromsalivasamples (Pinos etal., inpress). This group included the oldest European individual (111 years) alive in June 2012 (http://www.grg.org/Adams/E.HTM) and ~7% of the cohort was aged ≥105 years. The most prevalent diseases were osteoarthritis (66%), hypertension (57%), dementia (51%) and cardiovascular disease (29%). Only two centenarians were free of any diagnosed disease.

The SSC-J is a nationwide longitudinal survey consisting mainly of individuals aged 105 years or older, which started in 2002 (with n = 135 SSC). After 2002, the recruitment strategy has relied on re- sponses to local governments and nursing homes in the whole country, and direct inquiries to our research team. Consequently, a total of 450 centenarians (58 men, 392 women) were enrolled in the SSC-J by the end of November 2011. The phenotype and disease characteristics of the Japanese centenarians are described elsewhere (Takayama et al., 2007), with a prevalence of hypertension, CAD and dementia of 63.6%, 28.8% and 59.4%, respectively.

The DNA of 387 younger controls years, 170 women, 217 men) was collected from saliva samples during 2008–2009 in the European University (Madrid, Spain). This was a convenient sample composed of students and staff from this institution; all of them were freeofanymajordisease(includingCVDorAD)andhadnoknownfamily history of high longevity (90+ years), as reported in a questionnaire. The DNA of the remaining part of the control group (n = 794, 68–85 years, 452 women, 242 men) was obtained between October 2011 and April 2013 in the Fundación CIEN (Madrid, Spain) from blood samples of a

plate. TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays for genotype calls were analyzed by using StepOne™ Software v2.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

2.2. Genotype assessment

2.2.1. Spanish cohort

In the cases and younger healthy controls, genomic DNA was extract- ed frombuccal cells according to standard phenol/chloroformprocedures followed by alcohol precipitation. ApoE genotyping was performed with pre-designed Life Technologies TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays on de- mand considering two SNPs: Cys112Arg (rs429358; ID: C_3084793_20) and Arg158Cys (rs7412; ID: C_904973_10). Individuals ε2 were carriers of 112Cys and 158Cys alleles, individuals ε3 were carriers of 112Cys and 158Arg alleles, and individuals ε4 were carriers of 112Arg and 158Arg alleles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed by using a StepOne™ Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA) with a denaturation stage at 95 °C for 10 min, 50 cycles of dena- turation at 92 °C for 15 s, annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min, and a final extension stage of 30 s at 60 °C.

2.3. Statistical analysis

ApoE allele frequencies were calculated from genotypes by using the gene-counting method. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested with the χ2 test. Genotype/allele frequencies were compared between cases and controls in each of the three cohorts by using the Fisher exact test. We compared each genotype and allele with all other genotypes and alleles. We also conducted binary logistic regression adjusted by sex to examine the likelihood of reaching EL if carrying a given allele/ genotype. The same statistical approach was used to perform specific subgroup comparisons among centenarians in each cohort, i.e., oldest quartile vs. the rest of centenarians. A P-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed by using the PASW (v. 18.0 for WINDOWS, Chicago), except for statistical power, which we calculated with the StatMate software, version 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).

For the controls gathered from the Vallecas Project, total DNA was isolated from peripheral blood following standard procedures. Genotyping of ApoE polymorphisms (rs429358 and rs7412) was deter- mined by Real-Time PCR (Calero et al., 2009).

2.2.2. Italian cohort

3. Results

ApoE genotyping was performed from venous blood samples in all subjects (cases and controls) using PCR restriction fragment length poly- morphism (PCR-RFLP) as described previously by Hixson and Vernier (Hixson and Vernier, 1990). In brief, a 244-bp ApoE fragment was ampli- fied by PCR (35 cycles; 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) with the primer pairs: 5′-GATCAAGCTTCCAATCACAGGCAGGA AG-3′ and 5′ GATCCGGCCGCACACGTCCTCCATG-3′. The amplified frag- ment was digested by using HhaI (Promega, Madison, WI) and the prod- ucts were visualized on polyacrylamide gels. Each genotype gives a specific combination of HhaI fragment sizes, i.e., ε2/2: 91 and 83 bp; ε3/3: 91 and 48 bp; ε4/4: 72 and 48 bp and a mixed genotype; ε2/3: 91, 83, and 48 bp; ε3/4: 91, 72 and 48 bp; ε2/4: 91, 83, 72 and 48 bp.

3.1. Spanish cohort

Failure rate of genotypingwas6.9%in cases and 3.9% in controls.The distribution of ApoE genotypes was consistent with the HWE in both groups (cases, P = 0.918; controls, P = 0.910). The results of genotype/ allele frequency distributions as well as of binary logistic regression are shown in Table 1 and summarized below. The frequency of the ε2 or ε3-allele did not differ between cases and controls (P N 0.05). The ε4-allele was less frequent in Spanish cases than in controls (P = 0.027), but no difference was found for the ε4/ε4 genotype (P = 0.608). The ε4-allele was negatively associated with EL [odds ratio (OR) adjusted by sex = 0.55 (95%CI: 0.33–0.94, P = 0.030]. Table 2 shows the results of the subgroup analyses within the centenar- ians' group, with no significant P-value having been found.

2.2.3. Japanese cohort

Samples were genotyped in the genomics laboratory of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (Tokyo, Japan). Total DNA was isolated from venous blood by the use of QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping was performed during Fall 2013 by using custom designed Taqman® SNP genotyping assays [IDs: C___3084793_20 for Cys112Arg (rs429358) and C____904973_10 for Arg158Cys (rs7412)] (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All samples were run in a StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A total of 5 ml genotyping mixture contained 2.5 ml GTXpress™ master mix, 0.125 ml assay mix (40×) and 1.375 ml distilled water to mix with 1 ml genomic DNA (10 ng/ml) in each reaction. One or two negative controls were included on each

Based on the observed prevalence of the ε4-allele in the control group, the Spanish cohort's sample size had a 95% power to detect a relative likelihood of 2.22 for being a centenarian between ε4-allele non-carriers and carriers with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (two-tailed).

3.2. Italian cohort

Rate failure of genotyping was 0%. The distribution of the ApoE genotypes met HWE in the two groups (cases, P = 0.513; controls, P = 0.056). The results of genotype/allele frequency distributions

Table 4 shows the results of the subgroup analyses within the cente- narians' group, which are summarized below.

Based on the observed prevalence of the ApoE ε4 in controls, the Japanese cohort's sample size had a 95% power to detect a relative like- lihood of 1.64 for being a centenarian between ε4-allele non-carriers and carriers with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (two-tailed).

Based on the observed prevalence of the ε4-allele in controls, the Italian cohort's sample size had a 95% power to detect a relative likeli- hood of 3.82 for being a centenarian between ε4-allele carriers and non-carriers with α = 0.05 (two-tailed).

3.4. Analysis of the three cohorts combined

When studying the three cohorts combined, genotype distributions were: ε2/ε2 = 0.4%; ε2/ε3 = 13.9%; ε2/ε4 = 0.4%; ε3/ε3 = 76.9%; ε3/ε4 = 8.0%; and ε4/ε4 = 0.3% (cases) and ε2/ε2 = 0.4%; ε2/ε3 = 8.5%; ε2/ε4 = 0.9%; ε3/ε3 = 74.2%; ε3/ε4 = 14.9%; and ε4/ε4 = 1.1% (controls). The frequency of ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4 genotypes was lower in cases than in controls (P b 0.001 and P = 0.032, respectively) whereas the ε2/ε3 genotype was more frequent in the former (P b 0.001). Allele distributions were: ε2 = 7.6%: ε3 = 87.9%; and ε4 = 4.5% (cases) and ε2 = 5.1%: ε3 = 85.9%; and ε4 = 9.0% (controls).

3.3. Japanese cohort

Failure rate of genotyping was 1.75% in cases and 0.20% in controls. The distribution of ApoE genotypes was consistent with the HWE in both groups (cases, P = 0.111; controls, P = 0.293). The results of geno- type/allele frequency distributions as well as of binary logistic regression are shown in Table 5 and summarized below. The frequency of ε2/ε3 and ε3/ε3 genotypes was higher in cases than in controls (P b 0.01), whereas the frequency of ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4 genotypes was lower in the former

4. Discussion

ε3 = 88.1%; ε4 = 4.6%) are comparable to those previously reported in centenarians of the same country, e.g., ε2 = 4.5%; ε3 = 90.9%; ε4 = 4.5% (Asada et al. 1996).

Ourresultsindicate that theε4-allele wasnegatively associatedwith the likelihood of becoming a centenarian in the three cohorts. A novel finding of our study was that the ε2-allele seems to specifically favor EL in the Italian and Japanese population, although this result was not corroborated in the Spanish cohort. Of note, the ε2-allele might also specifically favor successful or healthy EL in the Italian cohort we studied. This allele was indeed more frequent in Italian centenar- ians, who were free of dementia or any other major age-related condi- tioncompared with their young controls, and was also more frequent in the oldest Italian centenarians than in the rest of this group. More research is however needed in other cohorts of disease-free cente- narians to corroborate the potential benefit of the ε2-allele on healthy EL.

Our results indicate that the ε4-allele is negatively associated with EL, a finding which was corroborated in our three independent cohorts. Some debate exists, with some authors traditionally viewing ApoE more as a ‘frailty’ or ‘disease-risk’ gene than as a longevity gene (Christensen et al., 2006; Fried et al., 2001; Gerdes et al., 2000), with its effects on death theoretically decreasing at very old ages (Christensen et al., 2006).Thisviewisinlinewiththe‘heterogeneityhypothesis’,according to which mortality of individuals carrying the ‘frail’ genotype (e.g., one or more ε4-alleles) in a population will approach that of non-carriers with advancing age because of a selection pressure on carriers; that is, surviving carriers might possess other factors compensating for the ‘frail’genotype,andthusheterogeneitybecomesamoreimportantfactor at old ages than carriage of a given risk-allele (Christensen et al., 2006). However, our results seem to be in support of previous data on Scandi- navian twins showing an increasing mortality risk associated with the ApoE ε4-allele with advancing age (Hjelmborg et al., 2006) or of those showing lower frequency of this allele in centenarians compared with younger controls of French (Blanche et al., 2001; Schachter et al., 1994), Finnish (Louhija et al., 1994), Southern Italian (Panza et al., 1999) or Chinese origin (Feng et al., 2011). Thus, our data seem in agreement with an another hypothesis, the so-called ‘multifactorial threshold model’, according to which many single factors (e.g., carriage of a frail genotype such as one or more ε4-alleles) each with small yet significant effect add up and contribute to a disorder/condition (or death) to happen with age (Jacobsen et al., 2010).

There are large differences in ApoE allele frequencies among geographical areas and populations (Hallman et al., 1991; Singh et al., 2006), e.g., with high relative frequencies of ApoE ε4 in Northern Europe (15–21%), intermediate frequencies in Central Europe (11–13%), and low frequencies in Southern Europe (4–6%) (Lewis and Brunner, 2004). The ε4-allele frequency in our Spanish (10%) and Italian (8%) young controls was relatively higher than that previously reported by Lewis and Brunner (2004) in Southern Europe. Whereas, the ApoE ε4-allele frequency in Spanish and Italian centenarians was 4.9 and 3.2% respectively, which is within the range of previously published frequencies (1–10%) for European centenarians (Blanche et al., 2001; Capurso et al., 2004; Castro et al., 1999; Gerdes et al., 2000; Louhija et al., 1994; Maruszak et al., 2012; Panza et al., 1999; Panza et al., 2003; Schachter et al., 1994; Seripa et al., 2006). On the other hand, al- lele frequencies in the Japanese centenarians studied here (ε2 = 7.3%;

There are several biological mechanisms to postulate ApoE, and particularly the ε4-allele, as a candidate to influence longevity. The

ε4-allele is a well-established risk factor for age-related conditions such as mainly CVD and AD. A meta-analysis including 121 studies showed that this allele is associated with higher CVD risk, coupled with higher plasma cholesterol levels (Bennet et al., 2007). The association with CVD may be the consequence of higher LDL cholesterol and triglyc- eride levels in the plasma of ε4-carriers (Dallongeville et al., 1992). A recent meta-analysis of 21 studies on ApoE polymorphisms and AD concluded that the ε4-allele is strongly associated with a significantly higher risk of sporadic late onset AD (Sadigh-Eteghad et al., 2012). ApoE-lipoproteins bind to several cell-surface receptors to deliver lipids, andalsotohydrophobicamyloid-β(Aβ)peptide,whichisthoughttoini- tiate toxic events that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegenera- tion in AD (Liu et al., 2013). ApoE isoforms differentially regulate Aβ aggregation and clearance in the brain, and have important functions in regulating brain lipid transport, glucose metabolism, neuronal signal- ing, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function (Liu et al., 2013), with the ε4-allele being associated with higher Aβ cellular uptake, lead- ing to more Aβaggregationcompared toε3 (Liu et al., 2013; Smith2002; Verghese et al., 2013).

of dendritic spines and accelerating memory impairments in AD (Hashimoto et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2010). With regards to this, a recent study showed that the levels of Aβ oligomers in AD patients were lowest in those carrying the ε2-allele (Hashimoto et al., 2012). Theε2-allele also seems to play a protective role against CVD (Bennet et al., 2007; Gerdes etal.,2000;Kolovouetal.,2002),thoughtheevidenceisprobablyweaker than for negative effect of the ε4-allele (Drenos and Kirkwood, 2010). In addition, previous large population-based longitudinal studies, i.e., the Rotterdam study (Slooter et al., 2001) and the Danish 1905 birth cohort (Lindahl-Jacobsen et al., 2013) reported no favorable effect of ε2-allele on mortality in the elderly, despite protecting against cognitive decline in the oldest old (≥93 years) (Lindahl-Jacobsen et al., 2013).

Besides the rationale for postulatingthe ApoEas a candidate to ence EL, a major strength of our study was the clear definition we used for the criterion of EL (with all cases beingcentenarians).A novelty with regards to previous research on EL and ApoE stems from the fact that (i) the analyses were conducted in three independent cohorts (with one of them, the Japanese cohort, including a very large sample of centenarians) and(ii)westudiedboth‘normal’andsuperhealthy(Italian)centenarians. Nonetheless, it must be kept in mind that the cross-sectional nature of our design precludes comments on causality and we only concentrated on EL as a categorical trait (i.e., to be centenarian or not) rather than on the continuous life-span, which runs the risk of losing some information. On the other hand, some caution is needed when attempting to extrapo- late our findings to the whole Italian, Spanish or Japanese population be- cause we used mostly convenience samples, which raises the risk of bias due to population stratification. Another limitation from our study stems from the relatively high rate of genotyping failure in the Spanish cohort, particularly in cases. The main reason might lie on the fact that DNA ex- traction from saliva in frail individuals such as centenarians might result in small amounts of DNA available for analyses (we did not collect blood samples based onethicalconstraints). Thus,blood sampling is likelypref- erable in this population segment. Also, two different methodologies were used in the Spanish cohort, i.e., TaqMan® and real-time PCR. With regard to the two aforementioned limitations, we believe the fact that enotype distributions met HWE in the two Spanish groups (cases and controls) and allele/genotype frequencies were similar to those reported in other Southern European cohorts (Blanche et al., 2001; Capurso et al., 2004) supportthevalidityof our data. Finally,interpretationofcase–con- trol studies comparing allele/genotype frequencies among centenarians and younger counterparts may be flawed by differences in date of birth, e.g., 20+ year difference in our cohorts (with centenarians and controls beenbornintheearly1900sandafter1930respectively).Indeed,mortal- ity risk depends on the interaction of genotype with environmental or lifestyle risk factors and the pattern of exposure to such risk factors is re-

The explanation for our novel i.e., that the could benefit EL in the Italian and Japanese population, and specifically favor healthy attainment of EL in the Italian cohort, is less apparent and war- rants further research. The ApoE ε2-allele has previously been reported to be more frequent in centenarians (Blanche et al., 2001; Louhija et al., 1994; Schachter et al., 1994; Seripa et al., 2006) than in younger people, but others found no differences (Asada et al., 1996; Capurso et al., 2004; Fengetal.,2011;Louhijaetal.,2001;Panzaetal.,1999).Ameta-analysis considering only studies of centenarians published before 2004 gave a point estimate of 1.50 (95%CI, 1.27–1.78) for ε2-allele frequency in centenarians vs. younger controls (Lewis and Brunner, 2004). However, scant data are available on the disease status of the centenarians' cohorts of the above-mentioned reports. Capurso et al. (2004) studied Southern-Italian centenarians without dementia, or other chronic neurological or cerebrovascular disease, but found no differ- ences in ApoE genotype frequencies between this group and younger controls. To date, much more data are available on the deleterious role of the ε4-allele, particularly with regards to AD risk, than on a potential protective effect of the ε2-allele. Inheritance of two copies of the ε4-allele is indeed associated with a N10-fold increased risk for de- veloping AD compared to the most common ε3/ε3 genotype (Corder et al., 1993; Strittmatter et al., 1993). There is strong evidence that ApoE ε4 facilitates Aβ deposition, with senile plaque density being significantly higher in the brains of AD ε4/ε4 patients compared with those with the ε3/ε3 genotype (Gomez-Isla et al., 1996; Rebeck et al., 1993). Although Aβ deposition is the pathological hallmark of AD, oligomeric, soluble forms of Aβ have been implicated as the synaptotoxic component,inwhichhigherlevelsofAβoligomersareincreasingtheloss

In summary, our data corroborate that ApoE genotypes are associated with EL. The ε4-allele appears to decrease the likelihood of reaching EL among individuals of different ethnic/geographic backgrounds. An addi- tional finding of our report was that the ε2-allele seems to favor EL in the Italians and Japanese cohorts we studied. Moreover, the ε2-allele seems to specifically favor healthy EL in the Italian cohort we assessed, although this finding remains to be corroborated in other cohorts of disease-free centenarians from the same country and from other parts of the world, and especially in longitudinal studies.
