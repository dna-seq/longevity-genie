METHODS: Participants were 684 twins aged 73(cid:2) years from the 1997 and 1999 surveys of the Longitu- dinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Cognitive skills were assessed by the MMSE, while physical abilities were determined through self-report in 1997 and through both self-report and measurement of perfor- mance in two physical tasks in 1999. Survival status was obtained through linkage with a national death register.

RESULTS: Neither physical nor cognitive performance was associated with ACE genotype at baseline in 1997, or at follow-up in 1999. For participants in both surveys longitudinal changes in these skills did not depend on ACE genotype. The relative risk of dying was increased in II compared with the DI and DD genotype with relative risks of 1.6 (95 percent confidence intervals 1.1–2.5) and 1.3 (0.8–2.1), respec- tively.

INTRODUCTION

DD and heterozygotes DI. The genotype accounts for ap- proximately half of the variance in the circulating ACE level and from the II to the DD genotype the presence of each D allele is associated with an additive effect on ACE activity (50% higher in the DD compared with the II geno- type) (1). The cleavage of angiotensin-I by ACE produces the octapeptide angiotensin-II, which is a potent vasocon- strictor. The relationship between ACE genotypes, in par- ticular DD, and the occurrence of cardiovascular and renal diseases has therefore been the focus of several studies in the past decade. The results from these association studies have not been consistent, and for ischemic heart disease publication bias has recently been shown to be a likely ex- planation for this discrepancy (2).

A polymorphism in the gene coding for Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme (ACE) was identified in 1990 (1). The polymorphism is due to a 287 bp fragment in the ACE gene in chromosome 17. The fragment is present in the in- sertion (I) variant and absent in the deletion (D) variant, which results in the three genotypes: Homozygotes II and

In the past few years the ACE gene polymorphism has also been associated with the outcome of physical exercise, especially endurance performance. Presence of the II geno- type was associated with improved performance (3–6). However, the study subjects were mostly young healthy males from highly selected populations (e.g. elite athletes and military recruits) and the samples were small (3–6).

relationship of ACE genotype to cognitive performance and survival. Due to the well-established association between the I/D genotype and the stepwise phenotypic expression of the ACE gene (1) it could further be hypothesized that any association with examined phenotypes would result in step- wise trends in the differences.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study Population

The population in this study was drawn from the 1997 and 1999 surveys of the longitudinal study of aging Danish twins (LSADT) which has been described in detail else- where (18). In brief, the LSADT began in 1995 and is an ongoing longitudinal study of twins born before 1929 and identified in The Danish Twin Registry. The Danish Twin Registry includes all twins born in Denmark between 1870 and 1910, and same-sex pairs born between 1911 and 1930. The LSADT participants are interviewed every second year in their homes by lay interviewers from the Danish Na- tional Institute of Social Research who have substantial ex- perience in interviewing the elderly. The 1997 survey comprised 2172 individuals corresponding to a participa- tion rate of 78.7 percent. We subsequently asked individu- als from pairs where both twins participated in the  interview study (n 974) to allow a trained technician to visit them in their homes and draw a sample of blood. Blood was sampled from 689 individuals (Fig. 1) and ACE genotype was determined in 554. For 130 monozygotic (MZ) twins, the ACE genotype was determined for one twin in the pair and was then assigned to the co-twin. Genotyping failed due to technical problems in 5 cases. The study population from the 1997 survey therefore con- sisted of 684 individuals of whom 547 were reassessed in 1999 (Fig. 1).

Physical performance is important for younger people but even more so among the elderly where physical perfor- mance together with cognitive function determine whether life can be lived independently. Cognitive impairment and dementia have also been reported to be associated with ACE genotype, although recent studies have come to oppo- site conclusions regarding ACE genotype and risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (7, 8). An increased risk of AD was associated with the I allele in one study (7), but the D allele in another (8).

enced by ACE genotype since a German study found an in- creased frequency of the DD genotype in octogenarians (9). This finding could not, however, be confirmed in two large studies of centenarians (10, 11). Studies of elderly twins have found evidence of substantial genetic influence on both physical (14) and cognitive functioning (15, 16) as well as a moderate genetic influence on life span (17). Twin studies have mostly been used for determining the relative contribution of genes and environment to the variation of a phenotype but less so for identifying specific genetic vari- ants of importance. Based on the previous association stud- ies and the fact that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in cardiovascular and renal homeostasis and that ACE activity and angiotensin receptors can be demon- strated in various peripheral tissues including skeletal mus- cle (12) and brain (13) it seems conceivable that the I/D polymorphism that is associated with the circulating ACE activity could be associated with physical and cognitive function and survival at older ages. We therefore found it relevant to investigate the possible relations of ACE geno- type to physical and cognitive abilities in a large sample of older Danish twins who are being followed longitudinally. This twin cohort provided the evidence for a substantial ge- netic component to the phenotypes we study. Here we use the twin cohort as a longitudinal study of individuals, al- though we take advantage of and pay attention to the de- pendency between the two twins within a pair. Based on the previous literature, it could be hypothesised that the II ACE genotype is associated with better physical perfor- mance in the elderly. Previous studies were not consistent

As twin zygosity was determined through a self-report questionnaire, a method that has been shown to result in less than 5 percent misclassification (19), the number of misclassified MZ twins was very small.

Genotyping

The ACE genotyping was done according to Rigat et al (20). To avoid the earlier reported mistyping of ACE het- erozygotes (ID genotypes misclassified as DD) (21, 22), all samples typed as DD were reamplified as described by Shan- mugam et al (21) with another set of primers in the pres- ence of a positive control (ID/II).

Physical and Cognitive

Physical ability was assessed through self-report in 1997, and through both self-report and the measurement of per- formance in two physical tasks in 1999. The questions re-

ferred to the ability on the day of the interview. Research has shown that physical abilities can be reliably and val- idly assessed through self-report (23). The self-reported physical abilities were determined from 26 items including items from Katz’ index of activities of daily living (ADL) (24) as well as questions about demanding activities like running. This instrument has been validated in Denmark and shown to discriminate different levels of functional abilities among community dwelling elderly (25). All items were rated on a 4 to 1 scale with the response op- tions ranging from “can do without fatigue” (4) to “cannot do” (1). To identify a quantitative subscale the items were factor analyzed in the total twin sample from the 1995 sur- vey (14). This identified two factors where the first factor loaded highest on items dealing with ability to walk, run, climb stairs and carry weights and was interpreted to re- flect a dimension of strength. The second factor loaded highest on items dealing with ability to wash, dress, and get in and out of bed and was interpreted to reflect a di- mension of agility. Only the strength factor was used in this analysis due to little variability on the agility scale.

The strength scores from the 1997 and 1999 surveys were calculated by taking the average response of the 11 items identified to be relevant for this score. The factor has pre- viously been found highly reliable for functional abilities (26). In the 1999 survey three additional items dealing with endurance performance (self-reported walking, run- ning and cycling distance) were included. A composite score was calculated taking the average response from these items.

In the 1999 survey the participants were also invited to perform two tests of physical abilities—maximum handgrip pressure and the repeated chair stand test. The grip strength was measured by a hand dynamometer (Smedley’s dyna- mometer TTM, Tokyo). The maximum value of three mea- sures with each hand was used in the analyses. In the repeated chair stand test the participants were asked to rise and sit five times from a chair as quickly as possible with their arms folded over their chest. The pulse was recorded immediately before and after the test. The test, which was timed, was stopped if five attempts were not successfully performed within 60 seconds.

age was 78.2 with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.4 (females: 78.4 (4.6), males: 77.8 (4.0)). Sixteen (2.3 percent) partici- pated in the interview through a proxy responder.

The cognitive functioning of the participants was as- sessed using the mini mental state examination (MMSE), which was integrated in the interview.

Data Analyses

ACE Genotype

In all, 169 (24.7 percent) twins had the II genotype, 344 (50.3 percent) the DI, and 171 (25.0 percent) the DD gen- otype. The genotype frequencies in men and women, and in the age groups shown in Table 1, were in Hardy-Wein- berg equilibrium (p > | 0.3), and were highly comparable to proportions found in Danish populations in two previous studies (10, 28). The distribution of the ACE genotype in the MZ twins who were assigned to their co-twin’s geno- type did not differ from that of the other study subjects (re- sults not shown).

Allele frequencies were computed from the genotype frequen- cies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested by a (cid:4)2 test with one degree of freedom. We compared the three ACE- genotypes with regard to physical and cognitive abilities and other characteristics at baseline (1997 interview wave) and in 1999 at the second interview wave. Longitudinal changes in cognitive skills and physical abilities were examined for twins participating in both interview waves. Finally, we examined the influence of ACE-genotype on survival through linkage with mortality data for the entire cohort.

Continuous variables were compared using multivariate linear regression models and categorical data were com- pared using logistic regression models controlling for the age of the participants. To account for the non-indepen- dence of the observations on twins, twins from pairs where both participated (intact pairs) were analyzed as clusters of two in the multivariate models (27). Data were sex-strati- fied due to a tendency to a larger proportion of women among the DI and DD genotypes.

Baseline Characteristics

Characteristics of the study population, which could poten- tially confound the association between ACE genotype and measures of physical and cognitive abilities and survival, are listed in Table 1. The distribution of most of these po- tential confounders between the ACE genotypes was highly comparable and the differences showed no stepwise trends across genotypes. However, the number with more than eight years of education was significantly higher in DD  than in DI and II males, p 0.02 (Table 1). In addition, the proportion with poor or very poor self-rated health was me)  lower in ID than DD males, p 0.02 (Table 1).

sampling and until emigration, death, or end of study pe- riod (January 1, 2001), whichever event came first. Infor- mation on emigration and death was retrieved from the Danish Central Population Register, which is continuously updated. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, and the influ- ence of ACE genotype on survival was ascertained using the log-rank test. Subsequently, a Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was undertaken to determine ACE gen- otype as an independent risk factor controlling for the ef- fects of sex, age, cognitive function (MMSE score), and self-rated health. These parameters were included in the analysis because they were associated with ACE genotype and survival. Education, which also differed by ACE geno- type, was omitted from the final model, as it did not contrib- ute significantly in explaining survival. The proportionality assumption was confirmed with a log minus log survival function plot.

Physical Abilities

Self-reported data about physical abilities were obtained from 683 individuals. The median strength scores from the two surveys as well as their mean relative difference did not vary substantially by ACE genotype (Table 2). The com- posite endurance score of self-reported walking, running, and cycling from the 1999 survey did not differ by ACE genotype (Table 2). The maximum handgrip pressure was measured in 488 individuals with a mean-grip strength (SD) of 24.4 kg (8.6). Grip strength was highly dependent on sex, age, height and weight, but since height and weight were comparable in the three ACE genotypes (Table 1) this measure was analyzed age-adjusted and sex-stratified as other physical performance measures. Mean grip strength did not vary by ACE genotype (Table 2). The chair stand test was successfully completed by 426 individuals. The mean time (SD) used was 12.5 seconds (4.5) and the mean increase in pulse after five chair stands was 7.8 (4.8) heart- beats per minute. Both the time used to complete the test and the increase in pulse were highly comparable in the ACE genotypes (Table 2). The proportion of twins unable to perform the grip-strength and chair stand test did not vary by genotype (results not shown).

The physical and cognitive functioning and survival among individuals from intact dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs that were discordant for ACE genotype were finally com- pared using the Sign test.

Study Population

The population comprised 684 individuals (Fig. 1), 450 (65.8 percent) females and 234 (34.2 percent) males. The mean

body anaerobic response (31) after physical training in II persons exceeding that of the D allele persons. The associa- tion studies have determined ACE genotype prevalence in élite athletes compared with controls. Some have found in- creased prevalence of the II genotype in mountaineers who ascended beyond 7,000 m without supplementary oxygen (3) or in Olympic competitors (5, 6), whereas others found no difference in ACE genotype prevalence (32). All the in- tervention studies have as expected found comparable physical performance at baseline between different ACE genotypes since the range of physical abilities is narrow in young persons especially when using selected groups e.g. military recruits for the intervention. In old age, however, the variation of physical abilities is large, therefore differ- ences in a cross-sectional study should occur if the ACE genotype was important for physical performance in this age group. Furthermore, ACE genotype was not associated with rate of change in self-reported physical abilities. The cause of the discrepancy between this and the previous studies is unknown. A possible explanation could be the highly selected populations used in the previous studies of ACE genotype and physical performance.

Subgroup Analyses

Seventy-nine intact DZ twin pairs were discordant for ACE genotype. Physical and cognitive abilities as well as survival did not differ significantly between the individuals in these pairs (results not shown). Although statistics were not sig- nificant here, the proportion of self-reported diseases dif- fered by genotype (Table 1). We therefore repeated the analyses restricted to those not suffering from any of the mentioned diseases but the results were virtually unaltered by this (results not shown).

DISCUSSION

In this study, we have focused on the possible association of the ACE genotypes with physical and cognitive perfor- mance and survival among the elderly. The study design provided both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. In our study, the ACE genotype was not associated with self-reported or measured physical performance or cognitive function. Having the D allele, however, improved chances of survival even after controlling for the effect of sex, age, cognitive function, and self-rated health. None of the analyses re- vealed any stepwise trends of the examined phenotypes with regard to ACE genotype.

We found no association between ACE genotype and cognitive function with the cross-sectional and the longitu- dinal approach. The previous studies have focused on the re- lation between ACE genotype and dementia and have come to quite different conclusions. The risk of dementia (all types) or AD have thus been reported to be increased with the I allele (7), and the D allele, but confined to the age group 66 to 71 years (8), or to the male sex (33), and to have no association with ACE genotype (34, 35). We studied as- sociations between ACE genotype and cognitive function on a continuous scale. Only one other cross-sectional study has examined the association between ACE genotype and MMSE score and failed as in the present study to show any relation between genotype and cognition (36).

twins were alive at baseline, which could introduce selec- tion bias. However, physical abilities in old twin pairs where both twins were alive have previously been shown only marginally better than in twins with a deceased co- twin (14). The instrument to determine physical perfor- mance in this study was self-report and measurements of upper and lower extremity function. This gives information from several functions each important for physical perfor- mance, none of which showed an association with ACE genotype. The assessment of physical abilities through self- report was done with a questionnaire that has been vali- dated in a Danish population on several occasions. Further, the reliability of self-reported physical functioning in the elderly is reported to be high (23). Both physical perfor- mance measures (grip strength and repeated chair stands) have been used in other studies among the elderly and have been shown to discriminate different levels of physical functioning (29, 30). All the previous association studies comparing physical performance with ACE genotype have studied young healthy individuals. Two different types of studies have been used: intervention and association stud- ies. Among male military recruits the intervention studies have found improved muscular function (3, 4) and whole

One study found a significantly larger proportion of DD’s among octogenarians (9), whereas in a study of 9203 persons from the Copenhagen City heart study (28) and in two stud- ies of centenarians (10, 11) the DD proportion was similar in the age groups compared. We studied mortality longitudi- nally and found an increased mortality among II’s in old age. To our knowledge, only one longitudinal study has investi- gated survival in relation to ACE genotype in 61 patients with renovascular disease where the DD patients had a poorer survival than the ID patients (37). The small differ- ence in the survival curves in the present study indicates that the ACE genotype does not have a major impact on survival and that the poorer II survival may reflect random variation. In conclusion, we found no substantial effects of ACE

In conclusion, we found no substantial effects of ACE genotype on physical and cognitive performance in neither the cross-sectional nor the follow-up study. Persons with
