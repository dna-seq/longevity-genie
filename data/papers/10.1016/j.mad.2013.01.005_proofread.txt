ABSTRACT 

Despite evidence of a substantial genetic component, the genetic factors that underlie longevity in humans remain to be identified. Previous genome-wide linkage and association studies have not found strong evidence for the contribution of common variants besides the APOE gene. This suggests the role of rare variants in human longevity. To discover rare variants that might contribute to longevity, we selected 988 candidate genes and performed a pilot study to identify novel non-synonymous variants in six Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians older than 105. Our candidate genes act in pathways implicated in aging and longevity including neurodegeneration, cognitive function, lipid metabolism, DNA repair and genome maintenance. By implementing custom-designed Agilent SureSelect target capture and next-generation sequencing techniques we discovered a total of 89 novel non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and validated 51 nsSNPs by iPLEX MassArray assays. Genotyping analysis of these novel SNPs in 410 Ashkenazi Jewish controls and 390 centenarians showed significant enrichment (5.3 fold, p = 0.02) of the p.Y318C variant in PMS2 and significant depletion (7.5 fold, p = 0.04) of the p.V465A variant in GABRR3 in centenarians compared to controls. Our study presents the potential of targeted next-generation sequencing for discovery of rare but functional genetic variation which may lead to exceptional longevity in humans.

1. Introduction 

Alzheimer's disease (AD), cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes occur more frequently in the elderly population as compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Therefore, centenarians have been utilized as a model system for genetic studies of human longevity, with extreme age used as a phenotype to discover genetic variations predisposing people to longevity. Genetic studies of centenarians are based on the premise that they may lead to the identification of alleles that are either particularly enriched in these populations due to positive effects on extreme longevity or under-represented due to negative impact on human health (Tazearslan et al., 2012). 

Longevity is known to have a genetic component. The heritability of average life expectancy has been estimated to be 15-25% (Murabito et al., 2012). Family studies on centenarians, those who are 100 years of age or above, suggest that the relationship between genetics and longevity is stronger in the oldest-old adults (Perls et al., 2002; Robine and Allard, 1998). For example, male and female siblings of centenarians have 17 and 8 times, respectively, greater probability of surviving to age 100 than the siblings of people who have an average life expectancy (Perls et al., 2002). Furthermore, offspring of centenarians are healthier with a lower prevalence of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes, as compared to age- and gender-matched controls. 

Genome-wide analyses have been performed to identify genomic regions linked to longevity followed by identification of the genetic variation causal to the trait. Both genome-wide linkage studies (GWLS) in family-based designs and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in population-based designs confirmed the role of APOE alleles in human longevity. These studies suggest that centenarians are likely to harbor rare protective variants with strong effects (Deelen et al., 2011; Passtoors et al., 2012). Considering the frequency of centenarians is only approximately 1/5000 individuals in the population (Andersen et al., 2012), these alleles may not be detectable in general populations. Indeed, a. Introduction
Stability is crucial for longevity, and evidence suggests that genome maintenance plays a significant role in ensuring it (Vijg and Suh, 2005). Defects in DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, homologous recombination, nonhomologous end joining, mismatch repair, and telomere maintenance, as well as genes regulating these pathways, lead to premature aging and shorter life spans in humans and mice (Garinis et al., 2008; Martin, 2005; Thomson and Guerra-Rebollo, 2010). Recent technology advancements have made it possible to identify genetic variations in the entire genome, including rare causal variants with large effects in population-based studies. However, the high cost and bioinformatics challenges of analyzing whole genome sequencing data can be overcome by taking a candidate approach to comprehensively sequence hundreds to thousands of genes implicated in aging and longevity pathways. Here we used a target capture and next-generation sequencing to discover rare but potentially causal variants in 988 candidate genes in six Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians older than 105 years of age. We selected candidate genes from neurodegeneration/cognitive function, lipid metabolism, DNA damage repair, and genome maintenance pathways because they are involved in pathways that have demonstrated roles in aging and longevity. We report the discovery and validation of novel non-synonymous variants discovered in six centenarians and further genotyping and association analysis of these variants in 410 controls and 390 centenarians of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

There is increasing evidence that longevity genes protect against cognitive decline, dementia, and neurodegeneration including AD (Barzilai et al., 2006; Christensen et al., 2006; Sanders et al., 2010), consistent with the epidemiologic finding that dementia is absent or markedly delayed among centenarians (age of onset >93 years) (Hitt et al., 1999). For example, a functional longevity allele (p.I405V) in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene is significantly associated with slower memory decline and lower risk for dementia and AD (Sanders et al., 2010). In addition, centenarians are enriched with the AD-protective APOE e2 allele, while they are depleted of the AD-predisposing APOE e4 allele (Christensen et al., 2006). Remarkably, a recent GWAS has demonstrated that SNPs associated with longevity are most significantly enriched in genes related to AD, dementia, and tauopathies (Sebastiani et al., 2012). Furthermore, genetic variations associated with longevity have been associated with beneficial lipid profiles. The APOE protein functions as a lipid transporter, and the APOE e2 allele was associated with a beneficial lipid profile and lower risk of coronary heart disease (Bennet et al., 2007). Longevity-associated variation (p.I405V) in the lipid transfer protein CETP was associated with larger particle size of LDL and HDL (Barzilai et al., 2003), and lipoprotein particle size was significantly increased among centenarians and their offspring compared to controls (Barzilai et al., 2003; Vaarhorst et al., 2011). The frequency of homozygotes for the 641C allele in the apolipoprotein-C3 (APOC3) promoter was higher in centenarians and their offspring when compared to controls (Atzmon et al., 2006). Therefore, we selected genes involved in pathways implicated in neurodegeneration, cognitive function, and lipid metabolism as our candidate genes.

2. Materials and Methods
In total, we used 800 human samples in this study: 410 Ashkenazi Jewish controls and 390 Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians previously collected as part of a longevity study by Dr. Nir Barzilai of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Barzilai et al., 2003). We obtained informed written consent in accordance with the policy of the Committee on Clinical Investigations of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. A centenarian is defined as a healthy individual living independently at 95 years of age or older, and a control is defined as an individual without a family history of unusual longevity; parents of controls survived to the age of 85 years or less. The control group largely consisted of spouses of the offspring of centenarians. For target capture and next-generation sequencing of our candidate genes, we used genomic DNA extracted from immortalized B-lymphocytes.

2.2. Target selection and generation of customized target capture
For sequencing, we selected 988 genes implicated in the pathways of aging and longevity in humans. The rationale for selection and their criteria are described in Section 3.1 under Results. The complete list of thecorrectly detect the variants. Further analysis showed that the confirmed nsSNPs were present in a heterozygous state in the centenarians, with allele frequencies ranging from 0.10 to 0.47. To test whether these nsSNPs were enriched in centenarians compared to controls, we genotyped them in a larger sample set consisting of 192 centenarians and 192 controls. Association analysis showed that three nsSNPs were significantly associated with longevity after Bonferroni correction (p < 5.13 Ã— 10-4), including rs145072688 (p.Arg87His) in GPR50, rs1801133 (p.Cys677Tyr) in MTHFR, and rs17185536 (p.Arg1174Gln) in FLT1. These findings suggest that these novel nsSNPs may play a role in human longevity and warrant further investigation.

2.3. Library preparation, target enrichment, and sequencing
We isolated DNA from immortalized B-lymphocytes established from six centenarians and generated libraries for Illumina sequencing. Each library was indexed with a unique barcode, which allowed for target capture and enrichment of pooled libraries and multiplex sequencing. The library preparation and enrichment methods were performed according to the Agilent Illumina Paired-End Sequencing Platform Library Prep Protocol, with the following modifications: (1) genomic DNA was sheared with Covaris system for 250 bp; (2) Illumina adapters were replaced with custom-made, indexed adapters supplied by IDT DNA (see Supplementary Table S2 for adapter sequence information); (3) size-selection and DNA elution were performed by precast E-gel (Invitrogen) SizeSelect 2% with E-gel precast gel cassette, and fragments with the desired size (300-350 bp) were eluted with 25 ml water; (4) for the pre-capture enrichment PCR, DNA was amplified in eight cycles; (5) post-enriched DNA libraries were combined in equal amounts to a total quantity of 1 mg; (6) the hybridization mixture was incubated for 24 h at 65Â°C to minimize evaporation. Target-enriched libraries were sent to Axeq Technologies and sequenced paired-end on the Illumina HiSeq2000 with cluster kit v2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reads generated were 101 bp in length.

Accumulation of DNA damage and mutations has been considered an important causal factor in age-related deterioration and death (Garinis et al., 2008; Hoeijmakers, 2009). This concept is in keeping with the proposed evolutionary basis of aging, i.e., the declining force of natural selection with age, which does not predict maximization of cellular maintenance and repair (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 2002). DNA damage continuously occurs by both endogenous and exogenous sources, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced as byproducts of metabolism, UV light, and ionizing radiation. DNA damage is known to cause aging-related cellular degeneration and diseases. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling pathway modulates DNA damage and stress response and is well-established as a conserved pathway of aging (Kenyon, 2010; Tazearslan et al., 2012).

2.4. Data analysis
We used the Agilent eArray to design and assess coverage across the target genomic regions of bait libraries. Design efficiency from eArray was 99%, calculated as the covered fraction of target bases in the oligo design (6,229,389 bp), out of the total submitted target regions (6,291,136 bp). The final customized target capture contained 5,692,804 bp covering the target regions of the 988 candidate genes.

Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome revision hg19 (Lander et al., 2001) using BWA version 0.5.9 (Li and Durbin, 2009), with setting "-q 17" provided when running the "aln" command. Following alignment, we utilized Picard [http://picard.sourceforge.net] to detect potential PCR duplicates and to calculate on-target statistics. Subsequent processing was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (McKenna et al., 2010). To call variants, we first preprocessed the dataDetect heterozygote calls in the same individuals in which the novel nsSNPs were initially discovered, as well as in a larger number of controls (n = 410) and centenarians (n = 390) (Fig. 1B). 

3.3. Genotyping and association analysis of novel nsSNPs in 410 controls and 390 centenarians 

2.5. Genotyping 

To validate novel nsSNPs discovered in six centenarians, we designed iPLEX MassArray assays (Sequenom) using the web-based assay design suite program on the mysequenom website (http://www.mysequenom.com). From a total of 89 novel nsSNPs, 67 nsSNPs were designed for iPLEX assays in four separate multiplexing groups based on the high quality of peaks visualized in the MassARRAY Typer software after performing MassArray. Using the iPLEX assays, genotyping was performed in 410 controls and 390 centenarians at the Genomics Shared Facility at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. 

Using the established iPLEX assays, we performed genotyping analysis in 410 controls and 390 centenarians. The result from allelic analysis is shown in Table 2 with alleles ranked according to nominal p-values by Fisher's exact test. We found a total of 13 nsSNPs that were detected only in centenarians but not in controls. These include 11 nsSNPs (c.1469G > T in PCDH10, c.10501A > G in DNAH1, c.768G > A in SHC1, c.484G > A in GRIA3, c.1343T > C in CHRNG, c.41G > C in IL1A, c.991G > A in OPRK1, c.1453C > T in PCDH12, c.1024A > G in USP24, c.634T > G in CHEK2, and c.109A > G in GRIK2) that were detected only in the initial discovery panel of six centenarians (minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.1%) and two nsSNPs (c.1172C > T in ZMIZ1 and c.118C > T in PLCD4) for which additional centenarians were also found to be carriers. Most of the novel nsSNPs were rare with MAF less than 1%, and thus significance of rare alleles could not be estimated with the current sample size. Notably, MAF of the c.1394T > C in GABRR3 was significantly higher in controls compared to centenarians (1.25% vs. 0.13%, p = 0.01). MAFs of some of the novel nsSNPs reached up to 5%, e.g., c.1021G > A in FOXO3, but none of them showed significant differences in frequencies between controls and centenarians. Genotypic analysis identified two novel nsSNPs (c.953A>G in PMS2 and c.1394T>C in GABRR3) that were significantly different between controls and centenarians (Table 3). Heterozygote genotype frequency for the c.953A>G variant in PMS2 was 0.5% in controls compared to 2.64% in centenarians (5.3 fold difference, p = 0.02), while that of c.1394T>C variant in GABRR3 was higher in controls than in centenarians (2.02% and 0.27%, p = 0.04). No other genotypes showed significant differences in frequencies between controls and centenarians. 

2.6. Statistical analysis 

The association analyses were performed using SNP & Variation Suite version 7.6.11 (Golden helix). For a basic allelic test, the genotypes dd, Dd, and DD were resolved into pairs of alleles d and d, D and d, or D and D. Both elements of each subject's genotype are considered to correspond to the same value of the dependent variable. The associations with these individual alleles are then tested. For a genotypic test, the genotypes dd, Dd, and DD were tested without regard to any order, allelic count, or allelic pairing they might have. Statistical differences among groups were assessed by Fisher's exact test, for both allelotype and genotype distribution comparisons. A two-tailed p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. 

3. Results 

3.1. Discovery of novel nsSNPs in 988 candidate genes from six centenarians 

Analysis of the results from target capture and next-generation sequencing of six centenSNPs were successfully genotyped in multiplex assays for 410 controls and 390 centenarians. Out of 67 nsSNPs that were assayable for genotyping, 51 were validated as real variants. The genotyping analysis of these variants indicated that most of the novel nsSNPs had low frequency. A novel nsSNP in PMS2 (p.Y318C) was significantly enriched in centenarians (5.3 fold difference, p = 0.02), while a novel nsSNP in GABRR3 (p.V465A) was significantly depleted in centenarians (7.5 fold difference, p = 0.04), as compared to controls.

PMS2 is a component of the post-replicative DNA repair (MMR) system and is involved in apoptosis in the case of major DNA damage. Defects in this gene are involved in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer type 4 (HNPCC4). Mice defective in this gene have a high mutation frequency but do not appear to age more rapidly than normal. Recent reports show that PMS2 deficiency prolonged the mean lifespan and median survival of telomerase-deficient mice concomitant with rescue of degenerative pathologies.

The PMS2 amino acid change (p.Y318C) was predicted to be possibly damaging or deleterious according to the in silico tools, SIFT and PolyPhen2, which predict the possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure or function of a protein. In addition, protein structural modeling of the PMS2 nsSNP suggests that the side chain of Y318 is exposed and could be mediating interactions with other factors.

Table 2 shows the allelotypic analysis of novel nsSNPs in 410 controls and 390 centenarians. Out of the 67 nsSNPs that were assayable for genotyping, 29 had a minor allele count of less than 1% in both controls and centenarians.NM_001142769 c.4669A>G p.K1557E 3 (0.38) 1 (0.13) 0.63 POLI

In human aging and longevity, the amino acid change (p.V465A) in GABRR3 was predicted to be benign according to the SIFT and PolyPhen2. However, the variation occurs at residue 465 of a 467 amino acid integral membrane protein. Transmembrane-predicting programs suggest that this residue will be right at the end of the last transmembrane helix. It is conceivable that V to A substitution might introduce minor flexibility in this region by leaving a hydrophobic pocket to fill. If the C-terminus interacts with a factor like a PDZ domain, which recognizes C-terminal sequence motifs, it could have an impact on GABBR3 function. Further functional analysis will be needed to uncover molecular mechanisms by which these variants lead to changes in protein function and contribute to longevity.

Interestingly, none of the reported mutations from HNPCC patients are near this region, suggesting that the centenarian-specific nsSNP may have a gain-of-function property beneficial to long lifespan.

GABRR3 encodes the rho3 subunit of GABA-rho A receptor, which is composed of five subunits. The five subunits can be made up with any three kinds of subunit (rho 1, 2, 3) as a homo-hetero pentamer complex. The GABA-rho receptor is a kind of ionotropic GABA receptor which responds to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). About of neurons in the hippocampus are inhibitory and most of them are GABAergic. It was reported that there was an aging-related change in GABA receptor composition and that the GABA receptor could be relevant to AD pathogenesis (Rissman and Mobley, 2011).

The discovery of significant depletion of GABRR3 (p.V465A) in centenarians as compared to controls suggests its potential role in longevity. We also identified 13 novel nsSNPs that were detected only in centenarians but not in controls (Table 2), although none of them...

Han et al./Mechanisms of Ageing and Development xxx (201analysis of 6 centenarians revealed a total of 7027 genetic variations in 988 candidate genes, excluding variations annotated as ncRNAs. Among these, we identified 89 novel nsSNPs, of which 67 were assayed for validation and genotyping by iPLEX MassArray method. We found that these novel nsSNPs were rare in our populations. Nevertheless, we validated 51 novel nsSNPs (76%) as true positives. Our customized target capture and next-generation sequencing can reproducibly detect genetic variation in candidate genes. This licensing for a large-scale genetic discovery study to identify all possible variations, including rare variants, in a cost-effective manner. We hope to identify regulatory regions, including 2 kb proximal promoter, exonintron junctions, and 50 and 30 UTRs since our targets contain them. We detected additional centenarians harboring the p.P391L variant in ZMIZ1 or the p.L40F variant in PLCD4 that were predicted to be damaging or deleterious by SIFT and PolyPhen2 analysis. There were also 11 variants detected only in the discovery panel of 6 centenarians. Interestingly, all but the p.I342V variantin USP24 were predicted to be functional by the SIFT or PolyPhen2 analysis.
