Abstract

The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), which locates on chromosome 19, has three common APOE alleles encoding APOE*2, APOE*3, APOE*4. It has been considered to be closely associated with human longevity among Western population. However, the allele frequency varies among racial and ethnic groups. We studied the relationship between APOE and longevity among 1562 Han Chinese (246 female and 1316 male) whose ages ranged from 20–108 years old in Shanghai metropolitan area and Lian Yungang, Jiangsu province. % APOE was amplified by one-stage PCR using the forward primer: 5 -GGC ACG GCT GTC % % % CAA GGA GCT-3 and reverse primer: 5 -GAT GGC GCT GAG GCC GCG CT-3 . The PCR product was digested directly with 5 U of CfoI and separated by a 20% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide(cid:30)29:1) nondenaturing gel. The allele frequency of APOE*4in the

1. Introduction

Many factors relating to longevity have been studied in the past and it has been argued that genes play a key role in the aging process. At present, two main developments in support of the hypothesis (Jazwinski, 1996) can be found. The first one was from efforts to test evolutionary theories of aging and the second one arose from studies of genes modulating life span. Smith and Walford (1977) and Walford and Bergmann (1979) found the evidence that the main histocompatibility genes H-2 in mice had played an important role in life-span by inducing an appropriate immune response or by influencing DNA repair capacity. Although there is evidence in support of the contention that a genetic component contributes to the determination of human longevity, the only association reported so far is the HLA locus, which was reported by three independent investigations (Proust et al., 1982; Takata et al., 1987; Yong-Xing et al., 1997). In order to search for genetic influences on human longevity in Han Chinese, we studied a candidate gene, Apolipoprotein E (apoE) which had been well characterized in the Western population.

2.1. Subjects

Blood samples were collected from 1562 health people (246 female and 1316 male, Table 1) with ages ranging from 20 to 108 years old. A total of 1506 unrelated samples were gathered from Shanghai area and 56 people were selected : from Lian Yungang city, Jiangsu province, 600 km away from Shanghai. The selected healthy subjects must meet the following criteria: good physical and mental health confirmed by clinical, radiological, biological examinations and a brief cognitive test (Ming-Yuan et al., 1990).

Regarding their ages, all subjects were divided into the following subgroups: youth (20–39 years old), middle (40–59 years old), old (60–84 years old) and very ] old ( 85 years old) age group, respectively.

The acid citrate dextrose (ACD) was used as anticoagulant (Sambrook et al.,

2.3.1. Isolation of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples

The protocol for isolation of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples in this study was the same as that described by Russell (1989), except for some m minor modifications. Briefly, 100 l anticoagulent peripheral blood was mixed with 0.8 ml lysis buffer in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube and cen- trifuged at 13000(cid:29)g for 0.5 min; the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended using vortex mixer after adding another 0.8 ml of lysis buffer to centrifuge at 13000(cid:29)g for 0.5 min; After removing the supernatant, the pellet m was resuspended in 50 l of PCR buffer and incubated at 60°C for 1.5 h and at 95°C for another 15 min to inactivate the proteinase K. The solution was ready for PCR amplification directly.

Amplification of APOE gene region encoding common APOE isoforms from genomic DNA was conducted in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus % 9600) using oligonucleotide primers (forward primer: 5 -GGC ACG GCT GTC % % CAA GGA GCT-3 and reverse primer: 5 -GAT GGC GCT GAG GCC GCG % CT-3 ). Each amplification reaction contained 100 ng of genomic DNA, 8 pmol of m each primer, 5 l of 10(cid:29) PCR reaction buffer, 10% (v:v) dimethylsulfoxide m (Sigma), 200 mol:l of dATP, dTTP, dCTP and dGTP (Merk), 2 U of Taq m polymerase in a final volume of 50 l. Each reaction mixture was denatured at

94°C for 2 min and subjected to five cycles of amplification by primer annealing (67°C for 10 s), extension (72°C for 80 s) and denaturation (94°C for 10 s). Immediately after completing this mini-cycle, the reaction mixture was continuously subjected to 30 cycles of amplification by primer annealing (60°C for 5 s), extension (72°C for 80 s) and denaturation (94°C for 10 s). The length of PCR product was 262 bp.

2.4. Analysis of amplified APOE product with RFLP

m After PCR amplification, 12 l of each unpurified PCR product was directly digested with 5 U of CfoI at 37°C for overnight. The digested product was loaded onto a 20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide(cid:30)29:1) with 1 mm thick(cid:29)7 cm long for 2.5 h running under constant voltage (150 V). After electrophoresis, the gel was treated with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg:l) for 6 min and DNA fragments were visualized by UV illumination. The sizes of CfoI fragments were determined by the marker (MspI-digested pUC18 DNA) (Hixon and Vernier, 1990; Wenham et al., 1991).

Although the total length of PCR product was different from that obtained by Hixon and Vernier (1990) due to the difference of reverse primer, the length for APOE typing was same as Hixon since the surplus of the base pair was cut off at another CfoI cleavage site contained in the reverse primer.

The data base was reconstructed by using Microsoft Excel software. Allele frequencies were calculated by allele counting. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested by a x2 goodness of fit test. The other data were compared by a x2 test. The computer software of Epi Info 5.01 Chinese edition was also used in the analysis.

3. Results

Table 2 shows distribution of APOE allele genotype in the different age groups (male group); Table 3 shows distribution of APOE allele genotype in the different age groups (female group); Table 4 shows distribution of APOE allele genotype in the different age groups (male(cid:27)female); Table 5 shows the distributions of APOE*2, APOE*3 and APOE*4 allele frequencies. The allele frequency of APOE*4 in the very old group is significantly lower than that in the youth, middle and old group (2.5% vs 8.4, 7.9 or 7.6%; x2 (cid:30)4.6, 4.2 or 4.2; P(cid:30)0.03, 0.04 or 0.04), respectively.

The allele and genotype frequencies were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium by \ comparison with that of the corresponding theoretical distribution (P 0.05, Table

4. Discussion

ApoE is one of the major protein constituents in very low density lipoprotein and plays a central role in lipid metabolism. It is the product of a single gene on : chromosome 19 with the molecular weight of 34000 kDa glycoprotein which is composed of 299 amino acid residues (Mahley, 1988).

The APOE allele frequencies have been found to associate with some kind of diseases. Three common alleles of APOE are APOE*2, APOE*3 and

with 112 cys and 158 cys, it forms isoform APOE*2 which is a risk factor for type III hyperlipidemia (Breslow et al., 1982).

Although the association between APOE polymorphism, in particular the rela- tive proportion of APOE*4 and age-related pathologies have been investigated in Western populations (Davignon et al., 1988; Schachter et al., 1994; Kervinen et al., 1994), few publications in international journals on the study of relation- ship between APOE polymorphism and longevity in Han Chinese population, the largest population in the world, can be found. This should be the first report on the detailed studies of APOE polymorphism and longevity in Han Chinese population.

Our data shows significantly lower frequency of APOE*4 allele in the very old ] ( 85 years old) Han Chinese group compared to the other groups, this is in accordance with the studies by Davignon et al. (1988) in Canadian octogenari- ans and Kervinen et al. (1994) in Finnish nonagenarians. However, our results do not show the significantly higher frequency of APOE*2 allele in the very old ] ( 85 years old) Han Chinese, although Schachter et al. (1994) found not only a decrease in the APOE*4 allele frequency but also an increase in the APOE*2 allele frequency in French centenarians. This may be due to the ethnic differ- ence.

With discovery of the premature aging gene (Chang-En et al., 1996), biogerontologists are encouraged to find longevity gene combined with our data and colleagues’ data to elucidate the mechanisms of longevity or aging in detail.
