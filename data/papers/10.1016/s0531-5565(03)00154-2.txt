Abstract

Variants of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 1 (ACE1) gene and the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) have been suggested to be associated with human longevity. We tested the association between the ACE1 insertion (I allele)/deletion (D allele) polymorphism and longevity in a population from Southern Italy and examined the impact of geographical variation on ACE1 allele frequencies on reported associations from other European countries. ACE1 and APOE genotypes were obtained on 82 centenarians and 252 middle-aged, unrelated subjects or volunteers. No statistically significant differences were found in ACE1 genotype or allele frequencies between centenarians and controls in this Southern Italian population nor was there any observed interaction with APOE alleles that are also reputed to be linked to longevity. However, decreasing gradients in ACE1*I allele frequencies, both in centenarians and controls, with concomitant increases in ACE1*D allele frequencies (particularly the ACE1*D/*D genotype) were observed to be statistically significant from Northern to Southern regions of Europe. These findings did not support the previously reported association between ACE1 polymorphism and longevity. However, there were interesting and significant differences, as one moves from Northern to Southern Europe, with regard to the distribution of ACE1 alleles. Such genetic differences in conjunction with differing environmental factors may explain in part previous results suggesting a role of this polymorphism in longevity.

1. Introduction

The angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipepti- dase A) 1 (ACE1) gene, located on chromosome 17, has an insertion (I allele)/deletion(D allele) genetic polymorphism in its non-coding region (Rigat et al., 1990) and has been recently associated with an increased risk for development of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Kehoe et al., 1999). Homozygosity of the ACE1*D allele has also been associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) (Cambien et al., 1992). Findings of a higher pre- valence of ACE1*D allele in a large cohort of French centenarians compared with younger elderly controls have

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a major constituents of very low density lipoproteins, and a polymorphism in APOE, to an even greater degree than the ACE1 polymorphism, has been extensively examined in populations worldwide for its association with an increased risk for CAD and AD (Davignon et al., 1988; Saunders et al., 1993). Recent findings of a higher prevalence of the APOE 1 2 allele and a lower prevalence of the APOE 1 4 allele in centenarians than in younger controls suggested a role of the APOE polymorphism in longevity (Schachter et al., 1994; Louhija et al., 1994; Panza et al., 1999). We have recently shown that the APOE 1 4 allele frequency decreases according to

2.2. APOE and ACE1 genotyping

in centenarians (Panza et al., 1999). Furthermore, our group has also recently reported the novel finding that the frequency of the ACE1*I allele (and ACE1*I/*I genotype) decreases according to a geographical gradient from Northern to Southern Europe in AD patients and sex and age-matched controls (Panza et al., 2003). Considering previous conflicting findings between ACE1 and longevity and our fortunate access to such a rare cohort of individuals we attempted to examine whether the conflicting findings may be the result of similar regional differences in ACE1 allele frequencies as we have observed with APOE (Panza et al., 1999). The first aim of the present study was to examine the distribution of ACE1 genotype and allele frequencies in a sample of Southern Italian centenarians and middle-aged subjects and test for any evidence of association with longevity. Second, we compared our data with previously reported data from Northern (Danish) and Central (French) European populations, that also tested for association between ACE1 variation and longevity (Bladbjerg et al., 1999; Blanche` et al., 2001). With these data we examined the impact of geographical genetic variation on reported longevity associations.

2.3. Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was performed by the Pearson x2 test to undertake genotype and allele comparisons as well as test for agreement of data with Hardy–Weinberg principles. Allele frequencies were determined by allele counting. To express variances of the allele frequencies, we used 95% confidence intervals, the upper and lower values of which were calculated according to the Wilson’s formulae. A Pearson x2 test was performed to evaluate differences between ACE1 and APOE allele frequencies in centenarians and age-matched controls in Southern Italy. The results of statistical inference were adjusted according to Bonferroni inequality. To evaluate whether the association between ACE1 alleles and longevity were homogeneous in all APOE strata we used a permutation-based exact logistic model by LogXact procedure implemented in the SAS system (Proc-LogXact 5). In these analyses we used the x2 value corresponding to 0.05/3 ¼ 1.7% for each of the individual comparisons, adjusted for Bonferroni inequality. The Cochran–Armitage trend test was carried out to evaluate the geographical gradient among ACE1 allele and genotype frequencies in centenarians and younger controls of three European countries (Italy, France, and Denmark), from published studies (Bladbjerg et al., 1999; Blanche` et al., : : 2001). The threshold of significance was set at p , 0 05 The x2 or z tests were calculated by asymptotic and exact p- values. We reported in most cases the asymptotic p-values except in that situations, essentially due to a small sample size, in which asymptotic and exact p-values give a different conclusion in rejecting the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significant level. In these two last situations we preferred to use exact p-values. The data were analysed by SAS FREQ procedure (version 8.2). Exact tests were evaluated by Proc- StatXact (version 4.0.1).

2.1. Subject selection

studied. These included 82 centenarians and 252 middle- aged, unrelated subjects or volunteers who presented themselves to the Department of Geriatrics, Bari University Hospital, Italy, between March 1995 and December 1998. The population of 82 centenarians was composed of 62 women (75.6%) and 20 men (24.4%) with a mean age of 100 ^ 2 years. Centenarians were recruited from all over the Apulia region (Southern Italy) (regional distribution: 40% Bari region, 18% central, 4% northern, 5% eastern, 15% western, 18% southern), at their home, through the central population register of Apulia. They were all Caucasians residing in Southern Italy. The criteria for inclusion were to be at least 99 years old on the day of blood collection. Furthermore, they had to have no known diagnosis of dementia or other chronic neurological diseases or psychiatric syndromes with cognitive impairment (Solfrizzi et al., 1999), cerebrovascular disease, nephro- pathy or end-stage renal disease, and no severe functional limitations. The group of middle-aged healthy adults ^ included 252 healthy subjects (mean age: 50.5 18.5SD; range: 19–70 years). Finally, these two groups had the same geographical origin and were sex-matched, reflecting the sex differential in longevity in Italy (Capurso et al., 1997). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their relatives; the study project was approved by the Local Ethics Committee.

3. Results

Table 1 shows ACE1 allele and genotype frequencies in centenarians and controls in Southern Italy. The frequencies of the different ACE1 genotypes in our centenarian and control group were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (respectively: x2 ¼ 0: 31; p ¼ 0: 58; x2 ¼ 0: 008; p ¼ 0: 93). No statistically significant differences were found in ACE1 genotype frequencies between centenarians and controls in this Southern Italian population (ACE1*I/*I versus ACE1*I/*D and ACE1*D/*D: Pearson x2 : 0.09

compared to elderly women and controls. In this older population, the ACE1*I/*I genotype was depleted only in elderly males suggesting an influence of sex on the penetrance of ACE1 locus (Galinsky et al., 1997). A subsequent study on Danish centenarians did not confirm the impact of ACE1 gene polymorphism on longevity (Bladbjerg et al., 1999). Finally, retyping the 1994 centenarian cohort of Shachter for the ACE1 polymorph- ism revealed a 5% difference with the original data with the ACE1 allele frequencies. These differences were homo- geneously distributed between gender in both populations of centenarians and controls (Blanche` et al., 2001). The French centenarians and controls of the Shachter cohort were not matched for geographical origin, 20% of the centenarians were born outside of France or had unknown birthplaces, suggesting heterogeneity in the geographical distribution of the ACE1 polymorphism.

in ACE1*D allele frequency was also observed (z ¼ 3: 31; p ¼ 0: 001; z ¼ 3: 62; p ¼ 0: 001; respectively) (Table 1). This was also reflected in the ACE1*D/*D genotype data whereby a similar statistically significant increasing geo- graphical gradient from North to South was found in centenarians and the younger controls (cases: z ¼ 3: 29; p ¼ 0: 001; controls: z ¼ 3: 26; p ¼ 0: 001). An inverse statisti- cally significant gradient was found for the ACE1*I/*I genotype, but only in control subjects (z ¼ 2: 65; p , 0: 01) while in centenarians there was a borderline p-value (z ¼ 1: 93 asymptotic-p ¼ 0: 053; exact-p ¼ 0: 063). We did not find any statistically significant decreasing gradient from Northern to Southern regions for the ACE1*I/*D genotype neither in centenarians nor in controls.

4. Discussion

allele frequency decreases according to a geographical gradient from Northern to Southern Europe in centenar- ians. Conversely, the ACE1*D allele frequency appears to increase in the opposite direction (from South to North). These data confirm previously published results on regional differences of the ACE1*D allele frequency within France (3%) and between Northern Ireland and Southern France (7%) (Cambien et al., 1992) which we also observed in our investigation of the role of geographic gradients on ACE1 involvement in AD (Panza et al., 2003). In the present study there is a statistically significant difference of 15% between the ACE1*D allele frequency between Danish and Southern Italian centenarians and of 9% between France and Italy. In these three geographical sites ACE1 allele frequencies were homogeneously distributed between gender in both populations of centenarians and controls, confirming the recent data of another Italian study with a focus on ACE1 polymorphism and insulin resistance (Paolisso et al.,

The present study did not provide evidence to support the suggested role of the ACE1 polymorphism in increased human longevity due to an increase of ACE1*D allele in centenarians compared to control subjects aged between 20 and 70 years (Schachter et al., 1994). However, a post hoc power calculation revealed that the present study has only sufficient statistical power to exclude an allele frequency difference of about 12% and the power is even less considering the fact that gene–gene interaction were investigated.

be paradoxical, due to the previously reported associations of ACE1*D allele with elevated circulating plasma ACE1 levels and increased risk of myocardial infarction and CAD (Cambien et al., 1992). However, there might, as yet, be some unknown benefit from the inheritance of the ACE1*D allele. For example, the involvement of ACE1 polymorph- ism in a wide range of cellular functions, such as repair to damaged tissues as well as or in addition to reported resistance to neoplasia or infection all of which would favour increased survival rates (Costerousse et al., 1992; Eisenlohr et al., 1992). Furthermore, the unexpected association of ACE1*D/D with longevity (Schachter et al., 1994) might be somehow linked to the recent, suggested relationship between reduced risk of AD development on inheritance of the ACE1*D allele with AD (Kehoe et al., 1999). Two separate studies have attempted but have failed to replicate the original longevity findings (Bladbjerg et al., 1999; Blanche` et al., 2001). An additional case-referent and retrospective cohort study in a Danish population revealed that the relative frequencies of ACE1*D/*D genotype and ACE1*D allele were statistically unaffected by age in both women and men, suggesting that the ACE1 gene polymorphism did not influence longevity (Agerholm-Lar- sen et al., 1997). In a previous study of British subjects aged 84 and older the authors reported a significant difference in ACE1 genotype frequencies in elderly men

edge that the comparison of our allele and genotype frequencies with other published studies has to be considered with some caution since published data will have been generated in different laboratories, with slightly differing methodologies, and thus there is a possibility of discrepancies in genotype classification (Ueda et al.,1996). However, in defence of this, the data presented by Blanche` and colleagues actually involved the re-genotyping of ACE1, in the original 1994 centenarian cohort of Shachter, with a more reliable two-step method (Rigat et al., 1992; Lindpaintner et al., 1995), as used by us and they described only a 5% deviation from the original genotypes that were homogenously distributed across all genotypes (Blanche` et al., 2001). Furthermore, the study on Danish centenarians (Bladbjerg et al., 1999) also utilized a similar method of ACE1 genotyping that included a third internal PCR primer (Evans et al., 1994). Indeed, even with the

While it appears that APOE may play a role in longevity in centenarians in Southern Italy (Panza et al., 1999) and other populations (Schachter et al., 1994; Louhija et al., 1994; Frisoni et al., 2001), the current evidence in conjunction with previous work (Bladbjerg et al., 1999; Blanche` et al., 2001) does not support a similar involvement for the ACE1 gene, nor of an interaction between the alleles of both genes. We must however, also acknowledge that the cross-sectional design and a relatively small number of centenarians of the present study are limited in their statistical power and thus we cannot make definitive conclusions. Only longitudinal studies specifically designed for addressing the impact of the ACE1 polymorphism on extreme longevity could provide more robust evidence. In conclusion, in the present study no association between ACE1 polymorphism and longevity was found for Southern Italy populations, however, it is interesting that there are significant geographical differences in ACE1 allele fre- quencies, decreasing in a gradient-like fashion from North- ern to Southern Europe, that could impact, with other environmental factors (e.g. differing diet, lifestyle), on variation in human longevity.
