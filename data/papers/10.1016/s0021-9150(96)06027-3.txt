Abstract

Genetic factors are likely to affect human survival, since twin studies have shown greater concordance for age of death in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins. Coronary artery disease is an important contributor to premature mortality in the UK. Accordingly, we have chosen genes associated with cardiovascular risk, apo E:apo C-I, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), as candidates which may affect longevity:survival into old age. An association study was performed by comparing allele and genotype frequencies at polymorphic loci associated with these genes in 182 women and 100 men aged 84 years and older with 100 boys and 100 girls younger than 17 years. MTHFR allele and genotype frequencies were similar in the elderly and young populations. Apo C-I allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different in the elderly women compared to the younger sample (PB0.05). No difference was observed in the elderly men. At the neighbouring apo E gene, we only observed a difference between genotypes in the elderly women and the young sample; however, this did not retain significance when the genotype frequencies of the young sample were adjusted to values expected from the allele frequencies on the basis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and compared to observed genotypes in elderly men and women. In contrast to previous studies, apo E2 was not overrepresented in the elderly men or women. Thus, the proposition that apo E2, E3 and E4 protein isoforms are themselves functionally associated with increasing risks for early death, may be too simplistic. The I:I ACE was depleted in the elderly males but not the elderly females. Furthermore, significant differences were observed between ACE genotypes in elderly men and elderly women. These data suggest that the penetrance of loci which influence survival may vary according to sex. The depletion of the ACE I:I genotype in elderly men is generally consistent with a previous study which found decreased frequencies of the I allele in French centenarians compared to younger controls. However, these results are apparently paradoxical, since others have suggested that the I allele is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Clarification of the overall effect of a genotype on survival will be vital if therapies are to be considered which target specific genetic variants. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction

Premature mortality is generally regarded as mortal- ity below the age of 65. The main causes of death in the UK in individuals below this age and for the two

succeeding decades are cardiovascular diseases and can- cers. The greatest recent change in the UK demography has been in the number of people aged 84 and over. It is important to understand the genetic influences on survival in order to predict better the likely configura- tions of health and disability in the future and to prevent chronic disease.

ble for the apo E association with this disease, we were interested in investigating the suggestions of Chartier- Harlin [9] and Templeton [8] that the apo C-I locus, either by itself or in combination with the apo E locus, could provide more information than apo E alone in association studies.

(MTHFR) gene was examined as a candidate in this study, since MTHFR catalyses the reduction of 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methylenetetrahydrofo- late, the principal form of folate present in the circulation, which acts as a carbon donor for remethy- lation of homocysteine to methionine. Autosomal reces- sive MTHFR deficiency is characterised by homocysteinaemia and patients are at increased risk for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis [10]. Recently, Frosst et al. [11] have described a common C to T substitution at nucleotide 677 in this gene which results in the conver- sion of alanine to valine. Homozygotes for this muta- tion, which is associated with thermolability of the enzyme, are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

Genetic factors are likely to affect human survival, since twin studies have shown greater concordance for age of death in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins [1]. Although many of these genetic influences affect specific diseases which are important contributors to premature mortality, like cardiovascular disease, it is possible that the biological effects of genetic variables are not confined simply to single pathological processes. When attempting to look at genes for complex diseases, there is no reason to assume that one gene impacts on only one disease. For instance, apo E allelic variation is associated with coronary artery disease and Alzheimer’s disease risk (reviewed in [2]) and there are suggestions that allelic variants which predispose to certain diseases may be associated with lower risks for other diseases [3].

In this study, we have compared allele and genotype frequencies at polymorphic loci associated with these candidate genes in a group of individuals aged 84 and older from Cambridge, UK. and a regionally-matched young population aged 17 years or less. This strategy is similar to that used by the previous studies which have investigated genes associated with longevity [3–5].

There are very few studies that have investigated genetic factors which affect survival into old age [3–5]. Schachter et al. [3] reported recently that the apo E4 allele and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion allele were under-represented in centenarians. Thus, these alleles were associated with an increased likelihood of death before age 100. A potential weak- ness of this study [3] was that the aged individuals were from all over France and the non-aged controls were non-geographically matched, unrelated French individ- uals from CEPH pedigrees. It is possible that some of the effects that were observed related to differing allele frequencies in different parts of France.

2. Methods

elderly group came from a ten year longitudinal study of cognitive function and ageing [12]. Participants were originally aged 75 and over, identified from population registers for family practitioners in Cambridge City. The participants had taken part in at least 3 further screening interviews since baseline, 2.4 years, 6 years and 10 years. In this ten year follow-up, of the original 1968 individuals, 546 who had taken part in the previ- ous follow-ups were available for interview. Of these 83% (446) agreed to be seen and successful venepunc- ture was carried out on 63% of these—182 females and 100 males. These individuals represent a sample of individuals who were all aged 84 and older at the time of venepuncture, except for 1 man aged 79 (Fig. 1). Ethical permission for genetic analysis of the Cam- bridge City cohort has been obtained from the Adden- brooke’s Hospital Ethics Committee.

The excess of the deletion allele of the ACE Alu insertion:deletion polymorphism in centenarians com- pared to controls in the study of Schachter et al. [3] was apparently paradoxical, since this allele was previously associated with higher circulating plasma ACE levels [6] and with a predisposition to myocardial infarction, hypertension, cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hy- pertrophy [7]. Therefore, we attempted to replicate these findings.

We have also examined polymorphisms associated with the apo E and apo C-I genes, which are separated by less than 10 kb, and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) loci, as candidates for survival past the age of 84. Apo E is a compelling candidate, since the apo E4 allele is associated with increased risk for both Alzheimer’s disease and coronary heart disease [2]. The presence of a HpaI site at an RFLP in the apo C-I gene, which is adjacent to apo E, has been associ- ated with Alzheimer’s disease risk [8]. Although this is probably due to the same functional mutation responsi-

This sample of individuals aged 84 and older was compared to 100 boys and 100 girls under the age of 17 who were randomly chosen from referrals to the East Anglian Regional Genetics Service Molecular Genetics Laboratory in Cambridge. All samples are apparently unrelated. The young sample are likely to be of a

and girls, since no selection for longevity:survival is expected to have occurred. Pre-reproductive selection is likely to lead to the rapid extinction of deleterious alleles, unless it is countered by some type of balancing selection or recurrent mutations. This situation is un- likely to be compatible with the high frequencies of the alleles at the loci we have chosen to examine. Thus, genotypes and allele frequencies from the boys and girls were pooled to give a larger sample size for this group in order to minimise type I errors.

similar ethnic and geographical origin to the older group, since referral patterns to the laboratory suggest that more than 97% of cases are Caucasian, with about 80% of the parents of these children resident in East Anglia and almost all of the remainder from the UK. Allele frequencies at all loci examined below did not deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the young sample—expected genotype frequencies were extrapolated from the observed allele frequencies and compared to the observed genotype frequencies using (cid:120)2 tests. In order to demonstrate that our old and young populations were genetically homogeneous at a locus that we did not expect to be involved in prema- ture mortality, we analysed the SspI RFLP [13] in the % 3 untranslated part of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in 100 old individuals (50 males and 50 females) and 96 young individuals. The allele which was associated with the presence of the restriction site was designated 2. The frequencies of the 1:1, 1:2 and 2:2 genotypes at this locus were as follows—elderly men: 0.18, 0.52, 0.30; elderly women: 0.26, 0.54, 0.20; young population: 0.28, 0.52, 0.20, respectively. No significant differences were observed for these allele or genotype frequencies when the young population was compared to the total elderly population, the old women, or the old men.

3.1. Apo E and apo C-I

The apo E allele distributions of the young popula- tion were not significantly different from either the total elderly population or the elderly men or women (Table 1). Analysis of apo E genotypes was restricted to E3:3, E 3:4 and E2:3, since the other genotypes were too rare to allow expected values of 5 or more in the (cid:120)2 contin- gency tables (Table 1). No significant difference was found when the total elderly sample or the elderly men were compared to the young sample. However, the genotype frequencies of the elderly women were differ- ent to those of the young sample ((cid:120)2(cid:30)7.49, 2 d.f., PB 0.05). Since apo E allele frequencies were no differ- ent in the elderly women compared to the young sam- ple, we also derived genotype frequencies in the young group from their allele frequencies on the basis of expectations according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This procedure was used under the assumption that no selection for apo E had occurred in the young group and that the genotype frequencies derived from the allele frequencies in the young group may be more representative than the observed genotypes, in view of the random variation of six genotypes which would be expected to occur in a sample of 200. These genotype frequencies were not significantly different to the ob- served genotypes in the elderly women.

Genotype

Apo E, apo C-I, ACE and MTHFR genotypes were determined as described by Hixson and Vernier [14], Nillesen et al. [15], Rigat et al. [16] and Frosst et al. [17], respectively. Observed allele and genotype frequen- cies were compared in the different groups using (cid:120)2 tests. Differences in genotype frequencies between groups were also analysed by a likelihood ratio test, in which the genotype frequencies in the young were con- strained to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and com- pared to the observed allele frequencies in the elderly men and women. Relative risks (odds ratios) and confi- dence limits for each of the polymorphisms were calcu- lated using standard methods [18].

Since apo C-I and apo E are less than 10 kb apart, apo C-I genotype and allele frequencies can be used to

  

3. Results

Age and sex distributions of the elderly men and women are shown in Fig. 1. Allele and genotype fre- quencies were determined for polymorphic loci associ- ated with each candidate gene and the following comparisons were made: the entire elderly group versus the entire young group, the elderly men versus the entire young group, the elderly women versus the entire young group and the elderly women versus the elderly men. For these autosomal genes, there is no reason to expect different genotype frequencies in young boys

Since ACE allele frequencies were no different in the elderly men compared to the young sample, we derived genotypes in the young group from the allele frequencies on the basis of expectations ac- cording to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These geno- types were not significantly different to the observed genotypes in the elderly men. However, the role of ACE in survival into old age is supported by finding different observed genotype distributions in elderly men and women, with males having a reduction of I:I. No significant differences in ACE allele or genotype fre- quencies were found in the young boys and girls (boys: DD(cid:30)38%, ID(cid:30)39%, II(cid:30)23%; girls: DD(cid:30)35%, ID(cid:30)42%, II(cid:30)42%).

nonagenarians) [4]. Our sample may have been biased towards healthy survivors, since a proportion of our cohort refused assessment, or were too confused to give consent for DNA analysis. However, those who pro- vided samples are more likely to live longer and there- fore this bias is unlikely to have reduced the power of our analysis of genes associated with longevity. These studies were designed so that the elderly and young populations were carefully regionally matched, in order to avoid regional variations in genotype frequencies. This is important especially when examining loci genes like apo E, where allele frequencies vary greatly in different populations [5]. The similar allele and geno- type frequencies observed at the APC (see Section 2) and MTHFR loci confirm this assumption.

groups. Similar proportions of all populations were homozygous for the mutation.

4. Discussion

Our data support previous observations that apo E:apo C-I and ACE genotype frequencies differ in elderly and young populations, suggesting a role for these genes in human longevity. The effects associated with these genes may be different for males and fe- males, since apo E:apo C-I genotypes were only differ- ent in elderly women, while ACE genotypes were only different in elderly men. Furthermore, ACE genotypes were significantly different in elderly men and elderly women but not in young boys and girls.

Apo E genotypes have been previously examined in centenarians, nonagenarians and octogenarians [3–5]. The female-specific apo E genotype frequency differ- ence in our elderly individuals was initially considered to be equivocal, since this result was not significant when the observed genotypes of the elderly women were compared to those in the young group computed from their allele frequencies, according to expectations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. However, the female

Our study analysed DNA from 282 individuals over 84 and 200 individuals aged younger than 17 years. This sample is not large enough to rule out weak genetic associations, like the putative effect of the 677C-T MTHFR mutation. However, our elderly sam- ple was of a similar size to that of Schachter et al. (325 centenarians) [3] and larger than those of Davignon et al. (236 octogenarians) [5] and Kervinen et al. (95

specific effect of this region of chromosome 19 on longevity was confirmed by examination of an apo C-I polymorphism, which is within 10 kb of apo E. Davi- gnon et al. [5] found a significant decrease in the apo E4 allele frequency in Canadian female octogenarians, which was not found in the males. Although both our study and that of Davignon et al. [5] failed to detect an apo E:apo C-I association in males, this may have been revealed by a larger sample size. However, gender differences in apo E-related risks for late-onset diseases are not particularly surprising. Previous studies have reported a stronger association between apo E4 and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in females [19,20]. For exam- ple, in families with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, fe- male apo E4 heterozygotes have higher risks for AD than those without apo E4, but the risks to het- erozygote women are no greater than those for ho- mozygotes. In men, the apo E4 homozygotes have higher risks than the heterozygotes and non-apo E4 carriers, but there was no significant difference in risks between apo E4 heterozygotes and non-apo E4-carriers [20]. In addition, recent work suggests that apo E has a significant effect on a larger set of lipid:apolipoprotein parameters in females compared to males [21].

remain significant when we re-analysed our data after the observed genotypes of the older men were com- pared to those in the young group computed from their allele frequencies, according to expectations of Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium. However, the importance of the ACE gene in longevity and the possibility of sex-specific effects was supported by our findings of different ACE genotypes in the elderly women and men. Our old individuals were younger than the French centenarians (see Fig. 1). It is possible that the deleterious effects of the I allele manifest at an earlier age in males than in females.

Schachter et al. explained the apparently paradoxical results they observed by suggesting that high blood pressure may be a protective factor in very old age [3]. However, the effects of this locus on longevity may involve non-cardiovascular manifestations, since neu- roendocrine [23] and immunomodulator [24] activities have been proposed for this enzyme. A correlation between ACE activity in cortical tissue and increasing age may suggest an adaptive response to increasing needs during ageing [25].

These studies highlight the importance of investigat- ing genotype variation, in addition to allelic variation, in genetic studies of survival into old age. Genetic influences in the individual are determined by genotypes and it is possible that certain combinations of deleteri- ous and comparatively protective genotypes may result in an effect being masked if only allele frequencies are considered. This may occur if the impact of a het- erozygous genotype is not midway between the two related homozygous states and if the frequency of a risk-related homozygous genotype is comparatively low. Such a scenario may be operating at the ACE locus. If the rare I:I genotype is deleterious and if the I:D and D:D genotypes are associated with similar risks, then it will be difficult to detect a change in the allele frequencies unless a larger sample is studied.

codon interchanges associated with apo E2, E3 and E4 are functionally associated with increasing risks for early death is suggested by earlier findings that the apo E4 allele is under-represented and apo E2 is over-repre- sented in centenarians [3]. Apo E2 is not overrepre- sented in our elderly population. Perhaps this can be explained by the younger age of our sample. Alterna- tively, this finding and the relatively stronger influence of the apo C-I gene would be compatible with at least two other possibilities. First, other DNA variants in this region of chromosome 19 may also be of functional significance. Second, apo E2 may in certain cases be associated with a greater risk than apo E3. For in- stance, apo E2:3 individuals have greater risks of carotid artery atherosclerosis than apo E3:3 ho- mozygotes [22].

There are a number of advantages of studying geno- types associated with longevity alongside disease-spe- cific analyses. First, loci like apo E and maybe ACE may impact on different disease systems. Thus, the quantitative effect of allelic variation on longevity will be difficult to predict from disease-specific studies. Sec- ond, it is possible that a given allele can be beneficial and deleterious at various stages of life, or that rela- tively deleterious and relatively beneficial functional variants are in linkage disequilibrium with alleles at a locus. This is possibly exemplified by the apparently paradoxical decrease in the I:I ACE genotype in elderly men, since studies of this locus in the context of coro- nary risk implicated the D allele as being deleterious. Clarification of the overall effect of a genotype is vital, if therapies are to be considered which interfere with a

ACE has been implicated as a risk factor for coro- nary artery disease in numerous studies. The DD geno- type has been previously considered as the deleterious allele, as it is more prevalent in myocardial infarction survivors and in victims of sudden cardiac death. The study of Schachter et al. [3] revealed an apparently paradoxical result, since the D allele was found in excess in the centenarians. We felt that this interesting result was important to replicate, since the centenarian and control populations were not precisely matched for geographical location and the controls ranged from 20–70 years. Of these centenarians 87% were women [3]. Although our data showed a similar trend, the reduction in the ACE I:I genotype in the elderly indi- viduals was confined to the men. This trend did not
