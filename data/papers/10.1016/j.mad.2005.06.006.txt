Abstract

Negative affect such as depression and anxiety has been reported to be associated with morbidity and mortality, and polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene may be associated with such affect disorders. Hypothesizing that 5HTT gene polymorphisms could influence human longevity via negative affect; we compared the polymorphic variation of the 5HTT gene between 265 Japanese centenarians and control subjects. In addition, we evaluated the relationships between the 5HTT genotype and the physical, cognitive, and biologic status of centenarians, as indicated by the Barthel Index, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and serum albumin concentration, respectively. The frequency of the l/l genotype and the l allele was significantly greater in centenarians than in younger control subjects, particularly women. A significant effect of the 5HTT genotype on serum albumin concentration was observed in both sexes. Although, there was sex optionality, the l allele may carry a longevity advantage possibly through behavioral mechanisms. # 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

between gene polymorphisms and human emotion, affect, or behavior have been reported (Lesch et al., 1996). We describe here an investigation of the contribution of the affect-related serotonin transporter (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HTT) gene-linked polymorphism region (5HTT-LPR) to longevity in a cohort taken from the Japanese population.

Recent progress in genome studies has indicated that gene polymorphisms contribute to human longevity. These polymorphisms are thought to influence longevity through several potential mechanisms including the immune system (Takata et al., 1987; Bonafe et al., 2001) and the metabolic system (Schachter et al., 1994; Geesaman et al., 2003). Although psychobehavioral systems are also important factors in longevity, little is known about them, and little interest has been paid to polymorphisms of candidate genes that might influence human behavior. Recently, relationships

The adverse impact of negative affect on health has been reported in many papers (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2002). Major depression or depressed mood has been associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (Pratt et al., 1996), decreased physical function (Rantanen et al., 2000), and higher cancer risk (Penninx et al., 1998), as well as mortality (Herrmann et al., 1998). Anxiety has been linked to heart disease, including myocardial infarction (Eaker et al., 1992; Kawachi et al., 1994).

Even though the findings regarding the effect of 5HTT gene polymorphism on negative emotion or health in Japanese subjects are equivocal, they do suggest that it would be valuable to explore the influences of 5HTT on human health and mortality. We hypothesized that 5HTT gene polymorphism influences human longevity via a negative impact on the affective state as a result of stressful life experiences. The frequency of the l/l genotype and l allele would therefore be higher among long-lived indivi- duals than in the younger population. We also hypothesized that if a particular gene polymorphism has a positive impact on longevity, the functional status, such as basic activities of daily living (ADL), or cognitive function among people who possess this genotype would be better maintained, even in the final stages of their life. In the study presented here, we compared the distribution of 5HTT polymorphisms in a large number of Japanese centenarians with that in younger control subjects. We also explored the effects of 5HTT polymorphisms on physical, cognitive, and biological function in the centenarians.

The 5HTT-LPR has been linked with negative affect and personality (Lesch et al., 1996). The two most common alleles are a 44-bp insertion (l allele) or deletion (s allele) in its promoter region. The s allele reduces the efficiency of transcription of the gene, resulting in decreased serotonin transporter expression and serotonin uptake by lymphoblasts (Lesch et al., 1996). Possession of the s allele has been associated with higher neuroticism, higher harm avoidance, and depression (Lesch et al., 1996), including geriatric depressive symptoms (Steffens et al., 2002). For healthy adults, the 5HTT showed strongest association to personality trait among personality-associated genes (Munafo et al., 2003).

A recent report has also indicated that gene-environment interactions exist in relation to the 5HTT gene polymorph- ism and an individual’s emotional state. Decreased serotonergic function, which is associated with impulsive- ness, aggressive behavior, and low sociality, is observed in rhesus monkeys with the s allele if they are not reared by their mothers (Bennett et al., 2002). In addition, in humans the susceptibility to becoming depressed after experiencing negative life events is higher in individuals with s alleles than in those with l alleles (Caspi et al., 2003). In women, carriers of the s allele tend to complain of psychological and somatic symptoms if they are not employed or have a chronic disease (Grabe et al., 2004). In a recent functional neuroimaging study it was reported that activation of the right amygdala in response to angry and fearful facial expressions was stronger in subjects with, than in those without the s alleles (Hariri et al., 2002).

2.1. Subjects

2.1.1. Centenarian group

women) living in the 23 wards of metropolitan Tokyo participated in a survey in which they were visited by Tokyo Centenarian Study staff between July 2000 and May 2002. We randomly chose centenarians from the residential list and sent a letter inviting participation to 1194 centenarians, accounting for 66.9% of an estimated 1785 centenarians living in this area in the study period. Five hundred thirteen (43.0%) agreed to participation. Three hundred four represented 25.5% of the letter recipients, participated in the visit survey. Women outnumbered men in our sample by 1:3.5, which was not significantly different from the ratio for the total centenarian population in this area (1:3.9). Among our participants, 206 were living at home and 98 were institutionalized; eight of those living at home were living alone. A medical doctor, a psychologist, and a nurse conducted the survey in a visit to the centenarians’ residences. After a medical checkup and blood sampling, the psychologist conducted cognitive assessment and psychological testing. The ADL were evaluated using the Barthel Index (Collin et al., 1988). Psychologists assessed cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) at the time of the visit. Anxiety-related personality traits were evaluated by NEO- FFI (Costa and McCrae, 1985) Japanese version (Shimonaka et al., 1997) answered by proxy who knows participants well. The Barthel Index and the MMSE are used commonly in centenarian studies to evaluate physical function and cognitive status, respectively. Serum albumin concentration

The frequency of occurrence of the l/l genotype and l allele is far less common in Japanese people than in Caucasians (Nakamura et al., 1997; Arinami et al., 1999; Ishiguro et al., 1999; Ishikawa et al., 1999; Katsuragi et al., 1999; Kumakiri et al., 1999; Murakami et al., 1999; Kunugi et al., 2000; Umekage et al., 2003). The reported effects of 5HTT polymorphism on negative affect have not been consistent. While no relationship has been observed between this polymorphism and either bipolar affective disorder (Kunugi et al., 1997) or anxiety-related personality (Umekage et al., 2003), Murakami et al. (1999) and Katsuragi et al. (1999) reported an association with anxiety-related personality. Another study has also revealed an association with anxiety- related personality trait, but this finding could not be confirmed statistically because of the low number of l/l

Negative influences of the l allele on health in Japanese people have also been reported. Possession of the l allele was correlated with the early onset of alcohol dependence (Ishiguro et al., 1999), habitual smoking (Ishikawa et al., 1999), and coronary heart disease among smokers (Arinami et al., 1999). However, these reports included either only men or only few women as participants. These inconstant results may be attributable not only to ethnic differences, but also to gender differences and to the small sample sizes used in these previous Japanese studies.

was measured as a biologic indicator of health status that has been linked to physical and cognitive function as well as the mortality risk of centenarians (Shimizu et al., 2001). Of the 304 participants, 265 (men 59, women 206) blood samples were suitable for analysis of DNA polymorphism. Table 1 details the characteristics of the centenarians studied.

2.1.2. Younger control subjects

Data for younger controls were derived from two sources. We recruited 225 adults (131 women, 94 men; mean age, 37.9    11.5 years; range 19–67 years). They were recruited from the university students, co-medical personnel, and bank clerk as volunteers. However, the frequency of the l/l genotype among Japanese is low, precluding accurate estimation of genotype distribution based on the small sample size. Therefore, we combined our control 5HTT genotype distribution results with genotype distributions reported in previous studies of Japanese populations (Arinami et al., 1999; Ishiguro et al., 1999; Ishikawa et al., 1999; Katsuragi et al., 1999; Kumakiri et al., 1999; Murakami et al., 1999; Kunugi et al., 2000; Nakamura et al., 1997; Umekage et al., 2003). Participants’ age range of those

studies was 19–77 and they were composed of the volunteers of medical checkup patients, healthy general public and medical staff. The details of those participants were shown in Table 2.

The genotype distribution by gender is shown in Table 2. We compared our results in centenarians with genotype in this combined younger control group. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their families. The ethics committee of Keio University School of Medicine approved this study.

2.2. DNA polymorphism

Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by phenol extraction. Polymorphisms of the 5HTT gene were determined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method, as previously described (Lesch et al., 1996).

Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software version 11.5J (SPSS, Japan). The x2-test was performed to

The frequency of the l allele was significantly higher in centenarians (24.0% versus 19.0%; x2 = 7.1, p < 0.01); this effect was observed only for women (24.0% versus 18.6%; x2 = 5.3, p < 0.05). This null effect in men was not derived from low statistical power to detect a significant difference (a = 0.05, power = 10%, 2-tailed) in this sample.

3. Results

3.2. Association between the 5HTT genotype and physical, cognitive, and biological status

The effects of the 5HTT genotype on NEO-FFI, Barthel Index, MMSE, and serum albumin were analyzed in centenarians (Table 4). No significant effect of genotype was observed for Barthel Index or MMSE and any of NEO- FFI dimensions. A significant main effect of genotype was observed for serum albumin concentration (F = 4.2, p < 0.05). Further, multiple comparison indicated that serum albumin concentrations were higher in association with the l/l genotype than with the s/s genotype ( p < 0.01). Neither a significant gender main effect nor a gender- genotype interaction was observed. We also conducted the same analysis on serum albumin concentration for our

The genotype distributions matched with expecta- tions for a Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, in younger control. The l/l genotype was uncommon in both centenarians (8.3%) and control subjects (3.9%). The distribution of genotypes between centenarians and young control was compared. Statistically significant difference was observed (l/l versus l/s and s/s, x2 = 7.8, p < 0.01). When an analysis was performed according to gender, a significant distribution difference was

that this gender difference could be explained by the biological and lifestyle differences between men and women. Several studies have suggested the existence of gender-genotype interactions in the effects of the seroto- nergic system. Whole blood serotonin level is higher in men (Weiss et al., 2005). The rate of serotonin synthesis in the central spinal fluid is lower in women than in men (Nishizawa et al., 1997), and it has been reported that the effect of the 5HTT genotype on serotonin turnover differs between the genders (Williams et al., 2003). The effect of treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor on emotional disorders is greater in women throughout the life cycle (Yonkers, 2003). A higher frequency of suicide attempts was reported only in women with the s/s genotype (Baca-Garcia et al., 2002). The higher ratio of the l/l genotype in women, theoretically results in increased sensitivity of their serotoninergic system.

4. Discussion

The influence of 5HTT polymorphism on longevity in the Japanese population was investigated. We hypothesized that 5HTT polymorphism could mediate the human affective state, which influences health and longevity. First, we found a significant difference in genotype distribution and allele frequency for5HTT polymorphism betweencentenarians and younger control subjects, particularly women. Second, we found a statistically significant but weak association between the 5HTT genotype and serum albumin concentration, which is a biological marker of health status among centenarians.

There is much psychological stress in human life. Centenarians living in Tokyo have experienced catastrophic life events including a catastrophic earthquake, two world wars, and personal life events such as bereavement resulting from the deaths of spouses and children. The negative impact of these life events on the affective state is thought to be greater in individuals with the s allele (Caspi et al., 2003; Grabe etal., 2004).Wefoundthatthedistributionofboththel/ l genotype and the l allele, which is a protective factor against stressful experiences, was higher in centenarians than in young control subjects. Even though we could not examine the actual responses to the stressful situations of centenarians during their long lives, this finding suggests that this affect- related gene polymorphism may have a positive impact upon human longevity. The mechanism is unknown but perhaps acts through immune (Takata et al., 1987; Bonafe et al., 2001) or metabolic pathways (Schachter et al., 1994; Geesaman et al., 2003) that are also linked to longevity.

Lifestyle differences may also influence gender differ- ences in genotype distribution. Several papers have reported adverse effects of the l allele on longevity. Relationships have been found in Japanese men between possession of the l allele and a smoking habit (Ishikawa et al., 1999), earlier onset of alcoholism (Ishiguro et al., 1999), and a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease among smokers (Arinami et al., 1999). Both alcohol drinking and smoking habits are more prevalent in men than in women in the Japanese population. The positive effect on survival of possessing the l allele might thus be obscured in men because of a lifestyle-genotype interaction.

A gender difference in the gene effect has been reported in several centenarian studies. Among Italian centenarians, an interferon-g allele polymorphism difference was observed only in women (Lio et al., 2002a), while a (cid:2)1082G homozygosity difference was observed only in men (Lio et al., 2002b). The G allele at the (cid:2)174C/G locus, which influences plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentration, was decreased only in male centenarians (Bonafe et al., 2001). These authors explained the gender difference in terms of hormonal regulation. With regard to the gender difference in the effect of 5HTT polymorphism, it was considered that this might be influenced by the difference of lifestyle and/or hormonal status, between men and women.

However, no association was found between the 5HTT genotype and anxiety-related personality traits among the centenarians. Our previous report indicated that centenar- ians are more neurotic than young controls (Masui et al., 2002). This higher degree of neuroticism contributes to increased health-seeking behavior, such as frequently consulting a doctor (Jerram and Coleman, 1999), which is assumed to be a helpful coping mechanism for survival. Such a confounding factor might influence the null effect of 5HTT polymorphism on the behavioral aspect of centenar- ians. In addition, a recent functional neuroimaging study has shown that activation of the right amygdala, which processes angry and fearful facial expressions, was stronger in the s-allele-positive group than in the s-allele-negative group, even though there was no difference in anxiety-related personality traits between these groups (Hariri et al., 2002). According to this finding, we might hypothesize that even if we could find no difference in personality phenotype among the different genotypes, the biological response, is functioning and may contribute to survival.

We were able to analyze the data from 25.2% of all recruited centenarians. This might have resulted in a selection bias such that those centenarians with low anxiety levels who possess the l allele and high ADL healthier centenarians tended to participate in this study. With regard to the anxiety level, because of the prevalence of dementia among our sample of centenarians (65% of all participants), in the majority of cases agreement to participate was obtained from a family member or by proxy, rather than from the centenarians themselves. Thus, it is unlikely that the anxiety level of the centenarians influenced the decision to participate. We also compared the NEO-FFI score between those mail-survey participants (n = 209) who did not agree to be visited by our research members and those

who did; no significant difference between the two groups was observed for any of the personality dimensions. Thus, we believe that the gene-related anxiety level did not influence participation in the study.

On the other hand, though the ADL level of whole participants of our study was deteriorated, Barthel Index score in visit survey participants (mean = 44.1, S.D. = 34.8) were significantly higher ( p < 0.01) than in mail-survey participants (mean = 34.4, S.D. = 32.7). This implies that the healthier centenarians were likely to participate in our study. To avoid the sampling bias, non-invasive sampling method (e.g. postal buccal washes) will be need in future study. However, in terms of exploring the long live and healthy aging gene polymorphisms, the purpose of our study, observed result here could be situated as to find a clue of contribution of affect-associated gene to the longevity.

Acknowledgments

We greatly appreciate the time and assistance provided by the centenarians and their family members. We could not have carried out this study without their kind cooperation.

This study was partly supported by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare for the Scientific Research Project on Longevity, a grant for studying the sociomedical background of centenarians (Principal Inves- tigator, Nobuyoshi Hirose), a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (No. 15730346, Yasuyuki Gondo), and aid for research from the Keio Health Consulting Center.

In terms of sampling bias, we also have to mention the young control data. Because of the low frequency of l/l genotype, and not population based standardized value, we used pooled values as control. This method has advantage to stabilized the scattered genotype distribution among small sample studies. However, we could not avoid the publication bias, that not all conducted data were published and difficult to control the participants back ground. Standardized distribution of 5HTT polymorphism in various age groups with representative sample must be compared to conform and replicate this finding.

We hypothesized that 5HTT gene polymorphism would influence not only longevity, but also functional status among centenarians. As expected, we found that l/l individuals exhibited a significant but slightly higher serum albumin concentration, which is a strong marker of physical function, cognitive function, and mortality in centenarians (Shimizu et al., 2001), than s/s individuals. The biological mechanism linking the gene polymorphism and serum albumin level has not yet been characterized.

population, and the l/l genotype is relatively rare (about 5%, from our review of the literature). It is paradoxical that the frequency of the l/l genotype, which may contribute to longevity, is lower among ethnic groups with the longest average lifespan. However, serotonergic function may vary with both ethnicity and gender (Kunugi et al., 1997; Gelernter et al., 1998). The lifetime morbidity rate for affective disorders is lower in Asian populations than among Caucasians (Weissman et al., 1996). Some of this difference may be artifact due to differences in the way different cultures measure affective disorders. For example, despite a lower prevalence of affective disorders in Asia suicide among the elderly is markedly higher than in the U.S. and many Western countries (Rockett and Smith, 1989). Nevertheless, a positive effect of the l allele upon longevity or biological functions might not apply equally to all ethnic groups. In addition, we did not confirm any association between age and serum albumin concentration by multi- cohort or longitudinal study. Further study is required to
