Abstract

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of developing a wide variety of disorders from diabetes to neurodegenerative diseases suggesting functions not confined to its vascular effects originally described. Based on the VEGF protective roles undisclosed in pathological conditions, we evaluate whether VEGF variability might be a determinant also for longevity. Four polymorphisms (−2578C/A, −1190G/A, −1154G/A and −634G/C) within the VEGF gene promoter region in 490 unrelated Italian healthy subjects have been analysed. Significant changes of allele, genotype (−2578/AA versus −2578/CC: OR=2.08, p=0.007; −1190/AA versus −1190/GG: OR=2.01, p=0.011) and haplotype (AAGG: 10.4% versus 14.9%, p=0.03) frequency distributions were observed between young/elderly (25–84 years old) and long-lived (85–99 years old) subjects. These results suggest that VEGF gene variability can be inserted among the genetic factors influencing the lifespan.

1. Introduction

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an impor- tant angiogenesis cytokine that undergoes transcriptional and post-transcriptional induction by hypoxia. It has been implicated in several pathological conditions, from tumour proliferation to inflammatory and ischemic processes (Carmeliet, 2003; Ferrara et al., 2003). VEGF has been originally identified on the basis of its vascular effects, but recently has been recognised as an important sig- nalling molecule in the nervous system, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders and in peripheral neuropathies (Rosenstein and Krum, 2004; Storkebaum and Carmeliet, 2004). An age-dependent decline in VEGF expression has been reported in different tissues, however the molecu- lar alterations responsible for this reduction have not been

Longevity represents a very complex phenomenon due to the interaction among genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Identification of genetic and non-genetic factors involved in aging has progressed extensively in the recent years because of increased interest in defining the deter- minants of human life expectancy. It has been suggested that genes and biochemical factors likely to be impli- cated in aging-related disorders may have an important role also in human longevity. Among genetic markers, sev- eral variants in pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and in vascular factors have been shown to affect successful

elucidated. A number of polymorphisms localised within the VEGF gene promoter region have been linked to increased susceptibility to multiple angiogenesis-dependent diseases and age-related neurological disorders in humans (Del Bo et al., 2005; Lambrechts et al., 2003). Individu- − als homozygous for the haplotypes involving the 2578AA, − − 1154A/G and 634GG variants had lower serum VEGF levels and increased risk of developing amyotrophic lateral − − − sclerosis (ALS). C( 2578)A, C( 1198)T, G( 1190)A and − G( 1154)A polymorphisms have been correlated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition, the same polymorphisms are able to alter basal and post- stimulation promoter activity in human transfected MCF7 cells (Stevens et al., 2003). Finally, an association has − − been reported between 1154 and 2578 genotypes and VEGF production in the peripheral blood mononucleated cells of healthy subjects (Shahbazi et al., 2002). All these effects are dependent on several sequence polymorphisms, suggesting that VEGF gene variability may contribute to the inherited predisposition to VEGF-mediated pathological conditions.

Total DNA was isolated from peripheral blood accord- ing to standard protocols. Three genomic DNA regions containing portions of the VEGF promoter were amplified by PCR (for primer sequences, see Supplementary data). ◦ Amplification protocol was the following: 5 min at 94 C ◦ for the first cycle, denaturation at 94 C for 30 s, anneal- ◦ ◦ ing at 55–60 C for 30 s, extension at 72 C for 40 s for ◦ the subsequent 35 cycles, and a final extension at 72 C − for 5 min. To detect the polymorphism C( 2578)A, frag- ments were directly electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel because of an 18-nucleotide insertion always associated with − the 2578A allele, whereas CC homozygotes do not contain − this insertion. The polymorphism G( 634)C was detected − through PCR followed by MwoI digestion. 1190G/A and − 1154G/A variants were detected through direct sequenc- ing analysis of PCR fragments using BigDyeTerminator TM protocol on an automated 3100ABI Prism Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA).

All subjects were genotyped for the APOE status, as described (Del Bo et al., 1997).

Aim of the present study is to explore the VEGF gene promoter variability as a genetic determinant for longevity in an Italian population.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Two-tailed Pearson’s Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare genotype and allele frequency distri- butions and corresponding odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con- fidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. For haplotype definition, we used the algorithm developed by the haploview program (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview), which uses a two-marker expectation-maximization (EM) to define the eventual blocks, to estimate the maximum-likelihood val- sachay ues and to calculate the D values (Barrett et al., 2005). Haplotype phase and population frequency were inferred using a standard EM algorithm with a partition-ligation approach for blocks with greater than 10 markers. We also adjusted for multiple testing through a permutation approach on single marker. For each permutation, status was shuf- fled among both young/elderly and long-lived individuals, while the genetic data for each subject was not altered. The permutations were repeated 10,000 times.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Subjects

A total of 490 unrelated Italian individuals (40.2% males) born and resident in Northern Italy, ranging from 25 to 99 years of age, were enrolled for this study. Clinical records were obtained for each participant. The presence of moderate/severe dementia in subjects aged more than 80 years was excluded by the mini-mental scale exami- nation (MMSE) test at time of blood collection. Subjects ≤ having a MMSE score 22 points were not included. Two groups of subjects were included in the study. Three hun- dred and four individuals (ranging from 25 to 99 years of age) were volunteers recruited either at nursing homes or at the Alzheimer Unit of “IRCCS Foundation Ospedale Mag- giore Policlinico, Mangiagalli and Regina Elena”, Milan, (non-consanguineous patients’ kindreds); 105 out of 304 subjects were aged more than 65 years; all of them had a MMSE > 26, CDR = 0 and Hachinski Ischemic score < 4 at time of sampling. In addition, 186 subjects (ranging from 80 to 99 years of age) were participants in the ongo- ing Monzino 80-plus study, a prospective door to door population-based survey among all 80 years or older resi- dents in the lower Olona Valley, some 20 km to the north of Milan (Tettamanti et al., 2006). An informed con- sent, approved by the Institutional Review Board of the “IRCCS Foundation Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Man- giagalli and Regina Elena”, Milan, was obtained by all participants.

3. Results

We screened 490 unrelated subjects from Italy for four well-known polymorphisms localised in the promoter and Ww&5/ 5 UTR region of VEGF gene. To carry out a compara- tive analysis of the genotypes, the whole cohort was divided into three age groups: (i) 166 young subjects (ranging from ± 25 to 65 years of age; mean standard deviation (S.D.): ± 47.4 11.2 years; 45.5% males); (ii) 158 elderly subjects ± ± (ranging from 66 to 84 years of age, mean S.D.: 75.7 5.7 years; MMSE: available only in 35 subjects aged more than ± 80years:25.6 1.8points;50.4%males);(iii)166long-lived

± subjects (ranging from 85 to 99 years of age, mean S.D.: ± ± 89.8 2.8 years; MMSE: 25.3 2.5 points; 27.3% males). As expected, the percentage of subjects carrying at least one vasde4 APO 4 allele was significantly reduced in long-lived sub- jects compared to younger individuals (8.1% versus 4.2%, p = 0.03).

All VEGF polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equi- librium (HWE) for the entire cohort of subjects; interestingly, a statistically significant difference was observed between − − 2578 and 1190 HWE frequencies in young/elderly sub- − jects compared to long-lived subjects ( 2578: p = 0.03; − 1190: p = 0.043).

Concerning the haplotype analysis, the four SNPs showed − − a linkage disequilibrium for each pair of loci ( 2578/ 634 pany D value: 0.86). Inferred haplotype frequencies are shown in Table 2; interestingly, haplotype AAGG was signifi- cantly increased in long-lived subjects (p = 0.03) compared to younger individuals. As shown in Table 2, other esti- mated haplotypes (i.e. CGGC, AAAG, AAAC, AGGG) were differently distributed among young/elderly and long-lived subjects in terms of allele frequencies, but they fall to reach a statistically significant difference.

Genotype analysis failed to find different distributions − − − − of C( 2578)A, G( 1190)A, G( 1154)A and G( 634)C polymorphisms in young subjects compared to moderate elderly individuals (Table 1). In contrast, we observed significant differences in terms of genotype and allelic dis- tribution between the group of individuals aged more than 85 years and the two above mentioned groups. Specifically, − − 2578AA and 1190AA genotypes were differently dis- tributed between the groups. Subjects carrying the “at-risk” genotypes had ORs increased up to two-fold (Table 1). We observed some differences between young/elderly and long- lived individuals when subjects were stratified according to − the gender (Supplementary data); in particular, 2578AA, − − 1190AA genotypes and 1190A allele were significantly over-represented in women and not in men.

Furthermore, through the permutation approach on sin- gle markers, we confirmed the previously reported results with the univariate approach (− 2578C/A, χ2, p = 0.02; − 1190G/A, χ2, p = 0.04).

have seen the identification of several candidate genes for longevity, only the role of APOE has so far been consis- tently confirmed (Christensen et al., 2006). The results of the present study, for the first time, support a role for specific VEGF polymorphisms and haplotypes as an advantage for lifespan extension, at least in the cohort of Italian individuals analysed.

tant factor leading to different results in case–control studies. Genetic heterogeneity might explain the different impact of the VEGF variants on the disease’s risks: for instance, we − − recently observed that C( 2578)A and G( 1190)A poly- morphisms are associated with type 1 diabetes in Italy, while − − in Finnish individuals G( 1190) and G( 1154)A variants protect from type 1 diabetes and delay its onset (Del Bo et al., 2006a). However, in order to explain why different com- binations of VEGF genotypes significantly associate to type 1 diabetes in different countries, it has been suggested a pos- sible linkage between VEGF and other genes, such as MHC genes.

a plausible candidate gene for longevity; in fact, VEGF has been implicated in neuronal survival, regeneration, growth, endothelial cell proliferation, migration and vasopermeabil- ity in many types of tissues (Sun et al., 2003). Its expression regulation is very complex being controlled by different factors including estrogens, growth factors and cytokines, many of which have been reported to be associated with longevity. It is known that VEGF is a major regulator of angiogenesis, and both angiogenesis and neurogenesis are regulated by systemic coordinations. When dysregulated, the formation of new blood vessels contributes to numerous malignant, ischemic, inflammatory, infectious and immune disorders (Carmeliet, 2003). The neuroprotective VEGF- mediatedeffectshavebeenassociatedwithregardtoischemic insults, AD, ALS, as well as some effects associated to neurogenesis (Jin et al., 2000). The main neuroprotective mechanisms include the inhibition of potassium channel activity and caspase-3 activity, the enhancement of striatal neurogenesis and maturation of newborn neurons, as detected in adult rat brains after stroke (Sun and Guo, 2005). Abnor- mal regulation of VEGF expression has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and the presence of regulatory mechanisms compensating for an insufficient VEGF activity has been suggested.

− The over-representation of the 2578A allele in the long-lived individuals is an apparent paradox because we previously demonstrated that Italian patients affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) bear the A allele more frequently (Del Bo et al., 2005). It might be explained by the possi- bility that there is an advantage from the inheritance of the − 2578A allele that might be linked to the involvement of this polymorphism, alone or in combination with other VEGF variants, in a wide range of cellular functions which would favour increased survival rates; similarly, the angiotensin I converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) D allele has been shown to be increased both in centenarians and in patients affected by coronary artery disease (Schachter et al., 1994), although the latter association was not confirmed in a larger study with about 5000 cases and 6000 controls (Keavney et al., 2000).

Interestingly, after stratification of the sample accord- − − ing to gender, we observed that 2578AA and 1190AA − genotypes, as well as 1190A allele show a significant over-representation only among long-lived women. The low number of long-lived men enrolled (n = 45), together with the wide differences in sex ratios between young/elderly and long-lived groups (0.92 versus 0.37 ratio men/women, respectively) might explain these discrepancies; accordingly, Fernandez-Santiago et al. (2006) observed a possible gender- dependent association of VEGF gene variability and ALS; the some authors concluded that the probability to detected an association between VEGF and neurodegenerative disease risk may be greater in populations with higher female/male ratios.

VEGF gene is highly polymorphic, with at least 25 dif- ferent polymorphisms, which are organised into haplotypes, with several common different haplotypes identified in the promoter region alone (Rogers and D’Amato, 2006). Pro- moter variations in the VEGF gene are of particular interest. The association of various diseases with VEGF variability has been reported in over 40 different studies with some- what contradictory results (Del Bo et al., 2006b). The marked variability in the genetic background represents an impor-

Disclosure statement

Recently, the interaction among three VEGF variants − (including 1154G/A polymorphism) has been associated to vascular dementia in Koreans (Kim et al., 2006). It is − − plausible that ( 2578AA) and ( 1190AA) make to live longer and consequently the risk of dementia is increased. − We observed that 2578AA variant, as well as other VEGF genotypes, were differently distributed in long-lived subjects ≤ with a MMSE score 26 compared to long-lived subjects having a MMSE score > 26, even if the differences failed to − reachsignificantresults;onthecontrary,twoalleles( 1190A − and 1154A) show a statistically significant distribution within the two subgroups of long-lived subjects. Neverthe- less, a form of selection pressure might be hypothesized, as suggested by the different distribution of HWE frequen- cies observed among young/elderly subjects and long-lived subjects.

There are no actual or potential conflicts of interest.

Dementia, for itself, does not drastically curtail an indi- vidual’s life expectancy; the association between cognitive decline and VEGF variability represents so far an impor- tant item of investigation. Recently, it has been reported − that ( 2578AA) genotype was over-represented among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with a control population (Chiappelli et al., 2006). Further- −  more, ( 2578A) allele was higher in APOE 4-positive MCI patients who developed AD than in those who did not. All these findings support the role of VEGF in the deterioration rate of cognitive performances in both preclinical and clinical AD. Due to the low number of long-lived subjects carrying BE4 at least one APOE 4 allele (n = 14), in the present study, we are unable to analyse the interaction between VEGF and APOE genotypes. Longitudinal studies will be required to verify how many subjects included in the present study, will develop cognitive deficits, as well as, MCI or AD. In addition, VEGF variability in subjects with moderate/severe dementia ≤ (having a MMSE score 22) should be investigated.

Considering the complexity of the mechanisms lead- ing to transcriptional and translational regulation of VEGF expression, additional polymorphisms (also located within the VEGF coding region) may be responsible for the pos- itive association with long term aging. Furthermore, this study opens the question about the role of other angiogenic factors striking similarity to VEGF on successful aging; in fact, angiogenin and progranulin have been recently associ- ated to neurodegenerative disorders and represent molecules with important neuroprotective activities (Baker et al., 2006;

In conclusion, further investigations on the relationship between VEGF gene and successful aging are needed to pro- vide new insight into the possible role of this protein in the longevity. Due to the relatively small sample sizes analysed and to the well known country-associated VEGF variabil- ity, this study might be considered as preliminary and needs further confirmation in larger studies from populations with different genetic background. Nevertheless, our finding adds a new factor to the multifactorial genetic contribution of longevity.
