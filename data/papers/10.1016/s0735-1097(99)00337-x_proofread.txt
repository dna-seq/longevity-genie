Eline Slagboom, PD* from Leiden, The Netherlands studied the contribution of putative risk genotypes at the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE D/D) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 4G/4G) loci to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a population-based cohort.

BACKGROUND 

The ACE D/D and PAI-1 4G/4G genotypes have consistently been associated with elevated plasma activities of the gene products. Although their role in cardiovascular disease has been explored intensively, it is still equivocal.

METHODS 

The ACE and PAI-1 genotypes were determined in 648 subjects aged 85 years old. In a cross-sectional analysis, the genotype distributions in a subset of 356 elderly subjects who were born in Leiden, The Netherlands were compared with those in 250 young subjects whose families originated from the same geographic region. In addition, the complete cohort of elderly subjects was followed over 10 years for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and was stratified according to genotype.

RESULTS 

In the cross-sectional analysis, the ACE and PAI-1 genotype distributions were similar in elderly and young subjects. In the prospective follow-up study, however, the age-adjusted risk of fatal ischemic heart disease was increased threefold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 7.6) in elderly men carrying the PAI-1 4G/4G genotype. The risk of all-cause mortality was not increased among elderly subjects carrying the PAI-1 4G/4G (relative risk [RR] 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.1) or the ACE D/D genotype (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.1). Nor did we observe elevated risks of death from all cardiovascular diseases combined. There was no interaction between the genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS 

The PAI-1 4G/4G genotype may be a risk factor for fatal ischemic heart disease in elderly men. The impact of moderately increased ACE and PAI-1 activities associated with the ACE D/D and PAI-1 4G/4G genotypes is too small to affect mortality in the general population.

Over the last years, a number of common gene variants have been identified that are associated with plasma levels of the gene products and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Most studies performed thus far have not addressed the association of these variants with fatal cardiovascular disease or have only included a small number of fatal cases. Also, very few studies have yet explored how combinations of possible risk genotypes affect disease risk. Establishing such genetic risk profiles is only feasible when relatively large populations are available, and the putative risk alleles have a high frequency in the general population.

Two highly frequent genetic variants that may be linked to cardiovascular disease risk have been identified in the genes encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor and promotes vascular smooth muscle cell growth, and degrades bradykinin, which is a vasodilator. The ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism arises from the presence or absence of an alu repeat located in intron 16 of the ACE gene (frequency of ACE D-allele in whites 0.54) (1). The ACE D-allele is associated with increased ACE activity in plasma (1,2) and tissue (3). Several studies have reported an increased frequency of the ACE D/D genotype in survivors of myocardial infarction as compared with healthy subjects (4-7). However, these results have been challenged by the negative findings from other studies (8-15). In addition to the ongoing debate on the deleteriousness of the ACE D/D genotype, a beneficial influence on survival in very old age was suggested by the increased frequency of the ACE D/D genotype in French centenarians (16).

METHODS 

Subjects. The Leiden 85-plus study is a population-based study in which all inhabitants of Leiden, The Netherlands aged 85 years were invited to take part (30). Of a total ofIn a study conducted from December 1, 1986 to March 1, 1988, there were 1,258 eligible subjects, out of which 221 had died before enrollment. Of the remaining 1,037 subjects, 977 (94%) participated and were medically interviewed at home. Diabetes was diagnosed based on previous history or a glucose level of 11.0 mmol/liter in a nonfasting blood sample or the use of medication for diabetes treatment. After excluding 55 subjects with a non-Dutch (n=29) or unknown (n=69) birthplace, cell material was available from 666 (188 men and 478 women) subjects for the genetic study. DNA was extracted using protein precipitation with potassium acetate and chloroform. The ACE genotypes were determined as previously described (32), with confirmation of the presence of the ACE D/D genotype using an insertion-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (33). The PAI-1 4G/5G genotypes were determined using an allele-specific PCR amplification described by Falk et al. (34). It was not possible to determine the ACE genotype in 26 cases and the PAI-1 genotype in 22 cases for technical reasons. The ACE and PAI genotypes were independently assessed by two observers. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Leiden University, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.

The primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis is PAI-1, and a 4/5-guanine-tract (4G/5G) polymorphism was identified in the promoter of the PAI-1 gene, located 675 base pairs upstream from the start of transcription (17). The PAI-1 4G allele is associated with elevated PAI-1 levels in plasma (frequency of PAI-1 4G-allele in whites 0.52) (17-19), particularly among subjects with relatively high plasma levels of triglycerides, insulin, or glucose (20,21). In vitro studies indicate that the 4G-allele is unable to bind a repressor and is associated with increased transcription of the PAI-1 gene (17,18). Additionally, a very low-density lipoprotein responsive element was found to partly overlap the guanine tract, which may explain the modification effect by triglycerides (22). The elevated plasma PAI-1 level in 4G/4G homozygotes may result in an increased risk of coronary heart disease due to a diminished fibrinolytic capacity. However, studies investigating this hypothesis have produced conflicting results (18,19,23-26).

If a deleterious effect of the ACE D-allele and the PAI-1 4G-allele is present, carriers of both risk alleles may be especially susceptible to disease due to the link between the renin-angiotensin system and fibrinolytic function. Infusion of angiotensin II increases plasma PAI-1 activity in humans (27), and two recent studies showed that the ACE D/D genotype was associated with elevated PAI-1 levels in plasma (28,29). Hence, the ACE and PAI-1 polymorphisms may be involved in cardiovascular disease in part by the same etiologic pathway.

In a cross-sectional analysis, the ACE and PAI-1 genotype distributions were compared between elderly subjects aged 85 years or older and young control subjects. To avoid false associations with the ACE and PAI-1 polymorphisms due to differences in geographic origin rather than age, only those aged 85 years or older who were born in Leiden (n=356, 55%) were compared with a control population consisting of 250 (139 men and 111 women) blood donors aged 18 to 40 years old of Dutch descent with either two Leiden-born parents or one Leiden-born parent and the other born within a 12-km distance from Leiden. Information regarding the birthplace of their grandparents was obtained from a written questionnaire.

The aim of the study was to assess whether the ACE and PAI-1 polymorphisms, either separately or in combination, are associated with mortality in the general population. This was done using two designs within a population-based study among subjects aged 85 years or older in Leiden between 1887 and 1901. Therefore, an investigation was made to determine if the young control population was likely to represent the Leiden genotype distribution of two generations before. The frequencies of the ACE D/D genotype were 27.1%, 27.0%, 27.5%, and 22.4% among young subjects with one or more (n=203), two or more (n=178), three or more (n=120), and four (n=76) Leiden-born grandparents, respectively.

The results of our study do not support an association between the ACE D/D genotype and (cardiovascular) mortality in elderly subjects, nor do they support an interaction between the ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms with respect to mortality risks in elderly subjects. However, our results suggest that the PAI-1 4G/4G genotype may be associated with an increased risk of fatal ischemic heart disease in men, assuming a recessive effect. This finding needs to be confirmed in other studies, preferably with a larger number of events and subjects, and with information on potential confounding factors such as smoking, blood pressure and plasma lipid levels.

In conclusion, our study suggests that the ACE D/D genotype is not associated with increased mortality risks in elderly subjects, nor is there an interaction between the ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms in this respect. The PAI-1 4G/4G genotype may be associated with an increased risk of fatal ischemic heart disease in men, but this finding needs to be confirmed in other studies.Mortality Risks According to Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 Genotype in Subjects 85 Years Old: Cardiovascular Disease, Ischemic Heart Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease, and All-Cause Disease.

ACE and PAI-1 Gene Variants and Mortality.

Studies have reported conflicting results regarding the association of ACE and PAI-1 gene variants with myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease.

While some studies have reported an association of the ACE D/D genotype with a history of myocardial infarction, most larger studies have found no evidence for an association with myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease.

Our observation that the ACE D/D genotype was not associated with mortality or fatal cardiovascular disease in old age indicates that the overall effect of the ACE polymorphisms on fatal disease is probably limited.

The current study could not provide an explanation for the gender-specificity of the association with fatal ischemic heart disease. One previous study also reported data on both genders separately, and these showed that the PAI-1 4G/4G genotype was a risk factor for myocardial infarction in men only.

Interaction.

Recent studies showed that the PAI-1 4G/4G as well as the ACE D/D genotype is associated with increased PAI-1 levels. Although the possible deleterious effect on mortality of a decreased fibrinolytic capacity might have been more readily observed in subjects carrying both risk genotypes, none of our analyses indicated an increased mortality in this subgroup.

PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism.

We found that men 85 years old carrying the PAI-1 4G/4G genotype were at a threefold increased risk of death due to ischemic heart disease during a 10-year follow-up period. This was not reflected in the risk of death from all cardiovascular causes combined or increased mortality before the age of 85 years. The indication that the PAI-1 polymorphism may contribute to the development ofThis text appears to be a list of references for various studies related to genetic factors and their association with myocardial infarction.
