The knowledge of dyslipidemiaand its genetic contributorsinoldest-old subjects islimited; inaddition, the ma- jority of oldest-old subjects are females. Evidence has accumulated that multiple genetic factors play important roles in determining susceptibility to dyslipidemia and extended life span. Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are two plausible candidate genes for human longevity owing to their func- tionally related modulation of circulating lipid homeostasis; however, few studies have considered their inter- play. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of CETP*V (rs5882) and APOE*4 (rs429358 and rs7412) in 372 oldest-old Chinese women (aged 80–109) and 340 controls (aged 20–58). In addition to replicating the associa- tion oflongevity,our maingoal wasto evaluatethe contribution of CETP*V,APOE*4andCETP*APOEinteraction to theriskofdyslipidemia.OnlyAPOE*4conferredariskagainstlongevityandwasassociatedwithhigh-cholesterol (hTC) and mixed dyslipidemia for oldest-old females. Moreover, CETP*V was found to be associated with hypertriglyceridemia (hTG) independently from APOE*4, age, BMI, alcohol drinking, TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c. The stratification test, multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, and nonparametric MDR analysis all suggested a significant CETP*APOE interaction associated with hTG. The unadjusted odds for hTG were more than 4-fold in subjects with CETP*V and APOE*4 than those without either (OR = 4.36, P b 0.001). These results provide evi- dence of strong independent associations between hTG and CETP*V in oldest-old Chinese females, and APOE*4, as an independently non-significant variant, might interact with CETP*V resulting in an increased risk for hTG. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction

duetocomplexphysiologicalandsocialdiscrepancies betweengenders. Also, female oldest-old individuals outnumber males according to most demographic surveys, and these individuals are accompanied by better physical state and thus could survive from severe CAD. Many studies show that female oldest-old subjects remain free from diseases and dis- abilities until quite late in life. A better understandingof dyslipidemia in this population is thus of increasing global importance. Together these observations suggest the importanceof researchconcerningthe genetic risk factors for dyslipidemia, particularly for the female oldest-old population.

Dyslipidemia is characterized by elevation of serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), or both, or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. It is one of the most common causes of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD).Hypertriglyceridemia (hTG), a path- ological condition in whichTG levels areelevated,is an essentialform of dyslipidemia as a risk factor for CAD (Brunzell, 2007), particularly in the setting of low HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) levels and/or elevated LDL cho- lesterol (LDL-c) levels. The identification of risk factors of dyslipidemia would contribute to the prediction of CAD. Despite the rapid growth of the elderly population worldwide, most studies have only focused on middle-aged subjects.

Cholesterol metabolism is different in the oldest populations com- pared to younger subjects (Schatz et al., 2001). Cholesterol ester trans- fer protein (CETP) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are two plausible candidate genes for human longevity due to their functionally related modulation of maintenance of circulating lipid homeostasis. CETP pro- motes the transfer of excess cholesterol ester (CE) from vessel wall to the liver through the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway (Lamarche et al., 1999). In this process, CETP increases the CE trans- ferred from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins in exchange for TG and phospholipids. APOE is involved in transport and redistribution of

Longevity in humans is linked to survival-associated genetic pat- terns rather than a dearth of disease-associated variants. Moreover, life expectancy is generally accepted as longer for women than men

Genotyping analysis of CETP I405V (Gudnason et al., 1999) andAPOE (Tagalakis et al., 2005) was performed as previously described. Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR in PTC-225 (MJ Research, USA) and after digestion overnight with Rsa I and Hha I, respectively (Takara, Shuzo), the products were separated by 12% polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Supplemental Fig. 1). The accuracy of genotyping has been further confirmed by Sanger's sequencing in 100 randomly selected cases.

role in the metabolism of cholesterol and TG by binding to receptors on the liver to help mediate clearance of chylomicrons and very low- density-lipoprotein(VLDL)fromthebloodstream.Inaddition,polymor- phisms in the CETP and APOE genes have been reported to possibly confer risk against longevity and lipid homeostasis. CETP I405V poly- morphism is a common SNP (rs5882) in exon 14 of the CETP gene, which was previously identified as a longevity gene (Barzilai et al., 2003). The VV genotype of I405V was reported to be associated with lower CETP concentrations and higher HDL-c concentrations. Isoforms of APOE are produced from haplotype combinations of rs429358 and rs7412 polymorphisms (defining the APOE*ε2, ε3, and ε4 haplotypes). APOE haplotypes have been extensively studied and indicated APOE*4 to be a risk factor for LDL-c, Alzheimer's disease and longevity in some ethnicities. Previous studies by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium indicated that the lipid components might share certain risk susceptible polymorphisms. Our recent pilot study in oldest-old Chinese subjects indicated a different serum lipid pattern in which TG was decreased without an increase of HDL-c as reported in Ashkenazi Jews (Barzilai etal.,2003).Fewstudieshavebeenreportedaboutthegeneticcontribu- tion of CETP and APOE to hTG, especially in oldest-old subjects.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)Windows,version12.0andSTATA10.0software(StataCorp,College Station, TX, USA) was used. Allele frequencies were determined by gene counting and the goodness-of-fit for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was verified using Chi-square analysis. One-way ANOVA or Student t-test were used when comparing continuous variables between groups;Chi-squareanalysisforcategoricalvariable.Backwardconditional logistic regression was conducted in multivariate analysis to estimate the gene–gene interaction item and adjust for the confounding of age, APOE*4 status, alcohol drinking, body mass index (BMI), TC, HDL-c, LDL-c. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were used to estimate the association between variables. An additive model was used to code SNPs for the ‘risk’ allele, the allele that increased the probability of being a case. Accordingly, ‘0’ indicated that the subject was homozygous for the non-risk allele; the heterozygote was coded ‘1’, and those who were homozygous for the risk allele were coded ‘2’. Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR, version 1.2.2) was also used to confirm the gene–gene interaction (epistasis) from the logistic regression analysis (Hahn et al., 2003). We used 10,000 permutations to determine the statistical significance of the best models. These data were also analyzed by using an extension of the MDR algorithm that includes adjustment for covariates, the Generalized Multifactor Dimen- sionality Reduction (GMDR, V0.7) software package. Two-sided P b 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Power were estimated with the program Genetic Power Calculator (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/ ~purcell/gpc/cc2.html) (Purcell et al., 2003).

Gene–gene epistatic interactions are essential to identify genetic markers for polygenic traits that are unable to be captured by single marker analysis and/or revealed by the combinatory effect of loci in other pathways (Ndiaye et al., 2013). Thus, we hypothesized that the polymorphisms of CETP and APOE might interact in the signaling path- way, which could have greater effects on the dysregulation of serum lipids in oldest-old Chinese women. This study was conducted to assess potential CETP*APOE interaction and contribution to dyslipidemia in oldest-old Chinese women by the traditional parametric approach of logisticregressionandthenonparametricmethodofmultifactordimen-

2.1. Subjects

The current study was based on the Longevity and Health of Aging Population in GuangxiChinastudyconducted in 2008 and 2010.Yongfu County has been qualified as the longevity town by Geriatric Society of China in 2007.

3. Results

We analyzed a total of 713 female Chinese subjects, including 372 oldest-old subjects and 340 controls in the present study. Subjects in oldest-old grouphad significantly lower TGand BMI;and higher FPG, LDL-c, HR, SBP and DBP when compared with controls (Table 1).

Sevenhundred andthirteenfemale volunteers,fromurbanand rural areas of Yongfu County, South China, were enrolled after having been excluded from the subjects undertaking lipid-lowering drugs. The longevity group comprised of 16 centenarians (aged 100–109), 322 no- nagenarians(aged90–99)and34octogenarians(aged80–89).Thegeog- raphy and nationality matched control group consisted of 340 unrelated volunteers(aged20–58,meanage41.88± 12.20 years)withoutlongev- ity history (no lineal family members aged above 80 for 3 generations). All subjects self-reported as belonging to Han nationality. The Ethics Committee of Beijing Hospital, Ministry of Health approved the study protocol. All participants were informed and provided with informed consent in writing.

Distributions of CETP and APOE polymorphisms in the oldest-old group and controls were in HWE (Table 2). Comparison between oldest-old and controls showed that, as expected, APOE*4 was less

frequent in oldest-old group (23.5% vs 14.0% in controls vs. oldest-old, respectively; P = 0.001). No contribution of CETP I405V for longevity wasfound(P= 0.347).Stratifiedanalysisintheoldest-oldgroupaccord- ing to the NCEP ATP III criteria suggested that APOE*4 also significantly associated with risk for hTC (P = 0.001) and mixed dyslipidemia (P b 0.001). In addition, we also found that CETP genotype distribut- ed differently between hTG and Control groups (P = 0.002) with hTG a higher proportion of VV genotype in the hTG subgroup (30.5% vs15.7% in hTG vs. controls, respectively).

As noted in Fig. 1, BMI, alcohol drinking, and TC increased the risk of hTG in our oldest-old subjects, and HDL-c significantly decreased the risk (P b 0.05). The odds of hTG for subjects with CETP*V allele was 1.88 times greater than subjects without the risk allele in the univariate polymorphism logistic regression model. After adjustment for APOE*4, age, BMI, alcohol drinking, TC, HDL-c, and LDL-c, the risk contribution was consistent (P b 0.05). When coupled with APOE genotypes contain- ingε4 at least one risk allele,theodds ofbeingaffected increasedto 4.36 times greater for subjects withtheCETP*V allelethan thosewithneither risk allele. In addition, the interaction item estimated by logistic regres- sion between CETP*V and APOE*4 significantly increased the risk of hTG (P = 0.002, OR = 3.25). There was no evidence for an increased risk for hTG due to the presence of APOE*4 itself (P = 0.079). In addition, we failed to repeat the findings that CETP conferred the risk of hTG and the interaction with APOE in our middle-aged controls (data not shown).

As shown in Table 3, according to whether individuals carry the risk allele (APOE*4 and CETP*V), Student t-test suggested higher TC (P = 0.004), TG (P = 0.044) and LDL-c (P = 0.007) in oldest-old females with APOE*4 compared to APOE*ε2, whichwasalso observed in controls (data not shown). In addition, TG was significantly increased in subjects with CETP*V compared to CETP*I (P = 0.003).

A cumulative effect of CETP*V allele was observed to increase the risk forhTG(P = 0.003,OR = 2.989,OR = 1.499).Accordingtothe fortrend VV VI genotypecombinationwithAPOE*4,theriskforhTGincreasedinsubjects with both CETP*V and APOE*4 compared to subjects with neither risk alleles (P = 0.001, OR = 19.091, OR = 1.909). After adjust- for trend VV VI ment for age and BMI (Model 2), association of CETP*V for hTG was con- sistent, whether CETP alone (P = 0.001, OR = 3.264, OR = for trend VV VI 1.335) or coupled with APOE*4 carriers (P = 0.042, OR = for trend VV 7.849, OR = 1.107) in oldest-old females. No contributions of APOE*4 VI for hTG was found with or without covariate adjustment (Table 4).

The exhaustive data mining MDR analysis was used to evaluate the impact of interactions between the genotypes of CETP and APOE poly- morphisms on hTG in oldest-old females. The 2-locus model that com- prised CETP and APOE emerged as the best disease predicting model with the highest level of statistical significance (MDR: TBA = 0.559, CVC = 10/10, P = 0.024; GMDR adjusted for age, BMI and alcohol drinking: TBA= 0.562, CVC = 10/10, P = 0.038).Overall, theparamet- ric and nonparametric results were consistent for the significant inter- actions between CETP and APOE.

phisms in CETP and APOE might be associated with dyslipidemia in oldest-old Chinese women. First, this was especially pertinent since CETP and APOE are functionally related in the maintenance of circulat- ing lipid homeostasis in animal models and middle-aged populations. Second, CETP*405 V was associated with lower CETP protein serum level and activity and corresponding increase in HDL levels and particle sizes (Sanders et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2008). Further, APOE*4 was associated with increased TC and LDL-c levels (Bennet et al., 2007). Therefore, their impacts on human lifespan and longevity were tested in many populations, although the results were inconsistent. Third, our recent pilot study identified lower TG and higher LDL-c levels in oldest-old Chinese compared to controls. The difference of genetic contribution for longevity among populations possibly depends on the specific pattern of serum lipids in the longevity group. Accordingly, we focused on the contribution of CETP*405 V and APOE*4 on longevity and dyslipidemia, including hTG in the oldest-old population.

In this study, except for the increased blood pressure, which might be partly influenced by the decline of vascular elasticity, we observed lower TG levels and less frequent obesity in oldest-old females com- pared to controls, suggesting that the general health status of oldest- old females was comparative to controls. Upon analysis of genotype of CETP I405V and APOE, we only found that APOE*4 increased the risk against longevity. However, concerning the contribution for dyslipid- emia in the oldest-old subjects, in addition to the observation that APOE*4 was associated with risk for hTC and mixed dyslipidemia (mixed-dys) as expected, additive model indicated that CETP*V signifi- cantly associated with hTG. Furthermore, the risk for hTG increased with increasing of CETP*V numbers with or without adjustment for age and BMI. Subjects who carry the risk CETP*V had significant higher risk for hTG compared to CETP*II homozygotes independent from APOE*4, age, BMI, alcohol drinking, TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c. Consistent

a Model 2 was adjusted for age and BMI.

4. Discussion

The recent increase in aging worldwide has drawn an ed focus on human healthy longevity by researchers and the public (Dupre et al., 2008). Dyslipidemia has consistently been to be a significant risk factor for CVD and shorten life expectancy US life tables (Stamler et al., 2000). Because of the gender of longevity subjects in our study andphysiological differences genders, and because the effects of APOE polymorphism were to be stronger in women (Song et al., 2004), we only included

with this observation, TG level was significantly higher in subjects with CETP*V than those with CETP*I.

Conflict of interest

The stratification Chi-square test, multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, and nonparametric MDR analysis all suggested a significant interaction between CETP and APOE associated with hTG for oldest-old female subjects. Although APOE*4 was not strongly associated with hTG in this population, when APOE*4 was analyzed together with CETP*V, more than a fourfold increase in hTG risk was observed for subjects with both risk alleles (Fig. 1).

We are indebted to the participants in the study and their families for their outstanding commitment and cooperation. The study was support- ed by the Beijing Nova program (Z121107002512058), the Natural Science Foundation of China (30972709, 81061120527, 81241082), the major funding from Beijing Hospital (BJ-2010-30), National Department Public Benefit Research Foundation by the Ministry of Health P. R. China (201302008) and 12th 5 year national program from the Ministry of Scientific Technology (2012BAI10B01) and the Key Clinical Program for the Affiliated Hospital of the Ministry of Health (10120101).

We failed to repeat the contribution of CETP for the risk of hTG and the interaction with APOE in our middle-aged controls, but found the impact of APOE alone on TC and LDL-c (data not shown). This might be because of the difference of physiological status between oldest-old and middle-aged groups. Oldest-old subjects are strong survivors by natural selection, including environmental, lifestyle, and aging factors, accompanied with different metabolic characteristics compared to middle-aged subjects, which is the highlight of the study. There might have been a complex mechanism between clinical parameters and longevity in that subjects who met the criteria for oldest-old demon- strated a diverse clinical status.

A challenge for studies such as ours and those that investigate the interactions between polymorphism is to explain the genetic networks between the loci with statistical relationship. CETP is responsible for transfer of CE from HDL in exchange for TG, and, APOE is also essential for the normal catabolism of TG-rich lipoprotein constituents. Thus, CETP and APOE functional polymorphisms could reasonably affect the susceptibility to hTG, especially when exposed to certain physiological environment. Genomewide association study (GWAS) reported many other common loci involved in dyslipidemia, although these common loci account for only 25% to 30% of the genetic variance in lipid level. In addition, the resequencing strategy indicates that rare variants do indeed play a role, in which ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, APOA5, APOB, GCKR, and LPL were associated with triglyceride level (Evans and Diemert, 2012). All these factors are expected to be tested soon in the elderly population to systematically evaluate the contribution.

5. Conclusions

Tothebest of our knowledge,this is thefirststudy to simultaneously investigate thecontributionof CETPand APOE polymorphisms to dyslip- idemia in oldest-old females. Besides the traditional understanding of the association between CETP polymorphism and HDL-c, this study pro- videdevidenceofitseffectonTG,atleastinsub-populations.Theresults provide evidence of strong independent associations between hTG and CETP*Vintheoldest-oldChinesefemalesinthisstudy,andAPOE*4,asan independently non-significant variant, might interact with another var- iant resulting in an increased disease risk. Nevertheless, we fully expect that additional variants, some rare, will be added to the list of polymor- phisms that influence healthy status and life span. It should be noted that this study was conducted based on a limited population because of the rare prevalence of oldest-old in Yongfu (0.0133%). Accordingly, our study is only a first step toward defining a genetic association with hTG in oldest-old Chinese women, and this has to be further repli- cated by long-term prospective studies with larger samples across genders.
