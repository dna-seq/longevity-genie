controls, and (2) alleles in genes associated with Hsp70 explain these differences. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed serum Hsp70 levels from participants enrolled in the New England Centenarian Study (NECS) or the Longevity Genes Project (LGP). The study included 87 LGP centenarians, 93 NECS centenarian offspring, and 126 controls (43 NECS, 83 LGP). We also examined genotypic and allelic frequencies of polymorphisms in HSP70-A1A and HSP70-A1B in 347 centenarians (266 from NECS, 81 from LGP), 260 NECS centenarian offspring, and 238 controls (NECS: 53 spousal controls and 106 septuagenarian offspring controls; LGP: 79 spousal controls). The adjusted mean serum Hsp70 levels for the NECS centenarian offspring, LGP centenarians, LGP spousal controls, and NECS controls were 1.05, 1.13, 3.07, and 6.93 ng/mL, respectively. These results suggest that a low serum Hsp70 level is associated with longevity; however, no genetic associations were found with two SNPs within two Hsp70 genes. 

Heat shock proteins are highly conserved proteins that protect stress-exposed cells when produced intracellularly. Conversely, extracellular heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been shown to have both protective and deleterious effects. In this study, we assessed the potential role of heat shock protein 70 in human longevity. Various studies have examined the relationship of extracellular Hsp70 with aging. Rea et al. demonstrated a progressive decline in serum Hsp70 levels in older age groups in a cross-sectional study of individuals aged between 20 and 96 years. Similarly, Jin et al. demonstrated a decline in serum Hsp70 at older ages in their study of healthy male donors aged between 15 and 50 years. These findings suggest that serum Hsp70 levels decline at older ages; however, they do not indicate whether levels decline over time within an individual. They also do not indicate whether there is a decline in Hsp70 function over time, although in vitro studies suggest that cell lines from centenarians, when exposed to heat stress, have similar Hsp70 synthesis, have a similar transcriptional response to the Hsp70 gene, and are less prone to heat-induced apoptosis when compared to cell lines from younger individuals.

Blood samples were collected from 87 LGP centenarian subjects, 93 NECS centenarian offspring, and 126 spousal controls (NECS controls: 43, LGP: 83). Blood samples were not obtained in the acute phase of an illness. Once collected, the blood samples were divided into aliquots and stored at -80Â°C. The serum was then analyzed using the classical sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method previously described by Rea and co-workers with minor modifications. The interassay variability of the Hsp70 immunoassays was <10%.Controls and (2) alleles in genes associated with Hsp70 explain these differences. Few studies have examined the role of genetics in the relationship between Hsp70 and survival to very old age. Altomare et al. (2003) found that a polymorphism within the hsp70 gene promoter was associated with longevity only in females. Subsequently, Marini et al. (2004) reported that in centenarians, the A/A genotype of the (A/C)-genetic 110 polymorphism in the promoter region was associated with lower expression of Hsp70 protein after heat stress, compared to the C/C genotype. In addition to analyzing serum Hsp70, we examined two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of hsp70 genes for their potential role in exceptional longevity.

2.3. SNP genotyping
Whole blood samples were obtained from 347 centenarians (NECS: 266, LGP: 81), 260 NECS centenarian offspring, and 238 controls (NECS: 53 spousal controls and 106 septuagenarian offspring controls, LGP: 79 spousal controls). Of note, although sera were not available from all NECS subjects for Hsp70 assays, whole blood was available for genetic studies. DNA was isolated from each subject's peripheral blood leukocytes using the Qiagen DNA purification system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Real-time PCR-based SNP genotyping assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems Assays-on-DemandTM and performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction products were analyzed on an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence detection system. HSP70-A1A and HSP70-A1B are encoding gene members of the hsp70 family located within the cluster of human leukocyte antigen class III genes on chromosome 6p21 in the neighborhood of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) locus. These genes share the characteristic of having only one linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. Thus, we genotyped one tagSNP per gene: rs1043618 (hcv 11917510) in HSP70-A1A and rs6457452 (hcv3052604) in HSP70-A1B.

2.1. Study population
The criteria for eligibility, methods of recruitment, and study outcomes of the New England Centenarian Study (NECS) have been published elsewhere (Perls et al., 1999; Terry et al., 2003). Briefly, the NECS is a United States nationwide study of centenarians, their offspring, and controls. The controls include (a) spouses of the centenarian offspring and (b) offspring of individuals.

(TNF) locus. These genes share the characteristic of having only one linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. Thus, we genotyped one tagSNP per gene: rs1043618 (hcv11917510) in HSP70-A1A and rs645745population. It has been proposed that Hsp70 peptide-negative proteins activate the innate immune system, while Hsp70 peptide-bearing proteins stimulate adaptive immunity (reviewed by Asea, 2005; Calderwood et al., 2005; Pockley, 2003). Inflammation is known to contribute to age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (Pockley, 2002; Pockley and Frostegard, 2005), which may explain why centenarian offspring, who are of similar age to controls but have lower rates of cardiovascular disease and risk factors, also have significantly lower serum Hsp70 levels (Terry et al., 2003).

Other studies have investigated Hsp70 levels in older populations. The Italian centenarian study found no difference in intracellular Hsp70 between centenarians and younger controls, but did not examine serum Hsp70. In agreement with our findings, cross-sectional studies in Ireland (Rea et al., 2001) and China (Jin et al., 2004) have shown a decline in serum Hsp70 with age. However, none of these studies, including our own, examined changes in serum Hsp70 over time in the same individuals. Centenarians may differ from other aged subjects since they are a highly selected surviving fraction of the general population. For example, centenarians have larger lipid particle sizes than their offspring and younger controls (Barzilai et al., 2003). However, this does not seem to be the case with Hsp70 since LGP centenarian values were similar to those of the NECS offspring cohort.

It is possible that cell turnover is longer in long-lived groups and their offspring, leading to a delay in the death pathway and consequently less Hsp70 released into the serum. While controls from both studies had significantly elevated serum Hsp70 levels compared to centenarians and centenarian offspring, the NECS controls had higher levels than their LGP counterparts. Both groups had samples collected and Hsp70 assayed using similar methods, making it unlikely that technical differences caused this discrepancy. The LGP controls were younger and comprised more females than the NECS controls, which may account for some of the difference. Additionally, the LGP controls are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent while the NECS controls are ethnically heterogeneous. It is possible that LGP controls share more genetic and environmental traits (i.e., diet and lifestyle) compared to NECS spousal controls, thus abrogating some of the serum Hsp70 elevation. Examining Hsp70 levels in LGP centenarian offspring may shed light on these differences.

Several reasons could explain why serum Hsp70 levels are lower at very old age. It is possible that cells in these individuals are exposed to similar stress levels but have a diminished response from heat shock factor-1 (Hsf-1), which is the transcription factor for Hsp70 and regulates its synthesis in response to stress. Consistent with this, decreased Hsp70 synthesis with age has been shown in both rat hepatocytes (Wu et al., 1993) and human T-lymphocyte cultures (Effros et al., 1994). However, a recent study by Hsu et al. (2003) contradicts this hypothesis since Caenorhabditis elegans forced to overexpress the hsf-1 gene exhibited a 40% greater lifespan than wild-type animals.

While the mechanism behind stress protein release remains uncertain, it is an active process that does not necessarily depend on a loss of cellular viability (Bausero et al., 2005; Gastpar et al., 2005; Hunter-Lavin et al., 2004; Lancaster and Febbraio, 2005). Thus, another possibility is that cells from very old individuals synthesize the same amount of Hsp70 intracellularly but have defective active release mechanisms that prevent Hsp70 from entering circulation. Recent findings demonstrate that disruption of lipid rafts on cell membranes abrogates the release of Hsp70 from live cells (Bausero et al., 2005; Gastpar et al., 2005; Hunter-Lavin et al., 2004; Lancaster and Febbraio, 2005). Depletion of the lipid content of the surface membrane destroys the cell's natural ability to release Hsp70 into the extracellular milieu, resulting in complete abrogation of stress-induced Hsp70 release from cells. Together, these results suggest that Hsp70's association with longevity may be related to factors downstream of gene expression.

The relatively low concentration of serum Hsp70 levels in our study compared to Rea et al., who found that individuals aged 90 and older have serum Hsp70 levels of about 20 ng/mL (Rea et al., 2001), does not contradict either study. A recentPopulation. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not demonstrate any genetic associations that explain the differences in serum Hsp70. This could be a true finding or the consequence of the relatively small sample size of our populations. More likely, it is possible that the differences in serum Hsp70 levels that we demonstrated are a downstream effect of genetic differences elsewhere in the metabolic pathway. Future genetic studies of Hsp70 levels could focus on such genes.

4.3. Conclusions
Our study of serum Hsp70 levels in centenarian offspring compared to controls (Terry et al., 2004) and those of Rea et al. (2001) and Jin et al. (2004) showed that serum Hsp70 levels are lower in individuals who reach an advanced age. In addition, it suggests that low serum Hsp70 levels are associated with longevity independent of other covariates such as age, gender, race, income, alcohol, cardiovascular disease, and a variety of other age-related diseases. No statistically significant associations were found with two tagSNPs within Hsp70 genes. Further investigation is needed to determine why centenarians and centenarian offspring have low levels of serum Hsp70 and to better understand the role of genetic polymorphisms in this observation.
