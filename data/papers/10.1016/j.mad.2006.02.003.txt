Abstract

Deletions of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily genes GSTT1 and GSTM1 has been associated with oxidative stress related diseases and recently explored as factors implicated in longevity as well. Reported results have been conflicting, which may partially be caused by the traditional use of assays unable to discriminate between carriers of one or two functional genes.

Using a quantitative realtime PCR method facilitating quantification of gene copy number, we evaluated the influence of GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletions on longevity in a longitudinal study of 681 elderly Danish twins. The mean follow-up time was 7.6 years and during this time a total of 294 deaths occurred. The results demonstrated a non-significant trend for carriage of two copies of the GSTM1 functional gene to be a protective factor, whereas both heterozygosity and homozygosity for the GSTT1 functional gene was associated with a moderate but significant increased mortality in women (hazard rate 2.46 (CI : 1.43–4.23) and 2.22 (CI : 1.25–3.94) for one and two alleles, respectively). To our knowledge, this is 95 95 the first longitudinal study exploring the influence of GST gene polymorphisms on longevity and these data implies that GST gene copy numbers do affect mortality risk in the elderly.

The GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes are members of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily, comprising genes that encodes a variety of enzymes involved in protection against harmful exogenous substances, such as carcinogens and other xenobiotics, as well as endogenously produced reactive oxygen species (Hayes et al., 2005). Common polymorphisms consisting in deletion of the entire gene has been described for both GSTT1 and GSTM1 leading to a complete lack of activity, and the deletion of one or two alleles (null genotype) has been associated with an increased risk of various types of cancer (Alexandrie et al., 2004; Ates et al., 2005; Rajagopal et al., 2005), asthma and other respiratory diseases (Brasch- Andersen et al., 2004; Tamer et al., 2004).

Muiras et al. (1998) thus found no association between homozygosity for GSTM1 deletions and longevity when comparing 565 French centenarians and 229 younger controls. In a later study using Italian centenarians compared to control subjects of younger age this lack of association was confirmed by Taioli et al. (2001), who on the other hand found a significant increase in the prevalence of GSTT1 deletions in the centenarians.

Soon after, Yamamura et al. (2001) found a decreased frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype in Japanese centenar- ians compared to a younger control group, whereas there was no difference in the prevalence of the GSTT1 null genotype. Conversely, Pesch et al. (2004) recently reported a non- significant trend of GSTT1 deletions being slightly less frequent, and GSTM1 deletions marginally more frequent in 205 German octogenarians compared to a reference group of 294 persons aged less than 80 years old.

As mediators of protection against oxidative stress the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes serve as excellent candidates for studies of successful ageing and longevity. Accordingly, several recent studies have investigated the influence of the presence/

Two obvious explanations may in part account for these discrepancies. First, all four studies use a cross sectional design,

Adjusting for other relevant covariates, such as smoking status, current or previous pulmonary or cancer diseases, as well as other age-related diseases had virtually no effect on the hazard rate estimates.

an approach that could potentially pose a problem since cohort specific characteristics may confound the comparison between the centenarians and younger cohorts. Second, none of these studies discriminated between genotypes with one and two copies of GSTM1 and GSTT1, which probably reduces the power to observe an effect of the polymorphisms and furthermore precludes distinction between the various genetic models.

The suggested protective effect of inheriting two functional GSTM1 genes emphasises the importance of distinguishing between heterozygote and homozygote GSTM1 gene carriers, and may thus explain the lack of association found in previous studies. These results could be explained by a genetic mechanism with a dominantly acting harmful effect of the gene deletion. This contrasts with the general expectation that a deleterious effect of a gene deletion would follow either a recessive or an additive mechanism. However, these are only suggestive results which should obviously be interpreted with caution.

In a previous work, we described the establishment of a multiplex realtime PCR method enabling quantification of gene copy number, which easily discriminate carriers of one or two GSTM1 and GSTT1 alleles (Brasch-Andersen et al., 2004). In the present study, we have used this method to investigate the influence of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletion polymorph- isms on mortality in a longitudinal study of 681 elderly Danish twins (234 men and 447 women), thereby circumventing the potential problems of the cross sectional approach. The included subjects were drawn from the 1997 wave of the population-based survey ‘‘the Longitudinal Study of Ageing Danish Twins’’ comprising all Danish twins age 70 years and older (Skytthe et al., 2002). Information on survival status was retrieved from the Danish Central Population Register, which is continuously updated. The mean follow-up time for survivors was 7.6 years (range 7.1–8.2 years). Only all-cause mortality was recorded as information on cause-specific mortality was unavailable for the main part of the follow-up time included. Genotyping was performed as described (Brasch-Andersen et al., 2004) and all samples were done in triplicates. Mortality risk was estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age. To account for the non-independence of twins, twin pairs where both members participated were analyzed in clusters of two, using the cluster option of the statistical software Stata 8.0.

functional gene is somewhat paradoxical, given the generally accepted assumption that the null genotype is a disease risk factor. However, our data are in accordance with the findings of Taioli et al. (2001) and with a recent study by Geisler et al. (2005) who found that the presence of the GSTT1 gene was a predictor of both overall mortality and disease-specific mortality for patients diagnosed with carcinomas of the head and neck. Furthermore, reports on the influence of GSTT1 null genotypes on cancer susceptibility have not been as unambig- uous as expected, and the presented results may thus reflect a dual role of GSTT1 in detoxification of some hazardous compounds and activation of other toxic substrates occurring with different preference at various stages of life. It is well known that GSTT1 participates in bioactivation of certain compounds, like e.g. dihalogenated alkanes (Sherratt et al., 1997; Shokeer et al., 2005; van Bladeren, 2000), thus suggesting that deletion of the GSTT1 gene may be beneficial under some circumstances.

The basic characteristics shown in Table 1 demonstrate an increased mortality in female carriers of both one and two copies of the GSTT1 gene compared to individuals with the null genotype and this result was confirmed in the Cox regression model provided in Table 2. Furthermore, we found a tendency towards a decreased mortality restricted to individuals carrying two copies of the GSTM1 gene. The latter association, however, did not reach statistical significance, probably due to the rather low number of individuals with two GSTM1 gene copies.

One possible concern is that the GSTT1 genotype distribu- tion in the elderly men deviates from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The observed GSTT1 null allele frequency is somewhat lower than the frequency reported for most younger populations of European origin (19–21% in e.g. Gaspari et al., 2003; Pesch et al., 2004; Taioli et al., 2001), although comparable with the frequency reported in the most similar age range (14% in Pesch et al., 2004). Since the null genotype is

readily distinguished from carriers of one or two GSTT1 alleles using any PCR based assay, it is unlikely that this deviation reflects methodological problems, instead it may simply be a chance finding. In addition, the fact that the effect of the GSTT1 gene on longevity found in this study was restricted to women, without any a priory theory of this being a plausible possibility, implies that these results should be interpreted with caution. However, our results could add support to the hypothesis that longevity factors may be gender-specific and that males and females follow different strategies to reach longevity as previously proposed by other studies (Bellizzi et al., 2005; Christiansen et al., 2004; Lio et al., 2002).

In summary, we find significant evidence that the GSTT1 functional gene is a mortality risk factor in elderly women, and suggestive evidence that homozygosity for GSTM1 functional genes is a protective factor. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study exploring the influence of GST gene polymorphisms on longevity. However, owing to the fairly low number of carriers of two GSTM1 genes as well as carriers of two GSTT1 gene deletions in most populations, studies including large number of participants should be performed to replicate the presented findings.
