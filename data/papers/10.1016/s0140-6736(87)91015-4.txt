histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the gene systems influencing ageing.3 The HLA antigens in man, especially those associated with the HLA-D region, are closely related to autoimmune diseases, cancer, and other such malignancies, as well as to immune responsiveness.4 However, it is not yet known whether such a relation exists between HLA and longevity, though the advantage of HLA heterozygosity5-7 and the disadvantage of AI-B8 haplotype for caucasian women8 have been suggested earlier. The number of centenarians known to have been investigated for the distribution of HLA antigens has far so consisted of 11 Japanese subjects’ and 16 caucasians.9

Okinawa islands, the southernmost part of Japan, are known for the longevity of their populations; the life average expectancy there was 74-52 years for men and 81 72 years for women in 1980 and, according to Ministry of Health and Welfare data,lO in 1984 about 5 per 100 000 of the population centenarians.2 were

Summary

phenotypes in 82 centenarians and 20 nonagenarians in Okinawa, Japan, were compared with those in other healthy adults in various age-brackets. Subjects aged over 90 had an extremely low frequency of HLA-DRw9 and an increased frequency of DR1. In this age-group the relative risk of and corrected (for number of antigens) p value for HLA-DRw9 were 5&middot;2 and 0&middot;0001, respectively; those for HLA-DR1 were 13&middot;3 and 0&middot;0367, respectively. Since a high frequency of DRw9 and a low frequency of DR1 are associated with autoimmune or immune deficiency diseases, the genetic protection against these disorders may contribute to longevity.

Since 1979, 82 strictly verified centenarians and 20 nonagenarians who lived the Okinawa islands on were investigated to compare HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ antigen phenotypes with those of average, normal adults of the same geographic region. In this report, we present the data which suggests that some primary genetic factors, including MHC region genes, are associated with human longevity.

Subjects and Methods

Subjects

The blood samples collected from 82 centenarians (18 were males/64 females) aged 100 to 106 years (average 101. 1 years), 20 nonagenarians (4 males/ 16 females) aged 90 to 99 years (average 96-5), and 159 healthy adults (78 males/81 females), aged 18 to 85 years (average 58-1). Only those found on clinical examination to be in good general health were included in the survey.

Introduction

IT is very rare for man to live beyond 100 years. Environmental factors such lifestyle, diet, and climate as would have a strong influence on longevity. Since long life runs in families,12 so genetic factors probably also contribute to longevity.

The age given by centenarians and nonagenarians was checked against family registers, age of subject at time of major event such as birth records, subjects’ personal recollections, and family war, lineage.2 In cases of even the slightest doubt, subjects were excluded from the

However, significant no difference was found between subjects in an age-group for the normal adults.

HLA Typing

Sixty-one specificities on HLA-A, B, C locus and nineteen on DR, DQ locus were targeted and typed according to standard microdroplet lymphocyte cytotoxicity testll using sera by Dr P. 1. Terasaki, University of California Los and those of the 8th and the 9th International Workshop. In of blanks (ie, unspecified cases type and homozygotes) or difficulties with antigen additional antisera were employed, and, as much as samples were re-typed to ensure accuracy and to minimise error.

Discussion

A clear-cut relation between the H-2 system and maximum lifespan3 and highly strain-dependent, a age- specific incidence of certain diseases, including have malignancies,15 been demonstrated in mice, but the relation between HLA and longevity has never been clear in However, in Orientals, and especially in Japanese, man. most autoimmune diseases are related to HLA-DRw9

Data Analysis

Fisher’s exact probability test was used for the statistical analysis, correction for number of antigens and was two-tailed. Relative (RR) was also calculated and its significance was measured by X2 a simple 2 x 2 table. 12 For the analysis subjects’ ages were taken age at time of collection of final blood samples or age when subject confirmed to be alive.

Results

The centenarians had extremely low phenotype an frequency (PF) of HLA-DRw9 (PF=8-5%; 7/82) when compared with normal adults (308%; 49/159) (table 1). For Okinawan-Japanese, the chances of living beyond 100 years thus 4-8 times higher for those without than for those are with DRw9 (ie, RR 4-8, corrected p [pc] 0-0013). DRw9- B40 (Bw60/w61), commonly found in most Japanese, also occurred infrequently in centenarians (data not shown;

HLA-DR1 No detected in the 159 normal adults was (PF<0-63%), whereas centenarians the PF among was 61% (5/82), which RR of 12-3. The differences gave an between centenarians and controls in other locus antigens not statistically significant at the 5% level.

Since DRw9 is related to genes that contribute to the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases or immune deficiencies, the low frequency of DRw9 the among extremely old people in our study probably helped them to avoid the diseases associated with such genes.

HLA-DRw9 occurs with a higher frequency among oriental populations, including the Japanese, than among caucasian and negroid peoples, and there is inverse an relation between its frequency and those of DR3 and DR7. In caucasian and negroid races DR3 forms the A1-B8-DR3 haplotype and is closely associated with various autoimmune diseases immune deficiencies,27 is DRw9 or as in Japanese. It has also been suggested that this haplotype confers a selective disadvantage on survival among caucasian women;8 and it has not been detected in an investigation of 16 centenarians in Kentucky.9

Experiments with H-2 congenic mice have shown that the longest-lived strains displayed the highest response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), which reflects H-2 diversity throughout most of life.28 As in man, degree of responsiveness to Candida allergen29,30 and to low doses of PHA31 was related to HLA-Dwl or DRl specificity. The uniqueness of the immune status in long-lived mice, including higher responsiveness to low-dose PHA, are also observed in centenarians (Sonoda A, Takata H, unpublished). Moreover, a decreased frequency or absence of DR1 is associated with various Japanese autoimmune diseases (table I), and it has been suggested that HLA-B7 antigen, which forms a strong linkage disequilibrium with DR1 and Dwl in Japanese and which has slightly a increased frequency in the very elderly (data not shown), may protect against various diseases.33 Since we and others7 have found high frequency of DR Japanese people a among aged 90 and since DRI has inverse relation over years, an with DRw9 in Japanese patients with autoimmune diseases, the DRl-carrier’s above-average life span is probably due to selection.

We are not certain as to whether the HLA changes described here are due to the genes that influence the chance of dying of illness, or whether they affect ageing. However, because the HLA antigens MHC region interact or genes with immune response genes or so-called disease susceptibility/protective and with external genes some environmental factors, there is genetic control some over human survival.

On the basis of HLA phenotyping, it is premature to judge whether centenarians are a genetically distinct group. Other investigations required include analysis of DNA, an immune function (including self-recognition), thymic factors, hormone balance, and also differences,34 since sex an above-average life span tends to be commoner in women than in men, not only among caucasians8 but also among Japanese2. Nonetheless, there is clearly extremely high an possibility that DRw9 is a risk factor and DR1 is a favourable factor for longevity in the Okinawan-Japanese. Our investigation strongly suggests that some primary genetic factors, including MHC region associated genes, are with the determination of longevity in human-beings.
