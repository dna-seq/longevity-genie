Background: Aging is by diverse environmental and genetic risk factors. The SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1) gene has been shown to regulate lifespan and aging in previous studies. We determined whether variation in the SIRT1 gene is associated with aging in healthy Chinese population. Methods: The study population comprised 482 healthy, unrelated Chinese subjects, of which 246 were aging individuals from 60 to 91 years old, and 236 younger individuals from 35 and 59 years old. All subjects were from Shenyang, China. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were analyzed: rs3758391 near the 5′ end of the SIRT1 gene; and rs4746720, in the 3′ untranslated region. Results: Differences in allele and genotype frequency were seen between the groups, with rs3758391/C more common than rs3758391/T in the aging subjects (odds ratio=1.453, p=0.026), and with rs3758391/CC more common than rs3758391/CT and rs3758391/TT in the aging subjects (odds ratio=3.042, p=0.027). For the 3′ SNP, rs4746720/C was more common than rs4746720/T in the aging subjects (odds ratio=1.347, p=0.022), and rs4746720/CC was more common than rs4746720/CT and rs4746720/CT in the aging subjects (odds ratio=1.461, p=0.049). The haplotype frequency distribution was also different, with haplotype CC more common in the older group (odds ratio=1.63, p=0.01). Conclusion: These results suggest that SIRT1 gene polymorphisms may add a new factor on the multifactorial genetic contributions to aging.

1. Introduction

changes in a mouse model of genomic instability. A moderate increase in SIRT1 confers resistance to aging-related oxidative stress and apoptosis and appears to be beneficial for aging [8,9].

Aging is a progressive function decline process at the cellular and organism levels. The interaction of genetic and environmental factors contributes to the aging process. Genetic factors and life span correlate, implying a relatively strong genetic contribution to the human aging process [1,2]. Mammals possess seven sirtuins, encoded by SIRT1–SIRT7 [3,4]. The SIRT2 gene is the first gene discovered in the sirtuin family, and was associated with extended life span in several organisms. SIRT1 is a mammalian NAD+-dependent deacetylase homolog of yeast SIRT2. The SIRT1 gene has been shown to regulate lifespan and aging in model organisms that include yeast, C. elegans and rodents [5].

hasbeenconductedonhealthyagingpopulations,eventhoughSIRT1isan important candidate gene for retarding aging and forestalling the onset of age-associated diseases [10,11]. Recently, the Leiden 85 plus extremely aging Study found that the rs3758391 T-allele of the SIRT1 gene was associated with high cognitive function in Dutch people [12]. But the Leiden 85-plus Study, a study conducted on German subjects and a study in a Belgian Caucasian population did not find that the SIRT1 sequence variation influenced exceptional extremely aging in the German, Dutch and Belgian populations [12–14]. An association study of SIRT1 gene variation and visceral obesity in Belgian Caucasians found that the rs7069102 C-allele ofSIRT1 is associated with reduced risk of obesity [13]. Since obesity may accelerate the aging process [15], SIRT1 gene variability may contribute to changes in SIRT1 and correlate with the aging process.

SIRT1 antagonizes cellular senescence by activating ERK/S6K1 signaling in human diploid fibroblasts [6]. The SIRT1 activator resveratrol extends life span and improves glucose homeostasis in mice by stimulating SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of the transcrip- tional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 α) [7]. Increased SIRT1 expression promotes survival, and suppresses age-dependent transcriptional

Since the result obtained in other populations were not suitable Chinese people, in order to explore the potential role of variation in the SIRT1 gene in Chinese aging people, we conducted a study that uses a healthy Han Chinese population to investigate two functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SIRT1: rs3758391, which is near the 5′ end of the SIRT1 gene; and rs4746720, which is in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR).

2. Methods

Haploview4.2 software and the allele frequency in public database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) in SIRT1 gene region (GeneID:23411). We downloaded the China Han population's SNP data of SIRT1 gene from HapMap data base (HapMap Genome Browser ( phases 1, 2 and 3 — merged genotypes and frequencies )). We then analysed these data by Haploview4.2 software [18] and got 3 TagSNPs: rs11596401, rs2236319 and rs4746720. We searched for aging-related articles of 3 SNPs in NCBI database. We did not find any related research article with rs11596401. We found several aging-related articles for rs2236319, but none were found for rs2236319 [12,19]. rs11596401 and rs2236319 both lie in intron regions, but since SNPs in intron region are commonly considered as non-functional SNPs, this study selected the TagSNP rs4746720 which lies in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). After combining the SNP frequency of SIRT1 gene from Hapmap database and NCBI SNP database, we did not find suitable SNPs in SIRT1 gene exon regions, so, we select the rs3758391 near the 5' end of the SIRT1 gene which correlate with aging in other population studies [12,46]. From the selected SNPs, we were able to find rs3758391 near the 5' end of the SIRT1 gene and rs4746720 in the 3' untranslated region. DNA was extracted from white blood cells by a standard phenol/chloroform method [20]. Primers were designed using the Web program Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). Primers for SIRT1 rs3758391 and rs4746720, and extension primers are in Table 1. Genotyping of SIRT1 SNPs used Snapshot primer extension assays (ABI). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed with high-quality hot-start enzyme (HotStarTaq polymer- ase) and landing type (Touch-Down PCR, TD-PCR) technology. PCR products were purified using a Watson DNA Purification Kit (Watson Company, Shanghai, China). The snapshot kit was used for single base extension reaction, with 1 unit SAP for purification of the micro- sequencing product. Resulting fluorescently labeled products were

2.1. Study subjects

Healthy Chinese Han people were recruited for this study. ""Based on “The Developing of China Aging Career”[16], those who are ≥60 years old were classified as aging and those who are b60 years old as young. A representative sample of 669 apparently healthy community-dwelling men and 684 women between 35 and 91 years old were recruited from Shenyang in the LiaoNing Province of China. All participants signed informed consent forms after receiving a clear explanation of the potential risks of the study.

All participants had normal physical examinations. Normal brain function examinations included Pfeffer's Outpatient Disability Ques- tionnaire, Verbal Fluency Test, Mini-Mental State Examination, Activity of Daily Living, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale , The Stroop Color–Word Test, Clock Drawing Test, and Digit Span. Laboratory findings for hemogram, peripheral smear, urine, electrolytes, chest X-ray, kidney ureter bladder, abdominal ultra- sound, pulmonary function, echocardiography (including heart and carotid artery), and ECG were all normal (Fig. 1). The final group was 482 healthy unrelated individuals, including 246 aging and 236 control young individuals. The subject selection method was similar with our previous study [17]. This research was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Experimentation of China Medical University-Shenyang, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent amendments.

The candidate SNPs were selected based on previous study reports. The SNPs associated with aging combined the result analyses by

2.3. Statistical analysis

The HWE (Hardy Weinberg equilibrium) test and linkage disequilibrium test were performed by Genepop 3.4 software [21] and Haploview software [18], respectively. The haplotype estimation was conducted by Phase 2.1 software [22,23]. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software package (SPSS ver. 13.0, Chicago, IL). The genotype, alleles and haplotype frequencies in both groups were compared by Pearson's chi square test. The 2-tailed pb0.05 was considered significant.

3. Results

We screened 482 unrelated healthy Chinese subjects for 2 well- known functional polymorphisms near the 5' end of SIRT1, and in the 3' UTR. For a comparative analysis of genotypes, the cohort of subjects was divided into 2 groups: 236 young subjects, from 35 to 59 years old (mean±SD: 47.3±7.2 years; 45.3% male); and 246 aging subjects, from 60 to 91 years old (71.2±7.1 years; 49.2% male). All SIRT1 polymorphisms were in HWE for the entire cohort of subjects (pN0.05). We explored linkage disequilibrium between the 2 SNPs, and found linkage (D' value: 0.64, r2=0.07 for rs3758391 and rs4746720).

of SIRT1 with the NF-kappaB, FoxO and p53 signaling systems might resist stress, modulate aging-associated disease, delay the aging process and extend lifespan [29,36,37]. As a key regulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis [35,38], SIRT1 has also been linked to increases in maximum lifespan mediated by calorie restriction. SIRT1 activates a critical component of calorie restriction in mammals [39,40], and calorie restriction activates SIRT1 [41] . SIRT1 interacts with the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway [42–44], promotes fat mobilization [40], improves insulin sensitivity [45], reduces the incidence of age-related disease, slows the pace of aging, and increases maximum lifespan [10,11].

Differences in allele and genetype frequency were seen between the groups (Table 2): rs3758391/C is more common than rs3758391/T in aging subjects (odds ratio=1.453, p=0.026), rs3758391/CC is more common than rs3758391/CT and rs3758391/TT in aging subjects (odds ratio=3.040, p=0.027). For the 3' SNP, rs4746720/C was more common than rs4746720/T in aging subjects (odds ratio=1.347, p=0.022), rs4746720/CC was more common than rs4746720/CT and rs4746720/CT in aging subjects (odds ratio=1.461, p=0.049). Genotype distributions and allele frequen- cies showed no differences in different genders (Table 3).

We have little knowledge about the polymorphism of SIRT1 gene with healthy aging at present, although there are several studies on the association between the SNPs and aging. In 2006, the relationship between 5 SNPs (rs3758391, rs1885472, rs2273773, rs10997870, and rs2234975) in SIRT1 gene and 1026 unrelated German long-lived individuals (mean age: 98.3 years) were studied but found no association between SIRT1 genes polymorphisms and exceptional human longevity [14]. In 2007, the relationship between five SNPs (rs3758391, rs3740051, rs2236319, rs2273773, and rs3818291) in SIRT1 gene and 1245 (mean age: 85+ years) unrelated Netherlands people were studied. They were able to observe associations between better cognitive functioning and rs3758391 T-allele [12]. In 2008, the relationship between four SNPs (rs12778366, rs3740051, rs2236319, and rs2273773) inSIRT1geneand326FinnishAlzheimer's disease (mean age: 72.1±6.8 years) were studied but found no association between SIRT1 genes polymorphisms and AD risk in the Finnish population [19]. In 2010, the relationship between a SNPs rs3758391 in SIRT1 gene and 519 Mexico City subjects (mean age:

Statistical analysis on the SNP haplotypes showed that the CC haplotype was significantly increased in the aging group compared to the younger individuals (odds ratio=1.63, p=0.01; Table 4). A frequency of less than 0.03 was considered negligible. As shown in Table 4, the other estimated haplotypes of CC, TC and TT were distributed similarly among young and aging subjects, and showed no significant differences.

4. Discussion

SIRT1 induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, attenuates apoptosis [5,24], and regulates premature cellular senescence [25]. Our previous work suggested that apoptosis might be an important factor in endothelial senescence and vascular aging [26], and SIRT1 might influence aging through attenuation of p53-dependent apo- ptosis [27,28]. SIRT1 evolved to bind or deacetylate a wide variety of factors that affect aging [29,30], including NF-kappaB [31], FOXO [32,33], p53 [27,34], and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) [35]. Interaction

53.44±7.42 years) were studied which resulted to observed associations between T2D and rs3758391 T-allele [46]. All in all the previous study found that rs3758391 may be associated with aging.

We investigated whether genetic variation at the SIRT1 locus correlates with the aging in a healthy Chinese population and found a meaningful divergence in genotypes distribution between aging and young, with an OR of 1.453 and 1.347 in C-allele. This indicates that carriers of the variant C-alleles of rs3758391 and rs4746720 have a high risk of aging than non-carriers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of polymorphisms in the SIRT1 gene that is linked to healthy aging people. This intriguing outcome, viz. frequency of rs3758391 T-allele, was more in young than aging group in healthy Han Chinese people, was consistent with a recent work which reported that T-allele of rs3758391 in SIRT1 gene was associated with high cognitive function in Dutch people [12].

No association was detected between the SNP rs3758391 and extremely aging in German [14] and Dutch populations [12]. But in our study, we found that rs3758391 is associated with the healthy aging Chinese population. These might be because of the different genetic background in different population and the study in German and Dutch people were 85+ long-lived individuals (LLI) as against the 60+ aging people in this study. rs4746720, which was a TagSNP of SIRT1 gene in Chinese Han population, is in the 3' UTR. In some previous studies, there was only a little research about rs4746720 and this is perhaps because of the difference in selected pressure, i.e., rs4746720 is a TagSNP in Chinese population but not as a TagSNP in other populations. In our study, we found that frequency of rs4746720 T-allele frequency was a protective factor in healthy Han Chinese people.

The haplotypes employed here are likely to have captured some of the variation present in the SIRT1 genomic region for the population analyzed in this study. Four frequent SIRT1 haplotypes were identified, and haplotype 1 was found has a significant difference between aging and young groups (OR=1.63, p=0.01). Our findings suggest that certain SIRT1 gene variations may influence human aging in Chinese population. In future studies, we would compare the density of mRNA and protein of SIRT1 in the aging and control groups in order to identify the relationship between 2 SNPs and aging.

Our aim was to determine if an association exists between SIRT1 polymorphisms and healthy aging. In conclusion, this study showed that 2 SIRT1 gene polymorphisms may influence aging in healthy Han Chinese population. The use of healthy subjects excluded interference from some confounding factors such as age-related diseases, cancer and other diseases. All subjects in this study lived in the same city and all subjects were Han, so their environment and genetic background was similar, ruling out the pressure of selection interference. Since the sample size was small, this study might be considered a preliminary and initial work. The findings presented here may add a new factor to information on the multifactorial genetic contributions to aging.
