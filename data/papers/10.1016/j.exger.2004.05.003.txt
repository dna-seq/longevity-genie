Abstract

Natural killer (NK) cells play a pivotal role in the innate immune response. During the ageing process, variations occur in NK cell number and function. The cytolytic activity of NK cells is controlled by an array of activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors, including the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). In the present study, genetic diversity of the KIR loci was analysed with respect to successful ageing in the Irish population. A PCR–SSOP KIR gene identification system was employed to determine the frequency of the named KIR genes/pseudogenes and KIR genotypes within a healthy aged cohort and young control group. Although, two KIR genes (2DS3, 2DL5) displayed an initial increased frequency in the aged group, the significance of this association was lost when repeated in a second cohort. In view of the lack of studies to date, investigating the role of the KIR gene system in healthy ageing, further analysis of KIR diversity is required to fully elucidate it’s role in respect to age-related disease and longevity.

1. Introduction

Natural killer (NK) cells play a pivotal role in the innate immune response and an increase in the number of NK cells is observed in the healthy elderly due to expansion of the functionally mature NK cell subset (McNerlan et al., 1998; Solana et al., 1999). Accompanying the rise in NK cell number, a decrease in cytotoxic capacity occurs on a per cell basis and thus overall NK cell cytoxicity in the healthy aged is maintained at a level comparable to young controls (Di Lorenzo et al., 1999; Miyaji et al., 2000). Studies suggesting that impaired NK cell activity is associated with atherosclerosis and death due to infection in the elderly have also been reported (Bruunsgaard et al., 2001; Ogata et al., 2001). These findings support the hypothesis that a well- preserved NK cell activity is important for successful ageing

Deterioration of the immune system with age (immu- nosenescence) and the associated increased susceptibility of the elderly to infectious disease, cancer and autoimmune disorders, have led to extensive investigation of immune parameters in the aged (Pawelec and Solana, 1997; Franceschi et al., 2000a; Malaguarnera et al., 2001). Several studies have reported a decline in T cell number and function and a decrease in B cell number, which collectively would result in impaired cellular and humoral immune responses (reviewed by Ginaldi et al., 1999). Accompanying the decline in adaptive immune function, alterations in certain cells that mediate non-specific immunity are also observed.

Due to their role in the innate response, NK cells provide a ‘first line of defence’ against infectious agents and cancer (Malnati et al., 1993; Biron et al., 1999; Wu and Lanier, 2003), and are also thought to play a role in autoimmunity (Shi et al., 2000; Singal et al., 2000). NK cells mediate their immune function through the recognition and lysis of

Fig. 1. KIR are type I transmembrane glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They possess a cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, linker region and either two (KIR2D) or three (KIR3D) extracellular Ig-like domains (Salter et al., 1997; Marsh et al., 2002). The three extracellular domains are organised into a membrane distal, a middle and a membrane proximal domain that are known as the D0, D1 and D2 Ig-like domains, respectively (Middleton et al., 2002). Members of the KIR family also possess short (S) and long (L) forms of cytoplasmic tail. These arise as a result offrameshifts caused by insertions and/or deletions of 1–4 nucleotides within the exons that encode the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. KIRs with short cytoplasmic tails transmit activating signals via the interaction of a charged amino acid residue, within the transmembrane region, with DAP12, an adaptor molecule, which contains immunoreceptor tyrosine, based activation motifs (ITAMs) (Lanier et al., 1998). Long-tailed KIRs transduce inhibitory signals by virtue of the immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (I/VxYxxL/V) that are present in their cytoplasmic tails (Bruhns et al., 1999). KIR2DL4 contains signature sequences of both activating and inhibiory KIRs (Selvakumar et al., 1996).

abnormal cells that either lack the expression, or express inadequate amounts, of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules (Ljunggren and Karre, 1990). The ability of NK cells to discriminate between normal and HLA class I-deficient cells is due to the expression of clonally distributed HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptors (Radaev and Sun, 2003). Subsequent NK cell-mediated lysis of HLA class I deficient cells arises from the expression of HLA class I-specific activating receptors by NK cell clonal populations (Biassoni et al., 2000).

The KIR loci map to chromosome 19q13.4 within a region termed the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) (Wagtmann et al., 1997). At present, approximately 15 expressed KIR genes have been identified and these are classified into four major groups (KIR2DS, 3DS, 2DL, 3DL) on the basis of the structural organisation and function of the receptors they encode (Fig. 1) (Marsh et al., 2002). In addition, two KIR pseudogenes have been identified (Martin et al., 2000; Wilson et al., 2000). These are named KIR2DP1 and KIR3DP1, reflecting the high sequence homology they share with two-domain and three-domain KIR genes, respectively.

NK cells express two structurally distinct classes of receptor that control effector function through HLA class I interactions; the C-type lectin-like heterodimer receptors (Lazetic et al., 1996; Carretero et al., 1997) and receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-SF) (Arm et al., 1997; Meyaard et al., 1997; Cantoni et al., 1999; Fanger et al., 1999). Whilst members of the CD94/NKG2 lectin-like receptors are encoded by a relatively conserved set of genes, many of the NK cell receptors belonging to the Ig-SF display considerable genetic variation, in particular, the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs).

In the present study, a PCR–SSOP typing system was implemented to determine the KIR genotype of a cohort of healthy aged Irish subjects in comparison to a younger control group to ascertain whether a particular repertoire of receptors is associated with successful ageing.

2. Materials and methods

The KIR gene family represents a highly diverse class of receptor-encoding genes. Within the human population, remarkable genetic diversity at the KIR region has been observed (Crum et al., 2000; Hsu et al., 2002a; Norman et al., 2002; Uhrberg et al., 2002). This phenomenon arises from variation in KIR gene type and number, which stems from KIR polygenism, coupled with allelic diversity at individual loci (Shilling et al., 2002). It is postulated that the occurrence of random point mutations and recombination between homologous KIR genes represent two mechanisms underlying KIR polymorphism (Witt et al., 1999).

2.1. Subjects

One hundred unrelated control samples (59% female, 41% male with an age-range of 19–45 years old) were chosen at random from the DNA bank of anonymous healthy Caucasian individuals from the Northern Ireland population, stored at the Northern Ireland Histocompat- ibility and Immunogenetics Laboratory (NIHIL), Belfast City Hospital. Ninety-three unrelated aged samples (70% female, 30% male with an age-range of 80–97 years old)

STudy (BELFAST) were also included in the study (Rea et al., 2000). A second subset of 89 unrelated healthy control samples (69% female, 31% male with an age-range of 19–45 years) from the NIHIL DNA bank and 89 unrelated aged samples (70% female, 30% male with an age-range of 80–97 years) from the BELFAST study were analysed in an attempt to confirm any significant findings, following analysis of the first cohort of samples. All aged DNA samples were from healthy elderly Caucasian individuals from the BELFAST study of the Northern Ireland population displaying no signs of age-related disorders, still living independently and approximating SENIEUR status (Ligthart et al., 1984, 1990). Ethical approval was obtained from the Queen’s University of Belfast ethics committee.

Hybridisations, stringent washes and chemiluminescence detection of the hybridised digoxigenin-labelled probes were carried out as previously reported (Williams et al., 1999). The DNA sequences of the probes and their empirically determined stringent wash temperatures and concentrations are given in Table 2.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Fisher’s exact probability tests were performed with Microstate software to assess the statistical significance of frequency differences observed between the aged and control groups. Where applicable, multiple comparisons were taken into consideration by applying Bonferroni’s correction, a¼ 1 2 0: 951=n (where n is equal to the number of comparisons).

Genomic DNA from all subjects was extracted from the buffy coats of peripheral blood by the salting out method (Miller et al., 1988).

3. Results

PCR amplification was performed using the appropriate primer combinations for each target region (Table 1) in 100 ml reaction volumes containing 67 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.8; 16 mM (NH ) SO ; 2.0 mM MgCl ; 0.01%(w/v) 4 2 4 2 Tween; 200 mM of each dNTP; 0.2 mM of each primer; 3 units Taq polymerase (Bioline, London, UK); 0.1–0.5 mg DNA. After an initial denaturation step of 96 8C for 5 min, the cycling conditions specified in the legend of Table 1 were employed for each target region. After the final cycle, the samples were held at 72 8C for 5 min and then at 15 8C until removed from the PCR machine. Successful amplification

In the present study, diversity within KIR gene content was examined to determine its effect on ageing within the Irish population.

A high degree of variation was observed within the sample groups examined, with a total of 24 different genotypes being detected. The gene content of each of these genotypes and their frequency within each sample group analysed are displayed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Of the 24 genotypes identified during this study, 14 were

encountered in both sample cohorts (1, 2, 3/9, 4, 5/10, 6, 7, 7a, 8, 12/17, 13, 15, 24, 27), five genotypes were observed to be unique to the controls (11, 19, 22, 23, 32), and five were detected only in the cohort of aged subjects (20, 28, 29, 30, 31). Within the 14 gene repertoires that were common to both the aged and control subsets, the same four KIR

genotypes were most frequent in both sample groups (1, 2, 3/9, 4). Although, these common KIR gene repertoires collectively account for the majority of genotypes encoun- tered in both the aged subjects and young controls (63 and 68%, respectively), rare KIR gene repertoires form a considerable proportion of the total genotype pool of both

The genotype numbering system is in accordance with that previously reported (Middleton et al., 2002). Only a proportion of the KIR genotypes previously encountered within the Irish population (unpublished data) were detected during this study. Genotypes identified during this study are shown in italics. Solid boxes denote positivity for a KIR gene whilst white boxes denote their absence.

and accepted trends in the frequencies of certain KIR genes were also observed. In agreement with previous studies (Witt et al., 1999; Crum et al., 2000; Middleton et al., 2002), activating KIR genes were present at a much lower frequency within the sample groups investigated than genes encoding inhibitory receptors. In addition, the KIR2DL4, 3DL2, 3DL3 and 3DP1 genes were present in all individuals examined, whilst the frequencies of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2 were identical to KIR2DP1 and KIR2DS2, respectively.

the sample groups, with these repertoires displaying a marginally higher frequency in the aged subset relative to the controls (37 and 32%, respectively).

A comparison of the frequency of individual KIR gene repertoires within the aged subset and control group failed to reveal a statistically significant level of genotypic variation between the two samples groups. Interestingly, several KIR genotypes displayed notable differences in frequency when the aged and control cohorts were segregated according to gender (Table 4). In the aged males, the frequency of genotype 3/9 was considerably reduced in comparison to the young male controls (7 vs 27%). Similarly, a marked decline in the frequency of genotype 1 was apparent in the aged females compared to the young female controls (25 vs 41%). However, due to the limited number of males and females within each sample group, acceptable statistical analysis could not be performed on these data.

Analysis of the frequency of each KIR gene in the complete aged and control subsets revealed that all KIR gene frequencies were comparable in both sample groups, with the exception of KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5. The frequencies of both of these KIR genes were significantly increased in the aged subset compared to the young controls (KIR2DS3, 41 vs 25%, uncorrected p-value 0.02, and KIR2DL5, 59 vs 45%, uncorrected p-value 0.03). Interest- ingly, the KIR gene frequencies of the young controls were similar to data previously obtained for a healthy Irish control group ðn ¼ 512Þ (data not shown), reflecting a true increase in KIR2DS3 and 2DL5 frequency in the aged sample group. When KIR gene frequencies were analysed with respect to gender, both the KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5 genes displayed an increased frequency in aged males

To further analyse these results, the frequency of each of the KIR genes/pseudogenes were examined in the aged and control sample cohorts to assess whether a particular KIR gene may influence longevity within the Irish population. The frequency of each of the KIR genes within the aged and control sample groups are displayed in Table 5. Each of the currently known KIR genes were detected during this study

were examined for determination of the KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5 frequencies (Table 6). In contrast to the initial result, both the KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5 frequencies observed within the second aged subset were comparable to that of the second group of young controls (KIR2DS3, 21 vs 25% and KIR2DL5, 40 vs 45%). Hence, the significant increase in the frequencies of these two genes that was detected in the first cohort of elderly subjects, was subsequently lost.

an individual KIR gene, rather than a combination of several genes, and successful ageing could be identified, the frequencies of named KIR genes/pseudogenes were ana- lysed in both the aged and control cohorts. Through this analysis, a significant association was observed for the KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5 genes in the healthy elderly before applying Bonferroni’s correction, suggesting that these KIR genes may play a role in successful ageing. When a second cohort of aged individuals and control subjects were analysed for the presence of KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5, the significance of this finding was lost (Table 6). It is, however, interesting to note that both activating and inhibitory KIR genes encode receptors with immune functions that clearly have the potential to optimise NK cell activity in the elderly, thereby contributing to prolonged lifespan.

were combined, an increase in the frequencies of both of these KIR genes was observed in the complete aged group relative to the total control group (KIR2DS3, 31 vs 24% and KIR2DL5, 50 vs 44%) (Table 6). However, the difference in the frequencies of these two genes between the elderly and young control groups was not statistically significant, and their observed frequencies in both these sample groups were comparable to those previously obtained for a large healthy Irish control group ðn ¼ 512Þ (data not shown).

Certain activating KIR genes encode NK receptors that induce cytolysis of abnormal cells displaying reduced HLA class I expression. Hence, the increased prevalence of such a KIR gene in the healthy aged may reflect a role for the activating receptor it encodes in providing an improved level of innate immune protection against virus infection and cancer. The precise mechanism through which this may be fulfilled tempts some degree of speculation. It is conceivable that certain activating KIR genes may be readily up-regulated in their expression, in response to oncogenesis and infection. If this were the case, such an activating KIR may confer improved NK cell-mediated killing of abnormal cells and thus eliminate viral infections and tumour cells more efficiently.

4. Discussion

NK cells play a pivotal role in the innate immune response and mediate their immune function through the elimination of abnormal cells that display compromised HLA class I expression. The cytolytic activity of NK cells is regulated through the expression of a plethora of activating and inhibitory receptors with HLA class I ligand specificity, such as the KIRs. In the present study, the potential role of KIR diversity in immunosenescence and longevity was investigated in the Irish population.

Inhibitory KIRs also mediate an immune function capable of modulating NK cell activity, which again may provide beneficial effects that contribute to healthy ageing. Certain inhibitory KIR genes encode receptors that prevent NK cell-mediated lysis of healthy autologous cells with normal levels of HLA class I expression. Hence, optimal functional activity of inhibitory KIRs is crucial in prevent- ing self-reactivity and autoimmune disorders. If the mechanisms controlling the expression levels of inhibitory KIR genes became dysfunctional, the reduced cell surface expression of HLA class I restricted inhibitory KIRs may permit NK cell-mediated lysis of healthy autologous cells expressing normal levels of HLA class I. This scenario may arise via the interaction of HLA class I independent activating NK receptors with their ligands. A possible class of receptor that may mediate this effect are the natural cytotoxicity receptors, which possess ligands other than HLA class I that are expressed by normal autologous cells (Moretta et al., 2000). Thus, in the context of ageing, it is conceivable that certain inhibitory KIR genes may be more susceptible to aberrant expression and thus may provide an increased disposition to the development of autoimmune

A PCR–SSOP typing system that determines the presence or absence of the currently known KIR genes, was applied to a cohort of healthy aged individuals and young control subjects, in order to elucidate their KIR genotypes. Subsequent analysis of the data obtained, failed to identify an individual KIR genotype that was associated with successful ageing, thereby suggesting that the poly- genic nature of the KIR loci may not be a major influence in longevity. A considerably high level of genotypic diversity was encountered in the sample groups investigated. This phenomenon was not entirely unexpected as the polygenic nature of the KIR permits variation in KIR gene type and number between individuals, and has previously been observed to manifest itself in the existence of high levels of genotypic diversity within the human population (Uhrberg et al., 1997; Witt et al., 1999; Crum et al., 2000; Hsu et al., 2002b; Shilling et al., 2002), In the context of the present study, such an extreme level of genotype diversity makes the identification of a specific KIR gene combination

study, the differences observed in the KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5 frequencies between the first and second aged cohorts are unlikely to arise from variation in geographical location has both groups were part of the BELFAST study, and overall the small and homogeneous nature of the Northern Ireland Caucasian population dramatically lowers the potential for diversity in ancestral geographical origin and the bias that this may introduce.

disorders. Conversely, other inhibitory KIR genes may offer a protective effect against self-reactivity and autoimmunity.

In recent years, it has been postulated that gender is a variable concerning the genetics of ageing (Franceschi et al., 2000b) and studies have shown that men and women may follow different pathways to extreme longevity. The most notable of these have examined possible gender-specific markers of longevity within loci that regulate the immune response, namely the polymorphic HLA and cytokine networks (Rea and Middleton, 1994; Bonafe et al., 2001; Lio et al., 2002; Olivieri et al., 2002). To highlight possible gender-specific markers of longevity within the KIR gene network, KIR genotype and gene frequencies were analysed with respect to gender. Interestingly, two KIR genotypes (1 and 3/9) and two KIR genes (KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2) displayed gender-specific variations in frequency between aged subjects of a particular sex and young controls of the same gender. The two KIR genotypes displayed a gender- associated decrease in frequency relative to controls, with genotype 1 decreased in aged females and genotype 3/9 decreased in aged males. This suggests that certain combinations of KIR genes may exert subtle gender- dependent effects during the ageing process. Conversely, the KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2 genes displayed an increased prevalence in aged females relative to young female controls, suggesting these genes may have beneficial effects that extend the lifespan of members of this sex.

Although, the present study does not support a role for KIR diversity in ageing, considerably more research is required to elucidate the precise role that NK cells play in longevity. Further studies, based on larger pooled sample groups, aimed at investigating whether the polymorphic nature of the genes encoded within the LRC is important in ageing, are also required. This initial study will allow more focussed attention on this region and will aid in the analysis by permitting meta-analysis with future studies, helping to overcome the problem of sample numbers that hinder studies in successful ageing. In addition, the formation of immunogenetic profiles for healthy elderly individuals incorporating parameters such as cytokine gene polymorph- ism profiles with HLA and KIR haplotypes, will aid our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie immunosenescence and longevity.

With respect to NK cell activity, both cytokines and HLA class I molecules mediate important immunomodulatory functions—for example, certain cytokines including IL-2, IL-15 and IL-18 are capable of inducing NK cell activity (Perussia, 1996), while HLA class I molecules are the ligands for certain activating and inhibitory KIRs. In parallel with the KIR gene network, both the HLA and cytokine systems display considerable levels of poly- morphic variation (Ross et al., 2003a,b). Hence, it is plausible that the polymorphic nature of each of these gene systems manifests itself in the existence of a myriad of cytokine, HLA, and KIR haplotypes that circulate within the human population. With respect to the ageing process, it is certainly conceivable that epistatic interactions between particular cytokine, HLA, and KIR haplotypes may contribute to the generation of a dynamic immune response that supports successful ageing, whereas certain other haplotype combinations may produce sub-optimal levels of immunity and reduced lifespan.

The present study aimed to investigate the potential role that KIR diversity may play in immunosenescence and longevity within the Irish population. However, no significant association between successful ageing and KIR gene content was observed. A number of reasons could help explain this lack of association; sample numbers are always a concern when examining regions of extreme genetic diversity and the use of two independent aged sampling cohorts was employed to try and minimise any false- positive findings of association.
