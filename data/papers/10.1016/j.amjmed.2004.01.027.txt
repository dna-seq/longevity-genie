Interleukin 6 was determined by a commercially available im- mulite assay.

PURPOSE: We recently demonstrated that a polymorphism in codons 22 and 23 of the glucocorticoid receptor gene is associ- ated with relative glucocorticoid resistance, greater insulin sen- sitivity, and lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In the present study, we investigated whether the ER22/ 23EK polymorphism is associated with survival, cholesterol lev- els, and two predictors of mortality: serum C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 levels.   METHODS: We studied 402 men (mean [ SD] age, 77.8

RESULTS: After a follow-up of 4 years, 73 (19%) of 381 non- carriers died, while none of the 21 ER22/23EK carriers had died  (P 0.03). C-reactive protein levels were about 50% lower in ree= ER22/23EK carriers (P 0.01). There were no differences in interleukin 6 levels.

in codons 22 and 23 of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (GAGAGG [GluArg, or ER] 3 GAAAAG [GluLys, or EK]) is associated with relative glucocorticoid resistance (2). This ER22/23EK variant was also associated with greater insulin sensitivity and lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Furthermore, we found that the number of ER22/23EK carriers was signif- icantly higher in the older half of the sample, suggesting that the polymorphism had a beneficial effect on survival.

METHODS

Subjects

We recruited 402 men, aged 73 years or older, by a letter that was sent to the oldest men in Zoetermeer, The Neth- erlands. Subjects were eligible to participate if they were physically and mentally able to visit the study center in- dependently. No additional health-related criteria were used. Medications taken for more than 6 months were recorded. Data on vital status of the participants and causes of death during 4-year follow-up were obtained by contacting the participants’ general practitioners. Before the start of the study, which received the approval of the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Cen- ter, all subjects had given their written informed consent to participate.

The ER22/23EK variant might also affect the inflam- matory response, and elevated levels of two inflammatory markers—C-reactive protein and interleukin 6—are as- sociated with mortality in the elderly (3). C-reactive pro- tein is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events (4–7). Interleukin 6 stimulates the synthesis of C- reactive protein, as well as other acute phase proteins in

Measurements

This research project was supported by a grant from NWO and Re- search Institute of Diseases in the Elderly.

Weight and height were measured, and the body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated. Blood pressure was mea- sured in sitting position at the right upper arm with a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Total fat mass, trunk fat mass, and lean body mass were measured using dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Corp., Madison,

were not normally distributed, logarithmic transforma- tions were applied to normalize them or nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test) were used. Continuous - *éSpS variables are reported as mean SD or median with the interquartile range. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier procedure and log-rank test. To study the association between C-reactive protein levels and mortal- ity, C-reactive protein levels were divided in two groups (high vs. low, based on the median value). Cox propor- tional hazards models were used to analyze this relation, adjusting for genotype, diabetes, and health status. Cor- relations between C-reactive protein levels and parame- ters of body composition and cortisol levels were calcu- <0 lated using Spearman’s correlation. P 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Levels of total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were measured using stan- dard laboratory methods; LDL cholesterol levels were cal- culated. C-reactive protein was measured with a highly sensitive method using a latex-enhanced immunoephe- lometric assay on a BN II analyser (Dade Behring, Lied- erbach, Germany). Interleukin 6 was determined by a commercially available immulite assay (Diagnostic Prod- ucts Corporation, Los Angeles, California), using ali- quots of undiluted sera tested against an absolute inter- leukin 6 standard preparation. Based on these standard curves, the concentrations of interleukin 6 were calcu- lated by the software provided. Cortisol was measured using a radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic System Labora- tories, Webster, Texas).

RESULTS

Lower extremity function or physical performance was assessed with measurements of standing balance, walking speed, and ability to rise from a chair (13). A summary performance scale, which ranged from 0 (worst) to 12 (best), was created by summing these scores. Satisfaction in performing activities of daily living was assessed by using a self-administered questionnaire (14). All items are evaluated on a 4-point scale; higher scores denote greater impairment.

Of the 402 men, 21 (5%) were heterozygous for the ER22/ 23EK polymorphism. No homozygotes were found. There were no significant differences in age, smoking sta- tus, measures of body composition, or lipids between the carriers and noncarriers (Table).

Mortality

Of the 381 noncarriers, 73 (19%) died during the 4 years of follow-up, while none of the 21 ER22/23EK carriers > = ( had died (Figure, P 0.03). Causes of mortality included     cardiovascular disease (40%, n 29), cancer (11%, n oa a 8), pneumonia (7%, n 5), cerebrovascular accident = (5%, n 4), miscellaneous (cachexia, infections, pulmo-    nary emphysema: 7%, n 5), and unknown (30%, n 22). Men with lower C-reactive protein levels (less than the median) had significantly better survival (13% [27/ 201] died) than those with higher C-reactive protein lev-  els (24% [47/201] died; hazard ratio 1.8; 95% confi- dence interval: 1.1 to 2.9). Additional analyses that adjusted for genotype, diabetes, or general health status (as physical performance, activities of daily life scores, and morbidity data) did not change these results.

At baseline, a 21-item medical history was obtained by a structured questionnaire, according to the following groups: musculoskeletal impairments (including arthri- tis and fractures); cardiovascular impairments (including symptoms or treatment of angina pectoris, heart failure, hypertension, arrythmia, myocardial infarction, cerebro- vascular accident, and shortness of breath); prostate problems (hyperplasia and cancer); other malignancies; endocrine disorders (diabetes mellitus and thyroid dis- ease); and other conditions (dizziness and disturbed vi- sion that impair mobility). A physical examination was performed. None of the participants was being treated for systemic infectious, inflammatory, or malignant disor- ders at the time of enrollment.

Anthropometric, Metabolic, and Parameters in ER22/23EK Carriers and Noncarriers

Glucocorticoid receptor genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (15). For confirmation, we reanalyzed all 21 heterozygous samples and 10 wild-type samples, and found identical genotypes.

ER22/23EK carriers had significantly lower C-reactive protein levels than noncarriers (Table). Lean body mass tended to be higher in ER22/23EK carriers compared with noncarriers; however, this did not reach statistical significance after correction for height. C-reactive pro- tein levels correlated significantly with body mass index (r = ( 0.16, P  0.002), total fat mass (r  0.15, P  0.003), = | wee and trunk fat mass (r 0.16, P 0.001), but not with  aM?> = | lean body mass (r 0.02, P 0.63). Early morning cor- tisol levels did not correlate with C-reactive protein levels    (r 0.04, P 0.48) or genotype (P 0.81).

Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows, release 10.1 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois). Differences between the ER22/ 23EK carriers and the noncarriers were adjusted for age and, if necessary, for body mass index or smoking and tested by analysis of covariance using the general linear model procedure. Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to adjust for multiple comparisons. If dependent variables

effects of glucocorticoids, and have lower fasting insulin and cholesterol levels (2). Perhaps the lower C-reactive protein levels we observed in ER22/23EK carriers are re- lated to, and possibly even due to, having less atheroscle- rosis.

We found no differences in body mass index, blood pressure, or levels of HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or interleukin 6 between ER22/23EK carriers and noncarri- ers (Table).

Greater body mass index, and fat mass in particular, are related to higher levels of interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (18–22). We found that C-reactive protein level correlated positively with body mass index and fat mass in these elderly men, but there was no association be- tween interleukin 6 and these parameters. We did not observe differences in body mass index or fat mass by genotype. ER22/23EK carriers had a slightly (but not sig- nificantly) higher lean body mass. We hypothesize that a greater lean body mass, which might also result in greater insulin sensitivity, may also be a factor in the better car- diovascular health status of ER22/23EK carriers, thereby contributing to lower C-reactive protein levels. In an- other study, we found associations of the ER22/23EK polymorphism with body composition in young adults, specifically in male carriers aged 36 years with an average of 5 kg more lean mass and in female carriers with ten- dencies towards less fat mass. Muscle mass is an impor-

DISCUSSION

In this population-based study involving elderly men, we found that carriers of the ER22/23EK polymorphism of the glucorticoid receptor gene had better 4-year survival. This is in line with our previous findings (2), in which we observed that the proportion of ER22/23EK carriers was significantly greater in the older half of the study sample. The ER22/23EK carriers also had significantly lower C- reactive protein levels, but no association was found with anthropometric parameters or interleukin 6 levels. Since C-reactive protein level predicts total and cardiovascular mortality in the elderly (16), it might underlie the effect of the ER22/23EK polymorphism on survival. However, it is unclear whether C-reactive protein is a cause of athero- sclerosis or whether it reflects the degree of vascular dam- age (17). We previously demonstrated that carriers of the ER22/23EK polymorphism are relatively resistant to the

Thus, the association between ER22/23EK polymor- phism and mortality might be due to factors other than C-reactive protein. We reported an association between the ER22/23EK polymorphism and greater insulin sensi- tivity, as well as lower total and LDL cholesterol levels in a population-based sample that had a mean age of 67 years. Although we observed a similar pattern in the present study, we did not find statistically significant differences in cholesterol levels, perhaps because the mean age in the current study was more than 10 years older; selection of surviving participants with relatively low cholesterol lev- els may have occurred.

In this study, and in our previous study (2), there was no correlation between ER22/23EK polymorphism and early morning cortisol levels. However, we previously re- ported that the carrier genotype is associated with glu- cocorticoid resistance, as manifest by a decreased re- sponse to the dexamethasone suppression test (2). These data suggest that there may be beneficial metabolic ef- fects, resulting in better survival, due to subtle lifelong glucocorticoid resistance. In the present study, we found that the ER22/23EK polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene was associated with lower C-reactive pro- tein levels and better survival in elderly men.

tant determinant of insulin sensitivity and can thus con- tribute to a better metabolic profile. We believe that body composition could play an important role in the relation of the ER22/23EK polymorphism with both survival and C-reactive protein levels.

Interleukin 6 is a potent stimulator of C-reactive pro- tein in the liver and acts synergistically with glucocorti- coids to induce the synthesis of other acute phase proteins by the liver. In addition, glucocorticoids inhibit the pro- duction of interleukin 6 when administered in pharma- cological amounts or when present at high levels (23,24). However, in physiological circumstances, the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids on interleukin 6 is minor or even absent (23). The variation in basal cortisol levels in carri- ers and noncarriers of the ER22/23EK polymorphism is likely to be within the physiological range because corti- sol levels did not differ significantly by genotype. How- ever, in general, the biological response of a target cell to a hormone is determined by several factors, including the concentration of the hormone, the concentration of re- ceptors, and the affinity of the hormone-receptor inter- action. For example, glucocorticoids also upregulate the interleukin 6 receptor (25), by which they can influence the biological effects of interleukin 6. The ER22/23EK polymorphism, which is associated with relative resis- tance to the effects of glucocorticoids, might result in a lesser degree of upregulation of the interleukin 6 recep- tor. Thus, although there were no differences in circulat- ing interleukin 6 concentrations, the ER22/23EK poly- morphism might result in a decreased stimulation of C-reactive protein production.
