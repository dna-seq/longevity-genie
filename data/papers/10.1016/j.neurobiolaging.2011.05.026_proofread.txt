Abstract

Human longevity and healthy aging show moderate heritability (20%50%). We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from 9 studies from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium for 2 outcomes: (1) all-cause mortality, and (2) survival free of major disease or death. No single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was a genome-wide significant predictor of either outcome (p << 5 x 10^-8). We found 14 independent SNPs that predicted risk of death, and 8 SNPs that predicted event-free survival (p < |10^-5). These SNPs are in or near genes that are highly expressed in the brain (HECW2, HIP1, BIN2, GRIA1), genes involved in neural development and function (KCNQ4, LMO4, GRIA1, NETO1) and autophagy (ATG4C), and genes that are associated with risk of various diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In addition to considerable overlap between the traits, pathway8.8 (SD 5.7) years, and we registered 7314 major events. Frailty and survival free of disease have been suggested as more promising phenotypes for studies of aging because mortality is a very heterogeneous outcome caused by multiple chronic conditions (Vijg and Suh, 2005). We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) associated with all-cause mortality (time to death) in a hypothesis-free GWAS in approximately 25,000 unselected persons of European ancestry. We also performed GWAS of time to event, defined by major incident events (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, dementia, hip fracture, or cancer) or death, as an alternative phenotype for healthy aging. Finally, we analyzed the SNPs along with their respective most likely associated genes identified in the GWAS meta-analyses to identify pathways and networks associated with aging and longevity.

As different genotyping platforms were used across studies, we imputed to 2.5 million SNPs using the HapMap 22 CEU (Build 36) genotyped samples as a reference. We used the semiparametric Cox proportional hazard to model time to event for both phenotypes in each study. Follow-up time since baseline was used as time scale. An additive genetic model was used in this analysis. We subsequently combined the individual study results in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model that combined the study-specific regression parameters and standard errors using inverse variance weighting.

We included SNPs that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 1% and an imputation quality ratio (de Bakker et al., 2008) (equivalent to the MaCH r2 statistic; Li et al., 2009b) of at least 0.3. The study-specific inflation factors were computed using GC the set of chi-square statistics used for the meta-analysis for each study. The inflation factor is computed as the median of all chi-square statistics divided by the expected median of the statistics (approximately 0.456) for a chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom. SNP associations at p < 5 x 10^-8 were considered to be genome-wide significant. SNPs with p < 5 x 10^-5 were considered suggestive associations. The combined meta-analysis hazard ratio (HR) can be interpreted as the increase in the risk of dying or having a major event during follow-up per additional copy of the coded allele. Power analysis revealed 80% statistical power to detect SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 5% and relative risk of 1.10 using a nominal significance level of 0.05.

The participants stem from cohorts of the CHARGE Consortium (Psaty et al., 2009). All cohorts are follow-up studies periodically assessing the health and vital status of their participants. Although some of the cohorts included multiple ethnic groups, only data from self-reported Caucasians were used. In addition, population structure was assessed using principal components in each CHARGE study, and outliers were removed. Any remaining within-study structure was adjusted for using appropriate methods (Price et al., 2006). All participants included in this analysis were at least 55 years of age at the time of blood draw for DNA and provided written informed consent.

We conducted a survival analysis, adjusted for age at baseline and sex, to model continuous time to death or end of follow-up in 25,007 participants (deceased cases n=8444; mean follow-up time 10.6 [SD 5.4] years) that were older than 55 years at baseline. As research demonstrated that the likelihood of incident disease is genetically determined, we defined a second phenotype: survival free of major disease or mortality (Atzmon et al., 2004; Lunetta et al., 2007; Vijg and Suh, 2005). The outcome was defined as time to the first of the following adjudicated events: myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, dementia, hip fracture, cancer, or death. For this analysis, participants at baseline were older than 55 years of age and free of any of the aforementioned conditions. Inclusion in the study required complete follow-up information on mortality.

In addition, we incorporated gene annotation information, a technique that has successfully been applied in the field of aging research (de Magalhaes et al., 2009a, 2010). Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER; Mi et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2003) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (www.ingenuity.com) were used for identification and classification of networks, pathways, biological processes, and molecular functions of the genes identified in this study. For both phenotypes, we generated lists of candidate genes. These genes were the closest referenceA nominally significant level of p 0.05 was observed across all replication samples (Supplementary Tables S5-S8). In the combined meta-analysis of the discovery and replication studies, only rs1425609 in the vicinity of otolin-1 (OTOL1) showed a stronger association (1.61 x 10^-6). Likewise, no genome-wide significant findings were identified in the time-to-event analysis, which included 16,995 participants free of disease at baseline and registering 7314 events over an average of 8.8 (SD 5.7) years of follow-up (Table 2). Events included incident myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, dementia, hip fracture, cancer, or any death. The Q-Q plot (Fig. 1a, 1.019) showed no evidence of inflation of type I error due to genomic control. In total, eight independent SNPs were associated with event-free survival at a threshold of p < 10^-5. The SNP with the strongest association was rs10412199 (chromosome 19, p = 3.02 x 10^-6), which is in close proximity to ataxia, cerebellar, Cayman type (AT-CAY). Additional descriptive information including definitions of each event and association results with p < 10^-4 are provided in Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Tables S9-S12.

Fig. 1 shows quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots after meta-analysis for time to death and time to event. The overlap between their association results is presented in Table 3. Interpretation of the overlap between the phenotypes requires caution as both phenotypes are correlated; nevertheless, it helps to focus on specific loci and put them into the context of aging. From the 14 loci passing the prespecified suggestive threshold of p < 1 x 10^-5 in the time to death analysis, five had corresponding SNPs within 500 kilobase pairs distance, in linkage disequilibrium (LD; r^2 > 0.1) associated with p < 1 x 10^-4 and the same overall direction of effect in the time to event analysis. These five regions were in the vicinity of the following genes: OTOL1 (3q26.1), bridging integrator 2 (BIN2, 12q13), ATG4 autophagy-related 4 homolog C (ATG4C, 1p31.3), origin recognition complex subunit 5-like (ORC5L, 7q22.1), and potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 4 (KCNQ4, 1p34). Similarly, in the time to event analysis, three of the eight top SNPs showed considerable overlap and the same direction of effect as those in the time to death analysis. These SNPs were close to the following genes: MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus (MECOM, 3q24-q28), succinate-CoA ligase, ADP-forming, beta subunit (SUCLA2, 13q12.2-q13.3), and ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3 (ST3GAL3, 1p34.1).

Table 1 shows the top 14 SNPs (p-value < 10^-5) for time to death ranked by p-value from meta-analysis of nine cohorts. Only SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 3% are presented. p-values are for the inverse variance-weighted for NCBI Build 36. HRs are for each additional coded allele. The number of supporting SNPs is the number of SNPs within 500 kilobase pairs of CEU release 22 (r^2 > 0.10) and have association p-value < 0.05. Key: Chr, chromosome; LD, linkage disequilibrium; MAF, minor allele frequency; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. For information on all SNP associations with p-value < 10^-4, see Supplementary Table S2. Study-specific information is presented in the order: RS, CHS, FHS, ARIC, AGES, HABC, BLSA, InCHIANTI, SHIP; coded allele of mortality, not tested. 

Table 2 shows the number of participants and events by cohort in the time-to-event analysis. The total number of participants was 16,995 with 7314 events over an average of 8.8 years of follow-up.

Table 3 presents the overlap between association results for time to death and time to event analysis. The number of SNPs with p < 0.05 in both analyses is shown for each gene regionFinally, we evaluated candidate genes for aging by identification and classification of networks, pathways, biological processes, and molecular functions. The candidate genes were derived from the meta-analyses of GWAS and included the reference genes closest to the SNPs associated with p < 1 x 10^-3 (time to death: 862 genes, time to event: 704 genes). We used PANTHER (Mi et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2003, 2006) and IPA software (www.ingenuity.com) for these analyses. PANTHER compares these gene lists to the reference list using the binomial test for each molecular function, biological process, or pathway term. IPA builds networks by searching the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base for interactions between the identified genes and all other gene objects stored in the knowledge base.

The biological processes overrepresented in the PANTHER analysis were developmental processes, neuronal activities, signal transduction, neurogenesis, ectoderm development, and cell adhesion. For the analysis of time to incident event, developmental processes and neuronal activities were overrepresented among other biological processes (Table 4). The analyses also highlighted the Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway is ubiquitous and known to be involved in cancer but also plays an important role in the early stages of the development of the central nervous system, in synaptic formation by axon guidance, and in modulating fibrosis during muscle repair scored high in both traits under study (Brack et al., 2007; Inestrosa and Arenas, 2010; Keeble et al., 2006; Ulloa and Martínez-Martínez, 2010). For extended tables see Supplementary Tables S13 and S14. 

In addition, Ingenuity identified 1 network with p < 1 x 10^-31 containing 26 genes involved in processes related to nervous system development and function for the analysis of time to death (Fig. 2) and 1 network with p < 1 x 10^-40 containing 28 genes involved in cellular function and development for time to event (Supplementary Fig. S3). IPA analysis highlighted the following genes associated with the time to death trait: NTRK2 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2) a member of the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase family. This kinase is a membrane-bound receptor that, upon neurotrophin binding, phosphorylates itself and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Signaling through this kinase leads to cell differentiation.

2013], GRIA1), or have been implicated in neurological disorders (BIN2 [Chapuis et al., 2013], NCAM1 [Kulahin et al., 2011], NTRK2 [Klein et al., 2011]). However, further research is needed to confirm the potential role of these genes in human aging and longevity.

One possible limitation of our study is the focus on common genetic variants, which may not capture the effects of low frequency and rare variants or structural variations. Additionally, phenotypic heterogeneity across different cohorts may have limited our ability to identify true effects. Nevertheless, our study highlights the potential contribution of genes related to neural regulation, cellular and neural development and function, and cell communication to variation in human aging.

In conclusion, our genome-wide association study of all-cause mortality and survival free of major diseases did not identify any genome-wide significant associations but highlighted several loci with suggestive significance near genes related to neural regulation. Pathway and network analyses also identified an enrichment of genes associated with cellular and neural development and function, and cell communication that may contribute to variation in human aging. Future studies incorporating low frequency and rare variants, as well as larger sample sizes with more homogeneous populations, may help to further elucidate the genetic basis of human aging and longevity.2009; Leuba et al., 2004], GRIA1), and the maintenance of neural circuitry and synaptic plasticity (NETO1), or are associated with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (LMO4 [Leuba et al., 2004], BIN2, GRIA1, GRIN2B), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (GRIN2B). In addition, 6 of the 22 SNPs were in close proximity to genes associated with other aging phenotypes such as autophagy (ATG4C [Kenyon, 2010]), cancer (ATG4C [Maiuri et al., 2009], HIP1 [Bradley et al., 2007], HECW2 [Rotin and Kumar, 2009], VWA5A [Zhou et al., 2009], MECOM), and mitochondrial depletion syndrome (SUCLA2). Notably, BIN2, ATG4C, KCNQ4, MECOM, and SUCLA2 showed associations with both traits in our study. Few or none of the top hits from the GWAS were involved in common pathways of aging, typically addressed in candidate gene studies. For example, there was no specific evidence for genes involved in IGF-insulin signaling. However, this negative finding cannot be interpreted as evidence against the importance of IGF-insulin signaling, as well as other processes such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cellular damage and repair, growth hormone, and cell proliferation in aging. Moreover, it is possible that polymorphisms in related genes have an effect in the oldest old, who were represented by fewer numbers in our study population such that our study design would be underpowered to detect it. It is also conceivable that the neurological pathways identified by our analysis interact with the known candidate genes involved in aging (Bishop et al., 2010; Finch and Ruvkun, 2001). It is feasible that the traditional aging pathways are hierarchically controlled by neurons and that the brain might be the location coordinating physiological changes (Bishop et al., 2010; Finch and Ruvkun, 2001). Because neurons are particularly susceptible to damage caused by reactive oxygen species, limitations in cellular maintenance and repair might reinforce these pathways and accelerate aging (Finch and Ruvkun, 2001). An increased ability of neuronal cells to prevent or repair oxidative damage might result in beneficial hormonal signaling, otherwise deregulated with age, thus delaying the onset of age-related disease and directly regulating cognitive aging and life span (Bishop et al., 2010; Cutler and Mattson, 2006; de Magalhaes and Sandberg, 2005). Using the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) browser (eqtl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/eqtl/), we detected eQTL associated with HIP1, COL5A1, LOC340156, and SMARCA2 in time to death only. Interestingly, SNPs known to be associated with longevity and disease in the neighborhood of APOE (Deelen et al., 2011) or FOXO3A (Flachsbart et al., 2009; Willcox et al., 2008) only reached nominal significance (results not shown). These genes were originally identified in studies of centenarians; it is possible that our study of cohorts comprised of individuals from the general populations did not have sufficient statistical power to identify these genes with certainty. (Tan et al., 2008). While meta-analysis of GWAS has the power to detect small changes of allele frequencies between groups with the analyzed trait, true association signals may not be revealed based on a stringent genome-wide significance threshold. This situation, although limiting false positive findings, performs poorly in identifying false negatives as they may fall below the threshold. Network analyses using a less stringent significance threshold do not amend the overall negative finding of this study. However, it is well-recognized that within the many associations that failed to attain this level of significance lie true positive associations. Network analyses can provide useful information exploring multiple gene effects and their interactions. In conclusion, our analysis did provide suggestive evidence that aging is under neuronal control. Unfortunately, we have no relevant tissue or expression experiment available to further underscore or validate our findings. Future investigations of changes of gene expression with age at cellular and population levels are warranted. In fact, the interpretation of most GWAS results is difficult because individual results may involve many seemingly unrelated genes. Because PANTHER and IPA are built on different conceptual approaches, database sources, and different pathway classifications, they can be seen as complementary approaches. Our pathway and network analyses highlighted neuronal activities and organism developmental processes as major biological processes involved in aging. In addition, it highlighted Wnt signaling and showed that those involved in this pathway are related to age-related diseases and longevity.Study was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institute on Aging; R01 AR/AG 41398.
