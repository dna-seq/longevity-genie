Abstract

The SIR2/Sirt1 gene has been demonstrated as regulating lifespan in many model organisms, including yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and rodents. These findings render the human homologue, SIRT1, a very plausible candidate as a modifier of human life expectancy. We therefore sought to investigate whether common allelic variation in the SIRT1 gene was associated with human longevity. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), distributed across the entire gene, including the promoter region, were genotyped in our extensive DNA collections of 1573 long-lived individuals (centenarians and nonagenarians) and matched younger controls. Four of the markers were haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) that defined five common haplotypes. No evidence for an association was detected between any of the tested SNPs and the longevity phenotype at the allele, genotype or haplotype levels. These findings, based on an htSNP approach, suggest that there is no noteworthy influence of SIRT1 sequence variation on exceptional human longevity in the German population. However, this does not rule out the possibility that allelic variants in direct regulators or downstream substrates of SIRT1 could play critical roles in extending lifespan in humans. q 2005 Elsevier Inc.

(CR) have also been seen in more complex species, ranging from C. elegans to mammals (Masoro, 2000). Based on these observations, it has been suggested that the evolutionarily conserved SIR2 genes could play a similar role as modulators of lifespan in higher organisms (Guarente, 2000; Hekimi and Guarente, 2003).

1. Introduction

The yeast SIR2 (silent mating type information regulator 2) gene was the first described member of a large gene family that encodes NADC -dependent protein deacetylases. These enzymes are involved in gene silencing, chromatin structure, DNA repair, and control of cellular survival (Guarente, 2000). Expression of extra copies of SIR2 and the nematode homologue sir-2.1 increases lifespan in yeast (Kaeberlein et al., 1999) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001), respectively. The same effects—up-regu- lation of SIR2 with subsequent life extension—can also be achieved by exposing yeast cells to a low calorie diet (Lin et al., 2000). The life-prolonging effects of calorie restriction

‘sirtuins’ (Sirts), have been identified, of which Sirt1 is the most closely related to yeast SIR2 (Frye, 1999; 2000). There is indeed mounting evidence that the mammalian SIRT1 protein may also act as a potential modifier of longevity by slowing ageing during times of adversity. A recent study by Cohen et al. (2004) demonstrated that various tissues from rats on CR had increased amounts of SIRT1 protein compared to animals on a normal diet. The underlying mechanism leading to SIRT1 over-expression is still unknown but it may be mediated, in part, by the insulin-IGF1 signaling pathway (Cohen et al., 2004). SIRT1 protein upregulated through food withdrawal was found to bind and repress the fat regulator PPAR-gamma in murine adipocytes, thus stimulating fat breakdown (Picard et al., 2004). Because murine lifespan can be extended by reducing fat stores, these results suggest that activation of

SIRT1 mediation by energy restriction could be a possible molecular mechanism of mammalian lifespan regulation (Picard et al., 2004). Interestingly, plant-derived polyphenols, such as the red-grape component resveratrol, induce SIR2/ SIRT1 gene activation and mimic the effects of CR in yeast, Drosophila and in human embryonic kidney 293 cell cultures

gene is associated with exceptional longevity in humans. To this end, we have analyzed five known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which capture the majority of the variation in the SIRT1 gene via its common haplotypes, in our extensive collection of 1573 long-lived individuals (centenar- ians and nonagenarians) and appropriately matched younger controls.

In response to CR, radiation or oxidative stress, increased SIRT1 activity has also been shown to reduce p53-, Bax- or forkhead-dependent apoptosis (Luo et al., 2001; Vaziri et al., 2001; Brunet et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2004; Motta et al., 2004; Nemoto et al., 2004). A strong association has been reported between ageing and enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis (Higami and Shimokawa, 2000; Pollack et al., 2002). The SIRT1-mediated resistance to apoptosis may therefore promote long-term cell survival and mitigate the age-related progressive erosion of cells, tissues and organs. More recent findings in mouse embryonic fibroblasts have revealed an additional SIRT1 function in handling chronic cellular stress: the protein triggers replicative senescence (Chua et al., 2005). This role is in marked contrast to that reported for yeast cells where SIR2p promotes cell division. However, the ability of SIRT1 to induce permanent cell cycle arrest is only triggered by chronic, but not acute, genotoxic stress (Chua et al., 2005). Further work is needed to elucidate how the mammalian SIRT1 helps cells respond to adverse conditions and how this mechanism influences the ageing process.

2. Subjects and methods

2.1. Subjects

A total sample of 1026 unrelated German long-lived individuals (LLI) was studied. All individuals were between 95 and 109 years of age at the time of recruitment (mean age: 98.3 years). These included 386 centenarians and super- centenarians (mean age: 101.0 years). The gender ratio in the sample was 74% females vs. 26% males. The 547 German control subjects were between 60 and 75 years of age (mean age: 67.2 years) and matched the long-lived individuals by gender, ethnical ancestry and geographical origin within the country. A detailed description of the samples and the recruitment procedure is given in Nebel et al. (2005). All subjects gave informed, written consent prior to participation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel and by the local data protection authorities.

The human SIR2 homologue SIRT3, which encodes a mitochondrial protein (Onyango et al., 2002), has previously been subject to a longevity association study in Italians from Calabria (Rose et al., 2003). By analyzing the genotype- specific survival function, an association between a silent mutation in the coding region of SIRT3 and survivorship was detected, albeit only in males. This finding suggests that variation in SIRT3 itself, or in a gene that is tightly linked to it, may modulate life expectancy in humans (Rose et al., 2003).

2.2. SNP genotyping

DNA samples from long-lived individuals and control subjects were analyzed for five SNPs located in the SIRT1 gene (Table 1) using the Taqman Allelic Discrimination method (Applied Biosystems) on an automated platform as previously described (Hampe et al., 2001a,b). Details about the assay designs are available from http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/. HapMap data (http://www.hapmap.org/) revealed that the entire SIRT1 gene is within a 151-kb region of strong linkage disequilibrium (an ‘LD block’). Such LD blocks are typically characterized by a few (2–4) common haplotypes that capture

The life-prolonging effects that the SIR2 gene and its homologues exert on various model organisms, together with the association finding in the human SIRT3 gene, prompted us to investigate whether common allelic variation in the SIRT1

the majority (typicallyO90%) of the genetic variation present within the LD block (Daly et al., 2001). Consequently, by selecting five markers of varying minor allele frequency that are spread across the SIRT1 region we could be fairly confident of capturing the common haplotypes and the majority of the genetic variation.The tested polymorphisms are spacedacrossthe coding 0 region, the 3 UTR and the promoter of the gene (Table 1). By means of the ‘First Exon and Promoter Prediction Program for Human DNA’ (http://rulai.cshl.org/tools/FirstEF/) the promoter of the SIRT1 gene was localized within the genomic sequence NM_012238 to between about 500 and 1000 bp downstream of hCV3003909, i.e. the promoter lies between the two markers hCV3003909 and hCV11642237.

As expected, the five SNPs comprised a single LD block with high levels of LD between all the markers. The pairwise 0 D values ranged from 0.92 to 1.00. The five SNPs defined five haplotypes with a frequencyO1% in the control population and with the three most frequent haplotypes accounting for 92% of the data (Table 2). Four of the markers were haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the sense that they were sufficient to resolve the five haplotypes. In other words, markers hCV3003909 and hCV11642237 were in perfect LD and redundant with respect to each other such that either could be used in conjunction with the other markers to reconstruct the haplotypes and their frequencies. None of the five-SNP haplotypes differed significantly in frequency between the case samples and the controls. Neither did testing of two-, three- and four-SNP haplotypes in a sliding window across the gene reveal any statistically significant frequency differences (data not shown).

2.3. Statistical analysis

Single marker case–control analyses on allele and genotype frequency data were performed using contingency table c2 statistics at the appropriate degrees of freedom using the Web- based Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis (SISA) tool, available from http://home.clara.net/sisa. The software program Haploview, version 3.2 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haplo- view/) was used to assess all polymorphisms for significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, to calculate LD 0 (D ) between each marker pair and to visualize haplotype structure (Barrett et al., 2005). Haplotype frequencies were inferred using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the sliding window option as implemented in the program COCAPHASE, version 2.403 which is part of the UNPHASED suite (http://portal.litbio.org/; Dudbridge, 2003). COCAPHASE was also used to evaluate the statistical significance of haplotype frequency differences between cases and controls.

4. Discussion

The SIR2/Sirt1 gene has been shown to regulate lifespan in many model organisms, including yeast, C. elegans and rodents (Hekimi and Guarente, 2003). In mammals, expression of the SIRT1 protein is activated by various stress stimuli, leading to a break-down of fat stores, induction of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair processes, or attenuation of apoptosis (Brunet et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2004; Nemoto et al., 2004; Picard et al., 2004; Chua et al., 2005). Under adverse circumstances, SIRT1 appears to increase organismal longevity by tipping physiological responses away from cell death and towards cellular stress resistance (Brunet et al., 2004). As effective stress resistance is frequently correlated with extended lifespan in lower eukaryotes, the ability of SIRT1 to modulate reactions to stress in mammalian cells also suggests a potential link between the gene and longevity in mammals (Chua et al., 2005), and therefore possibly humans.

3. Results

The entire collection of 1026 German LLI and the sub-set of 386 centenarians were subjected to a gender-matched case–control analysis of five SNPs in the SIRT1 gene. All SNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the cases and controls. No evidence for an association was detected between any of the tested SNPs and the longevity phenotype in either sample, neither at the allele nor at the genotype level

We therefore sought to determine whether common allelic variation in the SIRT1 gene was associated with longevity in humans. Five SNPs, four of which are haplotype-tagging, were selected from the public databases and genotyped in our extensive DNA collection of more than 1500 long-lived

The htSNP approach employed here is likely to have captured the common variation present in the SIRT1 genomic region for the samples analyzed in this study. By tagging the common variation (haplotypes) within SIRT1 we implicitly assume that any undetected rare variants will be carried by one or other of the common background haplotypes and hence be statistically detectable; this is the logic of the htSNP approach. It is of course possible, albeit unlikely, that the selected markers might not tag the common variation comprehensively, and that rare SIRT1 polymorphisms, with a weak impact on the longevity phenotype, may exist. Overall however, our findings would suggest that there is no noteworthy influence of SIRT1 gene variation on exceptional human longevity in the German population. The possibility that this negative association finding results from population stratification in our samples is unlikely. The validity and efficacy of our extensive study population for genetic longevity research have recently been demonstrated (Nebel et al., 2005).

The conserved function of SIRT1 in invertebrates and mammals predicts that the up-regulation of the SIRT1 gene and the subsequent increase in levels of the SIRT1 protein would also exert a life-prolonging effect in humans. In this case, potential mutations affecting the transcription of the gene would be of particular interest. Because the htSNPs used in this study, which are in strong LD, also span the promoter of SIRT1, a significant influence of variation in this regulatory region of the gene may be excluded. However, it is possible that allelic variants in direct modulators of SIRT1 may be crucial in regulating SIRT1 protein levels. In addition, variation in the broad array of SIRT1 downstream targets could also play critical roles in extending lifespan.

In this study, we have demonstrated that common SIRT1 variation does not appear to be associated with exceptional human longevity, despite the fact that the gene is considered an important player in pathways that modulate lifespan in a wide range of organisms, and possibly also in humans.
