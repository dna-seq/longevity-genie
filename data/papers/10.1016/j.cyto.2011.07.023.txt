Aging is a complex phenotype with multiple determinants but a strong genetic component impacts on survival to extreme ages. The dysregulation of immune responses occurring with age is believed to contribute to human morbidity and mortality. Conversely, some genetic of successful aging might reside in those polymorphisms for the immune system genes immune responses. Here we examined the main effects of single loci and multi-locus interactions to the hypothesis that the adenosine deaminase (ADA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) genes influence human life-expectancy. ADA (22G>A, rs73598374) and TNF-a ((cid:2)308G>A, rs1800629; rs361525) functional SNPs have been determined for 1071 unrelated healthy individuals from Italy (18–106 years old) divided into three gender-specific age classes defined according to information and accounting for the different survivals between sexes: for men (women), the first consists of individuals <66 years old (<73 years old), the second class of individuals 66–88 years (73–91 years old), and the third class of individuals > 88 years old (>91 years old). Single-locus showed that only ADA 22G>A is significantly associated with human life-expectancy in males ison 1 (age class 2 vs. age class 1), O.R. 1.943, P = 0.036; comparison 2 (age class 3 vs. age class 2), 0.320, P = 0.0056). Age- and gender-specific patterns of epistasis between ADA and TNF-a were using Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR). In comparison 1, a significant interaction occurs in females between ADA 22G>A and TNF-a (cid:2)238G>A (Sign Test P = 0.011). In ison 2, both two-loci and three-loci interaction are significant associated with increased over 88 years in males. In conclusion, we report that a combination of functional SNPs within ADA and TNF-a genes can influence life-expectancy in a gender-specific manner and that males and females different pathways to attain longevity.

1. Introduction

The dysregulation of both immune and inflammatory responses occurring with increasing age is believed to substantially contrib- ute to morbidity and mortality in humans [2–4]. Conversely, hu- man longevity seems to be directly correlated with optimal functioning of the immune system [5], suggesting that some genet- ic determinants of successful ageing might reside in those poly- morphisms for the immune system genes that regulate immune responses [6]. In this context, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a, gene map locus 6p21.3, within the major histocompatibility complex class III region) is one of the most studied genes. It encodes for a pleiotropic cytokine playing a key role in both inflammation and chronic age related diseases. The TNF-a (cid:2)308G>A (rs1800629) Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) has received a particularly large amount of attention because of its putative effect on TNF-a expression. Some in vitro studies indicated

Human longevity is a complex trait arising from the interplay of environmental and genetic factors. The study of such phenotype gives us the opportunity to uncover the biological determinants of human survival and life-expectancy. In fact, most of the infor- mation regarding the genetics of human longevity has been ob- tained through retrospective studies, under the hypothesis that unfavorable genotypes should be dropped out of the population by a sort of ‘‘demographic selection’’ [1] which finally results in an enrichment of favorable genotypes in the gene pool of long living people.

population from 1890 onward (computed using death counts per calendar year and per year of birth as reported for the Italian pop- ulation in the Human Mortality Database, available online at www.mortality.org) [25]. The study protocol was approved by the Joint Ethical Committee (JEC) University of Camerino-Azienda ASUR Marche ZT-10 Camerino, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in its revised edition and with international and local regulatory requirements.

transcription activity compared to the G⁄/G⁄ genotype [7]. There- fore, many investigators have examined the contribution of the (cid:2)308G>A SNP in human longevity and age-related diseases [8,9]. However, while correlation between the TNF-a 308G>A SNP and age-related or autoimmune pathologies has been established [9], the association studies on human longevity have yield contrasting results [8,10–15]. Interestingly, the TNF-a gene expression seems to be influenced also by the (cid:2)238G>A SNP (rs361525) in its pro- moter region: carriers of hypomorphic TNF-a (cid:2)238⁄A allele display a reduced expression [16], thus eventually counteracting the effect of (cid:2)308G>A SNP.

2.2. ADA and TNFa SNPs genotyping

Given the pleiotropic nature of TNF-a and the complex regulating its expression and action [17], it is also conceivably potential interactions with other functional polymorphisms genes involved in the inflammatory pathway may modulate biological function. In this frame, adenosine deaminase (ADA, map locus 20q13.11) seems to be an excellent modifier gene TNF-a physiological actions. In fact, adenosine levels, which icantly exert a down-regulating action on TNF-a [18–20], are enced by ADA. Moreover, the ADA gene displays a G>A transition nucleotide 22 of exon 1 leading to an Asp (allele 1⁄) to Asn 2⁄) amino acid substitution at position 8 of the mature which influences ADA activity. Thus, ADA 22⁄A is (cid:3)35% lower that of the ADA 22⁄G allele [21] and consequently, carriers of 22⁄A allele show a higher level of both circulating and adenosine. Recently, we have found a very significant of ADA 22⁄A with TNF-a (cid:2)308⁄A allele in males aged >50 (O.R. = 5.16, P = 0.001) further suggesting a potential between these two genes [22]. It is also noteworthy that and TNF-a genetic polymorphisms were found associated human longevity only in males [8,23].

Genomic DNA extraction was carried out from peripheral blood through standardized salting-out method and DNA was stored at (cid:2)20 (cid:3)C until gene analysis.

ADA (22G>A) and TNF-a ((cid:2)308G>A; (cid:2)238G>A) SNPs were gen- otyped according to RFLP–PCR methods previously published [23,26]. Briefly, for ADA, PCR was performed with primers flanking the 22G>A polymorphic region: 50-GCCCGGCCCGTTAAGAAGAGC-30 as sense primer, and 50-GGTCAAGTCAGGGGCAGAAGCAGA-30 as antisense primer. The PCR products were digested with TaqI endo- nuclease for 90 min at 65 (cid:3)C, and the samples were electrophore- sed in a 1.8% agarose gel. The ADA 22⁄A allele was identified by the lack of a TaqI restriction site. For TNF-a SNPs, PCR was carried out using 50-GGGACACACAAGCATCAAGG-30 and 50-ATCTGGAGGAA GCGGTAGTG-30 as primers sense and 50-AATAGGTTTTGAGGGCC ATG-30, 50-AGAAGACCCCCCTCGGAACC-30 as primers antisense for (cid:2)308G>A and (cid:2)238G>A, respectively. The PCR products were digested 90 min at 37 (cid:3)C with NcoI to detect the TNF-a (cid:2)308⁄A allele and with MspI to detect the TNF-a (cid:2)238⁄A allele following electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel.

2.3. Statistical analysis

The present study was thus undertaken: to replicate and extend previous findings, by testing the association of TNF-a ((cid:2)308G>A; (cid:2)238G>A) and ADA (22G>A) singular SNPs and TNF-a ((cid:2)308G>A; (cid:2)238G>A) promoter diplotype with human longevity/survival. Finally, a gene–gene interaction analysis between TNF-a ((cid:2)308G>A; (cid:2)238G>A) and ADA (22G>A) SNPs was performed.

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested by comparing, using the v2 test, observed and expected frequencies of the various genotypes. A dominant genetic model (G⁄/G⁄ vs. carriers of A⁄) was applied to test the genotypic association of singular SNPs with life-expectancy between the age classes. The differences in geno- types distributions between the groups were evaluated by the Fisher’s exact test and the results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.). Logistic regression mod- els were also performed using SPSS v.16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). TNF-a promoter diplotype association analysis was performed using UNPHASED [27]. Haploview v4.2 [28] was used to estimate the Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) among TNF-a promoter SNPs, both D0 and r2 were calculated separately in each gender-specific age class.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study subjects

males and 569 females), 18–106 years old, randomly recruited from the same geographical area of Central Italy (Marche region) on the eastern side of the Apennines. The whole population studied is composed of Caucasian individuals and is ethnically homoge- neous: this geographical area is characterized by low immigration rates and was settled by an ancient pre-Roman Italian population called the Piceni [24]. The same donors provided information concerning their health condition so as to ascertain that no patho- logical condition existed (e.g. cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension, obesity, and chronic inflammatory diseases). Subject’s age is self-reported. Almost all subjects were recruited in blood donor centres and through family physicians. The popula- tion under study was divided into three sex-specific age classes: for men (women), the first class consists of individuals <66 years old (<73 years old), the second class of individuals 66–88 years old (73–91 years old), and the third class of individuals >88 years old (>91 years old). These gender-specific age classes were defined according to demographic information and account for the different survivals of men and women in the Italian population. Briefly, the age classes ranging from 18 to 106 years were obtained on the basis of a synthetic survival curve con- structed using historic mortality data taken from the Italian

To test gene–gene interaction contributed by ADA (22G>A) and TNF-a ((cid:2)308G>A; (cid:2)238G>A) SNPs we applied the Generalized- Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) method (version 0.7) [29]. This method uses the same data-reduction strategy as the original MDR method [30], but score-based statistics using maximum-likelihood estimates is introduced to classify multifac- tor cells into two different groups [29]. Furthermore, the GMDR method, unlike the original MDR method [31], better handles data with unequal numbers of cases and controls, as occurs in our study. As in MDR, the best n-locus model is selected based on the highest training accuracy, and the maximum Balanced Testing Accuracy (TBA) and Cross Validation Consistency (CVC) are used to deter- mine the overall best epistasis model. TBA is calculated using the formula (sensitivity + specificity)/2 to yield an unbiased estimate for unbalanced case-control studies. Lastly, the v2 and sign tests determine whether the factors are significantly associated with the phenotype of interest. In particular, a significant v2 test reveals that the SNP or interaction between SNPs is associated with pheno- type tested, while a significant sign test suggests that the best

The haplotype association tests carried out on TNF-a promoter SNPs does not show any significant association with human-life expectancy (Table 2); considering age class 1, it is noteworthy that males show lower frequency of TNF-a (cid:2)308⁄G/(cid:2)238⁄A haplotype compared to females (4.5% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.082). Although LD analy- sis does not show any statistical significant D0 value, age classes 2 and 3 display higher D0 values compared to age classes 1, while r2 value is 0.00 in each age class (Table 2).

model with one or more SNPs is significantly better than the null model. Two-tail P values are reported. Bonferroni’s correction for multiple testing was not performed since we are assessing specific questions on genes previously tested for association with human longevity, and we are not searching for associations without a pri- ori hypotheses [32].

3. Results

3.2. Gene–gene interaction analysis

3.1. Association analyses

The genotype distributions of the three SNPs in the age classes are reported in Table 1. The genotype distributions are all in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium. Of the three SNPs studied, only the ADA 22G>A SNP is significantly associated with human life-expec- tancy in males (Table 1), considering each age class comparison (comparison 1, O.R. 1.943, P = 0.036; comparison 2, O.R. 0.320, P = 0.0056) or its genotype frequency distribution along the three age classes (v2 = 10.66, P = 0.0048). Logistic regression also con- firmed the results obtained through contingency tables (ADA males: comparison 1, b = (cid:2)0.637, P = 0.39; comparison 2, b = 1.145, P = 0.007). Of note, the frequency of ADA⁄22A carriers is significantly different between males and females in age class 1 (Males 11.1% vs. Females 22.5%, P = 0.0087).

Table 3 shows the results of GMDR analysis conducted on males and females separately considering the two comparison carried out between age classes. In comparison 1, a significant two-loci interaction occurs in females between ADA 22G>A and TNF-a (cid:2)238G>A SNPs, with a CVC of 10/10 and a TBA of 0.550 (Sign Test P = 0.011) (Table 3, Fig. 1). The odds ratio for this two-loci attribute constructed by GMDR is 1.584 (P = 0.022), while ADA 22G>A single locus attribute association does not reach statistical significance (O.R. = 1.471, P = 0.100). The three GMDR models obtained on males show a borderline non-signifi- cant gene–gene interaction (each model, Sign Test P = 0.055), although the derived attributes result significantly associated with enhanced life-expectancy (Table 3). Interestingly, as shown

differences reported for adenosine physiological effects, several considerations can be made:

in Fig. 1, males and females seem to display opposite gene–gene interactions for comparison 1, thus suggesting the existence of a gender-specific pathway determining increased life-expectancy after reproductive age (age class 1).

a- The effect of ADA

G>A is prominent in males, which display a greater sensibility to the effect of adenosine at vascular and immunological level [

]. Also, the beneficial role of estrogen hormone may underestimate the effect of adenosine in females [

]. Furthermore, the significant dif- ference of ADA

G>A genotype frequency between males and females could be ascribed to the presence of gender- dependent transmission ratio distortion [

,

]. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that ADA

G>A SNP is located within a C

island [

] which can be epigenetically imprinted [

]. Also, there is established evidence for a cru- cial role played by ADA in human reproduction [

], possibly influencing the selection before fertilization (meiotic drive), at the time of fertilization, and after fertilization (embryonic lethality). b- Males carriers of ADA⁄

A may have a selective advantage in reaching age class

, possibly due to the protective effect of the elevated cellular concentrations of adenosine during ischemic attack, whose occurrence drastically increases in this period of life. Moreover, ADA⁄

A has been recently associated with reduced risk of Coronary Artery Disease in males [

]. In this context, it is plausible that ADA⁄

A allele is responsible for increased myocardial adenosine concentrations which exert cardio-protective effects [

]. c- The significant decrease of ADA⁄

A carriers in age class

may be due to the striking impact of ADA gene on immune functions. Adenosine triggers the release of IL-

, a disability and mortality predictor among the elderly, as well as IL-

b, a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with poor physical performance and diminished muscle strength in older per- sons [

]. Adenosine also inhibits the activity of NK cells that it has been reported to play a crucial role in determining successful ageing and longevity [

]. Of note, ADA deficiency

For what concern comparison 2, both two-loci and three-loci interaction are significant associated in males with increased life- expectancy over 88 years (Table 3, Fig. 2), with ADA 22G>A/TNF-a (cid:2)308G>A interaction reporting the highest testing balanced accu- racy (TBA = 0.572, Sign Test P = 0.011, CVC = 10/10) and displaying an odds ratio of 2.061 (P = 0.0096). Females does not shown any significant gene–gene interaction or attribute association with in- creased life-expectancy (Table 3).

Finally, considering the combination of three SNPs studied, we have stratified the subjects studied into three groups based on ex- pected expression of TNF-a, low, normal and high expression, respectively (Table 4). Very interestingly, females show a signifi- cant higher frequency of ‘‘low TNF-a expression’’ gene combination compared to males in age class 1 (30.9% vs. 15.3%, P = 0.0031), while age classes 2 and 3 does not shown any significant gender- specific differences. Moreover, the comparison between age class 1 and age class 2 + 3 displays a significant association of ‘‘low TNF-a expression’’ with life-expectancy, with opposite gender-spe- cific effect (Males, O.R. = 1.704, P = 0.045; Females, O.R. = 0.639, P = 0.031) (Table 4).

4. Discussion

The main purpose of the present paper was to further our understanding on the role of ADA and TNF-a genes in the determi- nation of human life-expectancy. We report a significant main ef- fect of the ADA 22G>A SNP, especially in males, with a ‘‘biphasic’’ association with human life-expectancy. Given the established evi- dence for the functional effect of A⁄ variant (historically called ADA⁄2, characterized by a (cid:3)35% lower enzymatic activity com- pared to allele G⁄, or ADA⁄1), and considering the gender-specific

increases thymus apoptosis [44]. Thus, ADA⁄22A carriers may experience an increased immunological damage caused by more pronounced thymus involution compared to ADA G⁄/G⁄ homozygotes. Finally, it has been demonstrated that ADA inhibition accelerates the process of replicative senescence of CD8+ T lymphocytes, causing a reduction in overall proliferative potential, reduced telomerase activity, and blunted IL-2 gene transcription [45].

the majority of studies conducted to date [8,10–15], to our knowl- edge this is the first report on the association of TNF-a 238G>A SNP with life-expectancy.

Although either single-SNP and haplotype analysis of TNF-a gene did not yield any significant result, we detected an interest- ing gene–gene interaction between ADA and TNF-a, showing age- and sex-specific effects on life-expectancy. Of note, the epistasis between functional SNPs in ADA and TNF-a genes is also sup- ported by the established biological evidence that adenosine lev- els influence TNF-a expression [18–20]. In this respect, the opposite patterns of epistasis detected here between males and females in comparison 1 (Fig. 1) suggest that TNF-a levels exert

For what concern the TNF-a gene, our study failed to demon- strate an association of TNF-a (cid:2)308G>A and (cid:2)238G>A SNPs with human longevity. While for the former our results are in line with

different effects depending on gender. Indeed, while an expected ‘‘low TNF-a expression’’ genetic profile seems to be advantageous for male survival over 66 years, females display a deleterious ef- fect for carriers of ‘‘low TNF-a expression’’ profile. On the other side, while males show significant gene–gene interaction in age class comparison 2, the epistasis between ADA and TNF-a genes conveys towards a TNF-a expression genetic pattern very similar between the age classes compared and to related females age classes.

It is well established that TNF-a exerts gender-specific effects; it has been shown that endotoxin (LPS) stimulation of mononu- clear cells from men produced more TNF-a than cells from women [46]. Moreover, estrogen has been reported to suppress the release of TNF from macrophages after trauma-hemorrhage and to de- crease the susceptibility to subsequent sepsis [47], whereas endog- enous testosterone might increase pro-inflammatory cytokines following ischemia/reperfusion injury [48]. Thus, we may specu- late that the different patterns of association with life-expectancy detected in the present study may be related to the effect of TNF-a in influencing Th1/Th2 balance. In this context, the negative selec- tion of ‘‘low TNF-a expression’’ females in comparison 1 could be due to the occurrence of Th2 diseases such as asthma and allergy; it is also noteworthy that the mortality due to asthma among women is higher than men above the age of 65 only [49,50]. The deleterious effect of ‘‘high TNF-a expression’’ in males is sustained by the evidence for an increased TNF-a expression induction by testosterone and by an increased male liability to cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, the TNF-a (cid:2)308G>A SNP has been sug- gested to play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiac ischemic dam- age, a major causes of death more prevalent in men; in particular, (cid:2)308A⁄ carriers are prone to more severe ischemic damages following myocardial infarction [51].

In conclusion, the present study has shown that a combination of functional SNPs within ADA and TNF-a genes can influence life-expectancy in a gender-specific manner and that males and females follow different pathways to attain longevity. Moreover, our results are supported by the evidence that variability of genetic factors contributes to determine longevity in males much more than in females [25,52–55]. Remarkably, polymorphisms in IGF-1 [56], IL-6 [57,58], and IL-10 [12] genes were found to be associated with longevity in males but not in females.

Lastly, it is worth considering that in a such complex trait as human longevity, gene–gene interactions may play a crucial role. Recognition of the complexity of genetic architecture will be found by embracing the complexity of the genotype-to-phenotype mapping relationship that is likely to be characterized by nonlinear gene–gene interactions and other phenomena such as gene–environment interaction and locus heterogeneity.
