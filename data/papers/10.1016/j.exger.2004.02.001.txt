Abstract

The identification of immunogenetic longevity markers is a major area of molecular gerontological research. A number of genetic loci have been examined, e.g. the HLA and cytokine networks. This study investigated a genetic marker within the highly polymorphic KIR gene system with successful ageing in the Irish population. A 22 bp deletion was identified in the KIR2DS4 gene that predicts a truncated soluble KIR molecule with one intact Ig-like domain. The frequency of this variant was determined using a specific-primer PCR methodology. There was no observed association between this common polymorphic variation within this activatory KIR gene and the aged Irish population. This is the first study of KIR polymorphism in ageing and although no association was identified, the importance of the KIR network in the immune response and its polymorphic nature warrants more detailed analysis to ascertain its role in immunosenescence.

1. Introduction

elderly, an overall cytotoxic activity is maintained even though there are increased numbers of mature NK cells observed (Di Lorenzo et al., 1999; Solana et al., 1999; Miyaji et al., 2000). NK cells lyse abnormal cells that either lack the expression, or express diminished amounts, of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules. The ability of NK cells to discriminate between normal and HLA class I-deficient cells is due to the expression of clonally distri- buted HLA class I inhibitory receptors (Biassoni et al., 2000).

with optimal functioning of the immune system, suggesting that specific genetic determinants may reside in poly- morphic loci that regulate the immune response. Dysregula- tion of immune function accompanying ageing (immunosenescence) is postulated to contribute to morbid- ity and mortality in the aged via an increased risk of disease, infection, tumours, and autoimmune disorders (Franceschi et al., 1995, 2000; Solana and Pawelec, 1998; Malaguarnera et al., 2001).

Human NK cells express two structurally distinct receptor families that mediate their interactions; the c-type lectin-like heterodimer receptors and the immunoglobulin- like (Ig-like) receptors (Lopez-Botet et al., 2000). In contrast to the relatively conserved CD94/NKG2 lectin- like receptors, the Ig-like receptors display considerable variation, particularly the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). NK cells are known to clonally express KIR genes and whilst it is unclear how the repertoire of receptors expressed by NK cells is created, recent studies on the NK cell expression of KIR in different individuals imply that the repertoire is dependent on the presence of different genes in an individuals genome (Uhrberg et al., 1997;

Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the innate immune response and a hypothesis was proposed that a well-preserved NK cell activity is important for successful ageing (Sansoni et al., 1993; Franceschi et al., 1995;

Shilling et al., 2002). The KIR gene family represents a highly polymorphic class of receptor-encoding genes, which to date have displayed considerable allelic diversity and it is postulated that KIR polymorphism arises from both the occurrence of random point mutations and recombination between homologous KIR genes (Shilling et al., 1998; Witt

to ascertain whether this polymorphism within the KIR region was associated with successful ageing.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Subjects

Recently, our laboratory reported the presence of a common 22 bp deletion in the activatory KIR2DS4 gene that predicts a soluble KIR molecule (Maxwell et al., 2002). The deletion causes a frameshift predicting a truncated KIR2DS4 protein with a significantly altered D2 domain, which would be secreted due to the loss of the transmem- brane/cytoplasmic domains. A representative KIR2DS4 deletion allele sequence (KIR2DS4*003; available under accession number AJ417554) containing the 22 bp deletion in exon 5, is aligned against a non-deleted allele (KIR2DS4*00102) sequence in Fig. 1 (Dohring et al., 1996;

One hundred and eighty control samples (68% female, 32% male with an age-range of 19–45 years; mean age 29 years) were chosen at random from an anonymous DNA bank of normal healthy Caucasian individuals from the Northern Ireland population. The study involved 180 aged samples (71% female, 29% male with an age-range of 80–97 years; mean age 89 years) from the Belfast Elderly Longitudinal Free-living Ageing Study (Rea et al., 2000). All samples were from healthy Caucasian individuals from the Northern Ireland population displaying no signs of age- related disorders, still living independently and approximate SENIEUR status (Ligthart et al., 1984, 1990). Ethical approval was obtained from the Queen’s University of Belfast ethics committee.

In the present study, the frequency of the deleted from the KIR2DS4 gene was examined in a cohort of healthy aged Irish subjects in comparison to a younger control group

Numbering initiates on the first nucleotide of the ATG initiation codon of the 2DS4 coding sequence—only the cDNA sequence from position 21–1110 of the coding sequence was targeted in our PCR design. Dashes indicate complete identity while an * indicates a nucleotide deletion. Arrows highlight the location and direction of the two PCR primers (2DS4f and 3UTNKex) used to amplify the KIR cDNA sequence, and spaces are left under the PCR primer sequences as these sequences were not determined. The amino acid sequence of the new open reading frame accessed by 2DS4del due to the 22 bp deletion is depicted under its nucleotide sequence and terminates at the first in frame stop codon (V). The exon start positions are also highlighted. The only other nucleotide difference found in this 2DS4 deletion variant sequence is the presence of the G-A (nt489) change just downstream of the 22 bp deletion site, which in this particular instance would no longer be silent due to the resulting frameshift at the deletion site and concomitant R-K change in the predicted protein coding sequence representing the carboxyl end of the 2DS4 deletion variant.

The present study investigated the frequency of a common 22 bp deletion in the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor gene 2DS4 that predicts a soluble KIR molecule. A simple PCR methodology was employed to genotype 180 aged and 180 young control subjects from the Irish population. The observed frequencies of the deleted and full-length forms of the 2DS4 gene are displayed in Table 1.

2.2. PCR amplification

The 2DS4-specific oligonucleotide primers employed for the amplification of the 221/199 bp region of the 2DS4 gene were:

No significant associations were observed for the 2DS4 deletion variant with either age group or with respect to gender. The 2DS4 gene was present in the vast majority of samples examined, with only approximately 5% of each sample group appearing negative for the gene. The deleted form of the 2DS4 gene was identified at a high frequency (70–80%) within the Irish population as previously reported (Maxwell et al., 2002), and this raises the question concerning the possible function of this KIR variant. We previously reported the presence of mRNA for this gene (Maxwell et al., 2002) and studies are presently underway in an attempt to identify the hypothetical protein product in blood plasma. If the presence of this soluble KIR can be confirmed, it will be important to elucidate its role in the immune response to infection/disease and autoimmunity, and its potential effects on ageing.

PCR amplification was performed in 50 ml reaction volumes containing 67 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.8; 16 mM (NH ) SO ; 1.5 mM MgCl ; 0.01%(w/v) Tween; 200 mM 4 2 4 2 of each dNTP; 0.2 mM of each primer; 2 units Taq polymerase (Bioline UK Ltd, London, UK); 0.1–0.5 mg DNA. The following cycling conditions were employed: samples were held at 96 8C for 5 min, followed by 38 cycles of 96 8C for 1 min, 58 8C for 30 s, 72 8C for 1 min. After the final cycle, the samples were held at 72 8C for 5 min, and then at 15 8C until removed from the PCR machine (Perkin–Elmer 9600 Thermal Cycler).

The function of activating receptors such as remains unresolved. It has been postulated that they act in unison with the inhibitory receptors to cytolytic action or may act in response (Biassoni et al., 2000). Intriguingly, some appear to contain the 2DS4 deletion variant as the activating KIR gene, which again highlights the tance of elucidation of its functional role. the samples that appeared negative for the 2DS4

2.3. Genotyping of 2DS4 polymorphism

Successful amplification and genotyping was deter- mined, using the molecular weight (size: 22 bp) difference between the deleted and non-deleted forms of the 2DS4 gene, via gel electrophoresis on a 2% Metaphor agarose gel

were all identified as positive for the KIR2DS1 gene. A number of studies have suggested that the 2DS1 locus may in fact be an unconfirmed allele of the 2DS4 gene (Hsu et al., 2002a,b), while others report results that do not support this hypothesis indicating 2DS4 as a ‘distinct locus’ (Wilson et al., 2000; Norman et al., 2001). Until there is resolution of this issue and with respect to the present study, 2DS1 must be treated as an independent gene locus. Moreover, all studies to date have treated 2DS4 as an independent gene locus. This controversy highlights the work that still needs to be performed on the polygenic/polymorphic KIR loci to fully elucidate the genetic organisation and functionality of these NK cell receptors. Notably, when the frequency of the 2DS1 gene was examined in an aged and young control group no association was observed (unpublished data).

The KIR loci is located in the leukocyte receptor cluster on chromosome 19q13, a region previously associated with successful ageing in the Irish at the Apo-E loci (Rea et al., 2001). Although, no association was demonstrated in this study the polygenic and polymorphic nature of the KIR loci, and primary role of NK cells in response to viral/bacterial infections and tumours warrants more detailed attention. Considering the pivotal role KIRs may play in the innate immune response, it would be of great interest to repeat this analysis in centenarians who are believed to retain optimal immune function, with this study examining the frequency only in a cohort of successfully aged octogenarians and nonagenarians.

A study is presently underway to evaluate the role of genetic variation across the KIR gene network in immuno- senescence, and to elucidate the true influence of KIR polymorphism on longevity.
