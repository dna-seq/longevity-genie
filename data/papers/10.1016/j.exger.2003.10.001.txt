Abstract

Mice in which the specific region of the SHC gene is deleted live 30% longer without apparent disease. These mice have lower levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis, both of which have been linked to old age survival in man. This makes SHC1 an important candidate gene for longevity in humans. We found no variations in the p66 specific region of the SHC1 gene in 30 young and 30 extreme long-lived subjects. Thus in man, no common sequence variations occur in p66 specific region of the SHC1 gene. In two independent cohorts of respectively 730 and 563 subjects aged 85 and over, we tested the only known non-synonymous polymorphism, Met410Val, for association with longevity using a prospective follow-up design. In the first cohort, we found increasing valine allele frequency in three strata of increasing age at death (2.8–5.2%). Moreover, compared to Met/Met carriers, mortality rate was a factor of 0.71 (95% CI 0.45–1.13) reduced for Met/Val carriers in the combined cohorts, with similar risk estimates in both cohorts. Low valine allele frequency resulted, however, in low power to detect statistical significance. These data suggest that an association between the Met410Val polymorphism and longevity in humans may exist.

abnormalities (Migliaccio et al., 1999). Cells derived from p66SHC2/2 mice show increased resistance to apoptosis in reaction to oxidative stress (Migliaccio et al., 1999), and intracellular oxidant levels were found to be decreased (Nemoto and Finkel, 2002). Apoptosis (Campisi, 2003) and reactive oxygen species (Martin et al., 1996) have been suggested to play a role in human longevity. Recently, it was shown in mice fed a high-fat diet that deletion of the p66SHC gene reduces vascular cell apoptosis and early atherogenesis (Napoli et al., 2003). Taken together, these findings implicate the p66SHC1 gene as an important candidate gene for human longevity.

1. Introduction

The SHC gene, named after its Src and Collagen homologous regions, has been related to longevity in mice, but the role of SHC1 gene variants with respect to human longevity has not yet been investigated. Mice in which the p66SHC specific region of the SHC gene is knocked out (p66SHC2/2) have a higher resistance to paraquat, which causes oxidative stress, and live up to 30% longer in the absence of other phenotypic

The human SHC1 adaptor protein is encoded by one gene but has three isoforms: p66SHC1, p52SHC1 and p46SHC1. All three are adaptor proteins in the insulin-signaling pathway, but their downstream effects differ (Migliaccio et al., 1997). Both p52SHC1 and p46SHC1 are associated with MAPK signaling and are highly conserved throughout evolution;

Fig. 1. The SHC1 protein isoforms. The p66SHC1 protein is 583 amino acids long and is translated from the long transcript of the SHC1 gene. The p52 and p46 isoforms are 473 and 428 amino acids long, respectively, and are translated from both the long and the short transcript of the gene. The position of the methionine to valine variant is shown for the different proteins. Serine 36 (S36) in p66SHC1 is phosphorylated in reaction to oxidative damage (Le et al., 2001). Serine 138 (S138) in p66SHC1 is phosphorylated in reaction to insulin binding, resulting in down-regulation of SHC1 (Faisal et al., 2002). Tyrosine residue at position 427 (Y427) of p66SHC1 is phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation, causing inhibition of the MAPK pathway (Migliaccio et al., 1997) CH2, collagen homology domain 2; PTB, phosphothyrosine binding domain; CH1, collagen homology domain 1; SH2, Src homology domain 2.

2. Methods

p66SHC1 signaling is associated with apoptosis and is only seen in vertebrates (Luzi et al., 2000). The SHC1 gene contains one known coding variation, which corresponds to Met225Val in the p46 isoform, Met300Val in the p52 isoform and to Met410Val in the p66 isoform (Fig. 1) (Almind et al., 1999). No association of the Met300Val variation was found with birth weight and length, impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Almind et al., 1999). However, these observations do not exclude the possibility that the variant specifically affects the function of p66SHC1 and not of p46SHC1 and p52SHC1. Neither the p66SHC1 specific part of the SHC1 gene nor its upstream promoter region have been investigated for variations in humans.

2.1. Subject selection

The Leiden 85-plus Study is a population-based study in which all inhabitants of Leiden, The Netherlands, aged 85 years and over were invited to take part. Between 1986 and 1988 a total number of 977 participants were enrolled in cohort’87 (Slagboom et al., 2000). Blood samples were taken at baseline. Survival data for all participants were available until May 2001 at which date only 15 had survived. Between 1997 and 1999 another 599 subjects were enrolled in cohort’97 on their 85th birthday (Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2002). Survival data were available until

We investigated the association between SHC1 gene variants and longevity in the Leiden 85-plus Study, which comprises of two independent cohorts of community dwell- ing citizens aged 85 years and over who were prospectively followed for survival. First, as sequence variation that would result in a survival benefit would be most easily detected in a sample of the oldest subjects, while sequence variation that would result in a survival disadvantage would be most easily detected in the sample of young subjects, we amplified and sequenced the p66SHC1 specific region of the coding sequences and the promoter of the SHC1 gene in a sample of extreme survivors of the Leiden 85-plus Study as well as in a young control group. In both cases, we set the limit for detecting sequence variations at a population frequency of at least 5%, as lower frequencies wouldstrongly limit the power of further analyses on the association of the sequence variation with longevity. Second, we tested for association between the Met410Val variant and mortality among these oldest old using a prospective follow-up design.

Based on the set limit for detecting sequence variations at a population frequency of at least 5%, thirty of the longest- lived subjects (median age 98 years) and 30 younger volunteers (median age 31 years) were selected for screen- ing for new polymorphisms in the p66 specific region of the SHC1 gene and the p66SHC1 promoter. The Met410Val polymorphism was determined individually in all Leiden

The medical ethical committee of the Leiden University Medical Center approved this study.

2.2. DNA isolation

For cohort’87 DNA was extracted from frozen mono- cytes shortly after inclusion by protein precipitation using potassium acetate and chloroform extraction. To increase sample size and DNA quantity, we performed new DNA extractions from stored frozen monocytes for this study,

probe assay (Applied Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer’s specifications with the following modifications. A qPCR core kit was used (Eurogentec) and half the amount of probes in a volume of 18 ml. As forward primer Met410Val-for1 and as reverse primer Met410Val-rev1 were used, resulting in a 122 bp DNA fragment (Table 1). Real time PCR was performed on an ABI 7700 (Applied Biosystems) using the standard protocol except 55 cycles in stage 3.

Bases in lower case demarcate the position of the SNP. All primers were designed using Primer3 software (Roze and Skaletsky, 2001). All probes were designed using PrimerExpress (Applied Biosystems).

2.6. Statistical analysis

The frequencies of variations in the p66SHC1 sequences were calculated and are presented as percentage with their 95% confidence interval. In all cases of a frequency of zero the ‘rule of zero equals three’ was applied. This rule states that the confidence interval of an observed frequency of zero reaches from zero to three (Hanley and Lippman-Hand,

using the QIAamp blood minikit (Qiagen). This yielded a total sample size of 736.

For cohort’97 DNA was extracted from buffy coats the QIAamp blood midikit (Qiagen). This yielded a size of 563.

2.3. PCR and purification

As virtually all subjects from cohort’87 had died, they were stratified for age at death in three groups: 85–90 years, 90–95 years and 95 and over. Frequencies of the different Met410Val genotypes were calculated for the separate groups and are presented as percentages. Significance was tested using a Chi-square and linear by linear correlation.

A standard PCR was performed with 10 ng of genomic DNA, using Amplitaq gold (Applied Biosystems). We used primers p66-for1 and p66-rev1 (Table 1), resulting in a 981 base pairs (bp) fragment. The PCR product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

Survival curves from age 85 to 90 years were plotted for valine allele carriers and non-carriers in combined cohorts. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate sex-adjusted mortality risks and their 95% confidence interval for both cohorts combined and separately. For cohort’87 a left truncated model was used.

Sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISMw 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sample files were processed using the STADEN Package (Staden, 1996). Sequences were assembled using a normal shotgun assembly and compared to the previously published sequence (GenBank accession number: AF455141). All trace files were reviewed by hand for mutations.

All calculations were performed with the SAS system, RELEASE 8.0.

3. Results

shown in Fig. 2. The 981 bp fragment includes a p66SHC1 specific promoter area, 50 UTR and CH2 encoding region, and a p66–p52SHC1 joint region. We found no sequence variation in the p66SHC1 fragment in the sample of 30 young blood donors, nor in the sample of the 30 oldest old. As each subgroup of 30 persons represents a sample size of 60 chromosomes, the upper limit of the confidence interval for

the observed frequency of zero was calculated to be 2.5% for the combined group of young and old persons, and 5% within both subgroups separately. This means that the maximum allele frequency of undetected polymorphisms is 2.5 and 5%, respectively.

Allele frequencies of the valine allele in different strata of age at death in cohort’87 of people aged 85 years and over are listed in Table 2. All frequencies were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. No subjects homozygous for valine were found. The frequency of Met/Val hetero- zygous carriers increases with age at death, suggesting, although not statistically significant ðp ¼ 0: 14Þ; lower mortality among the heterozygote carriers.

Survival in both cohorts of the Leiden 85-plus Study from age 85 to 90 years is shown in Fig. 3. The precision weighted pooled mortality risk was a factor of 0.71 (0.45–1.13) decreased for Met/Val carriers compared to Met/Met carriers based on the combined observations in both cohorts. Strikingly, the same effect is observed in both cohorts independently. In cohort’87 mortality risk was 0.63 (0.29–1.36). In this subgroup 126 of the 430 (29%) subjects had died. In cohort’97 mortality risk and 95% confidence interval for Met/Val heterozygous subjects is 0.75 (0.42– 1.34). After five years of follow-up 201 of the 563 (36%) subjects had died.

with longevity; however, no statistical significance was reached in our different analyses, probably due to low Val allele frequencies.

No common sequence variation was found in the 941 bp domain specifically coding for the p66SHC1 isoform and its core promoter. This, together with the fact that in the rest of the gene (1505 bp) only one coding variant was found at a low frequency, a methionine to valine change at position 410 of p66, suggests that major variations in the SHC1 gene may not be tolerated. This is in contrast to findings in the mouse, where removing the entire exon 1 of the SHC gene resulted in longer lived mice with lower levels of oxidative stress (Migliaccio et al., 1999), lower levels of cell apoptosis (Migliaccio et al., 1999) and reduced early atherogenesis when fed a high-fat diet (Napoli et al., 2003). Our findings implicate that such sequence changes with strong effects on gene functionality do not occur naturally at high frequency in the p66 specific part of the human SHC1 gene, thus raising the possibility that evolution may have selected against their occurrence.

Although neither the trend observed for enrichment of the Val allele with increasing age of death, nor the decreased mortality risk of Met/Val carriers compared to Met/Met carriers in the separate and combined cohorts reached statistical significance, these results all hint at a similar suggestion, namely that an association of the Met410Val polymorphism with longevity may exist.

4. Discussion

Our results also suggest that an association between the Met410Val polymorphism and longevity may exist. Heterozygote carriers had lower mortality in two indepen- dent cohorts with an average decrease in mortality of 29%. These findings suggest a beneficial effect of the valine- allele. The allele frequency of the valine allele is, however,

The key finding of this study is twofold. First, we did not detect common sequence variation in the p66 specific region of the SHC1 gene that would occur of at a population frequency of at least 5%. Second, our data suggest that the Met410Val polymorphism in SHC1 may be associated

low, and therefore there is low power to find statistically significant differences. A previous study failed to associate the Met410Val variant to insulin secretion, insulin sensi- tivity, type II diabetes, birth weight and length (Almind et al., 1999). However, here also the low valine allele frequency may have prohibited detection of statistical significance. To date, no in vitro studies have been published on the functionality of the variant. It is surrounded by tyrosine residues that, upon phosphorylation, effect insulin signaling. Our data suggest that the p66SHC1 Met410Val polymorphism may be functional and associated with longevity.

activity (which stimulate ROS scavenging and repair of oxidative damage). Because activation of p66SHC1 decreases forkhead activity, we predict that the beneficial valine allele is associated with mildly decreased p66SHC1 activity levels. Taken together, this hypothesis would explain the potential role for p66SHC1 in human longevity.

the p66 specific region of the SHC1 gene and our data hint at an association of the Met410Val variant with longevity. However, further study on the functionality of the Met410Val polymorphism is needed.

In reaction to oxidative stress p66SHC1 becomes activated by phosphorylation that takes place in the region specific to p66SHC1 (Le et al., 2001), causing decreased activity of the Forkhead Transcription Factor FKHRL1 (Nemoto and Finkel, 2002; Alvarez et al., 2001). This results in a higher level of apoptosis and a lower level of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (Alvarez et al., 2001). Cells defective in apoptosis tend to survive with excess DNA damage and thus allow DNA replication despite DNA damages, ultimately leading to carcinogenesis. On the other hand, methylation of the p66SHC1 promoter decreases the expression level of p66SHC1 (Ventura et al., 2002), which has been suggested to play a role in longevity (Purdom and Chen, 2003). Conversely, high expression levels of p66SHC1 have been related to metastasis and carcinogenesis in human tumor tissue (Jackson et al., 2000). This can be explained as a cellular reaction to tumor growth and an attempt to switch from growth to apoptosis. Furthermore, the function of p66SHC1 has been related to the function of tumor suppressor protein p53 (Trinei et al., 2002). Together they regulate steady state levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. As recently shown by the comparison of p53þ/m (which possess overactive p53) and p532/2 mice, induction of apoptosis can have both beneficial and adverse effects (Tyner et al., 2002). Loss of p53 results in loss of genomic stability and predisposes cells to becoming cancerous: p532/2 mice develop normally but soon die of cancer. Conversely, p53þ/m mice are resistant to cancer, but age prematurely. Thus, excessive induction of apoptosis leads to premature ageing, possibly due to the exhaustion of division competent stem cells, while insufficient induction of apoptosis may cause cancer (Tyner et al., 2002). Following this line of reasoning, we speculate that major mutations in p66SHC1 may not be tolerated because they would disrupt the proteins function in induction of apoptosis and would consequently compromise its role in tumour suppression. Subtle mutations, however, may have a life prolonging effect because reduced apoptosis may lead to a greater reserve capacity in terms of number of division competent stem cells. Life extension may result from increased resistance to oxidative stress due to up-regulation of forkhead
