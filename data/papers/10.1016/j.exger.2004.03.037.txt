Abstract

The C allele at position 2174 in the promoter of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene has been associated with reduced gene expression and reduced plasma levels of IL-6. Given that IL-6 tracks with functional disability and age-related diseases, there may be attrition or reduction in the frequency of the homozygous subjects, who produce higher IL-6 serum levels, in older survivors in a population. In fact, a marked reduction of the IL-6*G/*G genotype was recently demonstrated in male though not female Italian centenarians compared with younger age groups. First aim of the present study was to investigate whether there was evidence of an association among IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism and extreme longevity in a population of 81 centenarians compared with a control group of 122 middle-aged healthy subjects (mean age: 51 ^ 18 SD; range: 19–73 years), from Apulia (Southern Italy). Secondly, we also tested possible interaction of apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles with the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism in view of our recent findings for reduced APOE 14 allele in centenarians. No differences have been found in the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter allele and genotype frequencies between centenarians and controls nor was there any observed interaction with APOE alleles that are also reputed to be linked to longevity. Regional genetic differences in conjunction with differing environmental factors may explain in part previous results suggesting a role of this polymorphism in longevity. q 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction

Ferrucci et al., 1999; Ershler and Keller, 2000). Bonafe` et al. found that subjects who are genetically predisposed to produce high levels of IL-6, i.e. IL-6*G/*G homozygous men, have a reduced capacity to reach the extreme longevity. In fact, they noted a marked reduction of the IL-6*G/*G genotype in male though not female Italian centenarians compared with elderly (60–80 years) and long-lived (81–99 years) subjects. On the other hand, they found that the age-related increase of IL-6 serum levels in women was independent of the 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism (Bonafe` et al., 2001). Furthermore, Olivieri et al. found that cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from C allele carrier individuals produced smaller amount of IL-6 than non-carriers and that IL-6 production by PBMC in vitro increased with age in C allele carriers but not in non-carriers. They also found that C allele carriers

The interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene in humans is located in the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p21) and has a 2174 G/C polymorphism in its promoter region. Fishman et al. (1998) reported that the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism is associated with reduced IL-6 gene expression and also with reduced levels of IL-6 plasma levels. An age-related increase of IL-6 concentration has been found in serum, plasma and mononuclear blood cell culture among elderly people and centenarians (Fagiolo et al., 1993; Baggio et al., 1998). Recent population-based studies identified among elderly the magnitude of IL-6 serum levels as a predictor of

had lower plasma levels of IL-6 than non-carriers, but this phenomenon was significant only in men (Olivieri et al., 2002). In recent studies, subjects carrying the G allele showed increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Pola et al., 2002a), multi-infarct dementia (MID) (Pola et al., 2002b), peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) (Flex et al., 2002), asymptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis quantified as increased intima-media thickness by high- resolution ultrasonography (Rauramaa et al., 2000), and longer stays in the hospital and in the intensive care unit after surgical coronary revascularization (Burzotta et al., 2001). Finally, in subjects under pravastatin treatment in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), the IL-6*C*/*C genotype was associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (Basso et al., 2002).

severe functional limitations. The group of middle-aged adults included 122 healthy subjects (mean age: 51 ^ 18 SD; range: 19–73 years; 78 women and 44 men). These two groups had the same geographical origin and were sex- matched, reflecting the sex differential in longevity in Italy (Capurso et al., 1997). The study protocol received the approval of the Ethical Committee of the University of Bari. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their relatives.

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples by the GFXe Genomic Blood DNA Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences). APOE genotypes were determined as detailed elsewhere (Panza et al., 1999). The IL-6 promoter genotyping was performed on Light Cycler system (Roche, Mannheim Germany) by melting curve analysis using specifically designed hybridization probes with fluorescent dyes: Fluoresceine Isothiocyanate (FITC) 0 labeled anchor (5 -CGACCTAAGCTGCACTTTTCCCCC- 0 TAX-3 ) and Light Cycler (LC) Red 705 labeled sensor 0 0 (5 -TGTGTCTTGCCATGCTAAAGGACGp-3 ; TIBMOL BIOL) probes. The primers used in the amplification 0 were: forward primer, 5 - AAATTCTAGCCTGT- 0 0 TAATCTGGTC-3 , reverse primer, 5 - ATCCCACATTT- 0 GATAAATCTTTGT-3 (Moos et al., 2000). The following 20 ml reaction mix was used for PCR amplification and subsequent detection of fluorescence from hybridization probes: 100 ng of genomic DNA, 50 pmol each primer, 3 pmol each probe, 3.5 mM MgCl , 1 £ DNA master 2 hybridization probes (Roche Diagnostics). A PCR ‘touch- down’ was performed to reduce mispriming and increase efficiency. The amplification program consisted of initial denaturation of 2 min at 95 8C, then 45 cycles with three temperature segments. The first segment was 94 8C for 10 s at 20 8C/s of temperature transition rate for denaturation; a second segment for both primer and probe annealing was of 15 s at 62 8C for five cycles followed by a 0.4 8C decrease of the annealing temperature every second cycle up to 55 8C; the temperature transition rate was 20 8C/s. A third temperature segment for primer extension was 72 8C for 10 s at 20 8C/s of temperature transition rate. After amplification, the melting curve analysis program was performed with three different temperature segments, as well: the temperature was initially raised to 94 8C for 30 s for denaturation, then lowered to 40 8C at 20 8C/s, and held at 40 8C for 1 min to permit probe annealing, and finally raised to 90 8C at 0.15 8C/s of temperature transition rate while collecting fluorescence data continuously to obtain the melting curve analysis profile temperature. A final cooling at 40 8C was carried out. The melting temperatures were 61 8C for G allele and 69 8C for C allele (Table 1).

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a major constituents of very low density lipoproteins, and a polymorphism in APOE has been extensively examined in populations worldwide for its association with an increased risk of CAD and AD (Davignon et al., 1988; Saunders et al., 1993). Recent findings of a higher prevalence of the APOE 1 2 allele and a lower prevalence of the APOE 1 4 allele in centenarians than in younger controls suggested a role of the APOE polymorphism in longevity (Schachter et al., 1994; Louhija et al., 1994; Panza et al., 1999). The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether there was evidence in Southern Italy to support findings of an association between the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism and the extreme longevity. Secondly, we tested the possible interaction of APOE alleles with the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism in view of our recent findings for reduced APOE 1 4 allele in centenarians (Panza et al., 1999).

Italy) have been studied. These included 81 centenarians and 122 middle-aged, unrelated subjects or volunteers who presented themselves to the Department of Geriatrics, Bari University Hospital, Italy, between March 1995 and December 1998. The population of 81 centenarians was composed of 62 women and 19 men with a mean age of ^ 100 2 years. Centenarians were recruited from all over the Apulia region (Southern Italy) (regional distribution: 40% Bari region, 18% central, 4% northern, 5% eastern, 15% western, 18% southern), at their home, through the Central Population Register of Apulia. They were all Caucasians residing in Southern Italy. The criteria for inclusion were to be at least 99 years old on the day of blood collection and no known diagnosis of dementia or other chronic neurological diseases or psychiatric syndromes with cognitive impairment (Solfrizzi et al., 1999), cerebrovascu- lar disease, nephropathy or end-stage renal disease, and no

population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (centenar- ians: Pearson x2 ¼ 0: 41; df ¼ 1; p ¼ 0: 52; middle-aged subjects: x2 ¼ 0: 54; df ¼ 1; p ¼ 0: 36). No statistically significant differences were found in the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter genotype between centenarians and middle-aged subjects in our population (Table 3). Similarly, the frequency of the IL-6*C allele (or vice versa IL-6*G allele) was comparable between centenarians and middle-aged control subjects (Table 3). Finally, we did not find any 3-way statistically significant interaction among IL-6 2174 G/C promoter genotype, APOE alleles, and longevity (odds ratio: 1.49 CI 95% 0.64–3.84, Exact p-value ,0.45) (Table 4).

4. Discussion

In the present study, we didn’t find statistically significant differences in IL-6 2174 G/C promoter genotype or allele frequencies between centenarians and middle-aged subjects from Southern Italy. This study did not provide evidence to support the suggested role of the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism in human longevity due to a decreased frequency of the IL-6*G/*G genotype in male centenarians compared with elderly and long-lived subjects in the only other study on centenarians (Bonafe` et al., 2001).

2.3. Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was performed by Pearson x2 test to make genotype and allele comparisons as well as test for agreement of data with Hardy–Weinberg principles. Allele frequencies were determined by allele counting. To express variances of the allele frequencies, 95% confidence intervals were used, the upper and lower values of which were calculated according to the Wilson’s formulas. To evaluate whether the association between IL6 2174 G/C promoter genotypes and longevity were homogeneous in all APOE strata we used a permutation-based exact logistic model by LogXact procedure implemented in the SAS system (Proc- LogXact 5). Statistical analysis were conducted with the SPSS software, version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA).

associations of the IL-6*G/*G genotype with elevated circulating IL-6 plasma levels at all ages: young adults, elderly adults, and centenarians (Fishman et al., 1998; Burzotta et al., 2001; Bonafe` et al., 2001; Olivieri et al., 2002). In fact, high IL-6 concentrations were a credible predictor of increased disability and mortality in the elderly (Ferrucci et al., 1999; Harris et al., 1999; Ershler and Keller, 2000), and the IL-6*G/*G genotype was associated, probably through increased IL-6 plasma levels, with higher risk of AD (Pola et al., 2002a), MID (Pola et al., 2002b), and vascular diseases (Rauramaa et al., 2000; Burzotta et al., 2001; Flex et al., 2002). However, how the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism modulates IL-6 plasma levels remains controversial. In fact, in vitro different models have been proposed to evaluate the influence of the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism on IL-6 production with

and nonagerian subjects compared with younger subjects of the local population, aged 20–45 years (Rea et al., 2003). This trend appeared more marked in elderly males compared with the females (Ross et al., 2003) but both groups showed an almost 10% decrease frequency in the oldest subjects. In the present study, there is a difference of 12% in the IL-6*G/*G genotype frequency between centenarians and middle-aged group (52 and 64%, respectively), though not statistically significant. ^ Concerning our control group (mean age: 51 18 SD; range: 19–73 years), some of them, will turn out to be centenarians, however this kind of overlap between the two populations cannot be expected to be rather frequent. On the contrary, in the study of Bonafe` et al. (2001), the long-lived subjects (81–99 years) appear to be somewhat overlapped in age with the centenarian group.

environments (Terry et al., 2000; Olivieri et al., 2002; Olivieri et al., 2003). In vivo, several studies have reported that the IL-6*C/*C genotype is associated with higher levels of IL-6 (Jones et al., 2001; Kilpinen et al., 2001; Brull et al., 2001, 2002), and Rauramaa et al. (2000) found no effect of the polymorphism on baseline IL-6 plasma levels in 92 asymptomatic males.

Explanation for the conflicting findings that have been reported could be linked to variability in the strength of association that may exist between the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism and longevity which could be modified by European regional differences in allele frequencies that we have identified for both the APOE and angiotensin I converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) genes in centenarians (Panza et al., 1999, 2003). In fact, interest- ingly, the IL-6*C allele frequency appears to vary across Europe, with an increasing trend from South to North in these very old populations: centenarians in the present study 29%, Italian centenarians 28.8% (Bonafe` et al., 2001), Irish octo/nonagenarians 45% (Rea et al., 2003), Finnish nonagerians 51% (Wang et al., 2001).

study of Bonafe` et al. on the role of IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism in centenarians (Bonafe` et al., 2001). Furthermore, two other studies have been conducted on this polymorphism in octogenarian and nonagenarian subjects (Wang et al., 2001; Rea et al., 2003). In fact, in 250 Finnish community living and hospitalized nonagenarians and 400 healthy blood donors, aged 18–60 years, there was a lack of association between human longevity and gene variants of IL-1 cluster, IL-6 2174 G/C promoter, IL10, and tumor nervous factor a, alone or in combination, though there was a reduction of 2.5% of the Il-6*G/*G frequency between nonagenarians and widely age-selected younger control group (Wang et al., 2001). On the contrary, Rea et al., in the Belfast Elderly Longitudinal Free-living Ageing STudy (BELFAST), found a trend for a reduced frequency of the IL-6*G/*G genotype in 193 octogenarian

In the present study, we did not find any statistically differences in rates between IL-6 2174 G/C alleles and centenarians among the APOE strata, view of evidence of an involvement of this polymorphism longevity (Panza et al., 2004). In fact, recently we showed the frequency of the APOE 1 4 allele was significantly

In the same study the 1 2 allele was found to be increased in centenarians although not significantly (Panza et al., 1999). In this study, we also observed and reported for the first time a significant geographic trend for increasing 1 2 allele and decreasing 1 4 allele prevalence in centenarian populations from Northern to Southern regions of Europe (Panza et al., 1999). We suggest that this geographical trend could influence the strength of association between the 1 2 allele and longevity which was recently confirmed in Finnish centenarians (Frisoni et al., 2001).

While it appears that APOE may play a role in longevity (Schachter et al., 1994; Louhija et al., 1994; Panza et al., 1999; Frisoni et al., 2001), the current evidence in conjunction with previous works with contrasting findings (Bonafe` et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001; Rea et al., 2003) does not support a similar involvement for the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter gene, nor of an interaction between the alleles of both genes. However, this study has some potential limitations. In fact, we must also acknowledge that the cross-sectional design and a relatively small number of centenarians of the present study are limited in their statistical power and thus we cannot make definitive conclusions. Only longitudinal studies specifically designed for addressing the impact of the IL-6 2174 G/C promoter polymorphism on extreme longevity could provide more robust evidence for further understanding the role of this polymorphisms in the reaching of human extreme longevity.
