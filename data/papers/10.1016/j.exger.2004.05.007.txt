Abstract

Recent studies have demonstrated a significant association between mutations in genes involved in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway and extension of the life span of model organisms. In this study which compared 122 Japanese semisupercentenarians (older than 105) with 122 healthy younger controls, we examined polymorphic variations of six genes which are involved in insulin/IGF1 signaling. These genes were FOXO1A, INSR, IRS1, PIK3CB, PIK3CG, and PPARGC1A. We investigated the possible association of each gene locus and longevity by haplotype-based association analyses using 18 SNPs from public databases and the published literature. One INSR haplotype, which was comprised of 2 SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, was more frequent in semisupercentenarians than in younger controls. q 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

insulin-like receptor gene (InR) was also reported in Drosophila melanogaster (Tatar et al., 2001). At almost the same time, the ablation of the D. melanogaster gene chico, which encodes an insulin receptor substrate, was reported to extend the life span of the fly (Clancy et al., 2001). Regulationsoflifespanbyinsulinreceptorand IGF1receptor were also reported in mice (Bluher et al., 2003; Holzenberger et al., 2003). Based on these studies, genes involved in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway are believed to play a role in longevity throughout evolution. In fact, polymorphic vari- ations of the genes for insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase have been reported to affect human longevity (Bonafe et al., 2003).

Recent studies using model organisms have demon- strated a significant association between mutations in genes involved in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling pathway and extension of the life span. The first examples of such genes were found in Caenorhabditis elegans (Kenyon et al., 1993). They include daf-2, an ortholog of the insulin/IGF1 receptor gene family, and daf-16, an ortholog of the forkhead transcription factors

Another example is age-1 which is the C. elegans ortholog of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of phosphoinosi- tide-3-kinase, a protein involved in insulin/IGF1 signal

In this study, we compared 122 Japanese semisupercen- tenarians (SSCs) (older than 105) with 122 healthy younger controls. We examined polymorphic variations of the genes for six proteins, forkhead box O1A (FOXO1A), insulin

present for this study (Table 1). Forty-six SSCs were living at home and 76 were institutionalized. None were in an acute care situation and none were receiving tube feeding. The gender matched control subjects comprised 122 healthy volunteers (105 female, 17 male, mean age 33.3G11.4 years, range 19–63) recruited from hospital and institutional workers, medical and nursing school students, and bank clerks. The control subjects were free from diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Smoking and alcohol consumption was moderate to nil. All subjects enrolled in this study were Japanese. Twenty milliliters of non-fasting venous blood was collected from all subjects, and genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral leukocytes according to standard protocols. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants directly, or by proxy. This study was approved by the ethics committees of the medical school of Keio University and RIKEN Yokohama Institute.

ac.jp/) using the criteria that minor allele frequencies were more than 10% in the Japanese population. Five SNPs in the FOXO1A, IRS1 and PIK3CB gene loci (1, 1, 1, and 2 SNPs, respectively) were from Bonafe et al. (2003). Additionally 2 non-synonymous SNPs in the PPARGC1A gene locus were selected from Ek et al. (2001) (Table 2). The genomic DNA sequences of FOXO1A, INSR, IRS1, PIK3CB, PIK3CG, and PPARGC1A were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, USA) (accession num- bers NT_024524, NT_011255, NT_005403, NT_005612, NT_079596, and NT_006316, respectively). For each polymorphism not obtained from JSNP, we ensured that there was a sufficiently high frequency in our subjects by testing 24 control subjects. Polymorphisms were typed by DNA sequencing using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) or by real-time pyrophosphate DNA sequencing (Ronaghi et al., 1996, 1998) using a PSQ 96 system (Pyrosequencing AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Fig. 1. Pairwise LD in FOXO1A, INSR, IRS1, PIK3CB, and PPARGC1A evaluated by jD0j and r2 estimations. The LD between all pairs of SNPs was evaluated by measuring jD0j and r2 values. Designated SNP IDs are shown in Table 2. Pairwise LD was determined in 92 younger controls. SNP pairs in high LD (jD0jO0.5, r2O0.5) are shown as gray boxes. Upper right triangles show values of jD0j and lower left triangles show values of r2.

The chi-square test was performed between SSCs and control subjects for each allelic and haplotypic frequency. Statistical significance was inferred when P!0.05. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) was estimated as DZ x Kp q , 11 1 1 wherex 11isthefrequencyofhaplotypeA 1B 1,andp 1andq 1are the frequencies of alleles A and B at locus A and B, 1 1 respectively. A standardized LD coefficient, r, is given by D/(p p q q )1/2wherep andq arethefrequenciesoftheother 1 2 1 2 2 2 alleles at locus A and B, respectively (Hill and Robertson, 1968). Lewontin’s coefficient D0 is given by D/D , max where D Z min[q p ,p q ] when DO0 (Lewontin, 1964). max 1 2 1 2 Haplotype frequencies for multiple loci were estimated by the expectation-maximization method.

An additional 122 SSCs and 30 healthy younger controls were genotyped for an association analysis using 16 SNPs in six genes (Table 2). Two SNPs (IN3 and IN4) in INSR showed a weak difference between SSCs and controls. These SNPs are in LD with each other (jD0jZ 0.899) and are within 2.4 kb of each other (Fig. 1).

Computations were performed using SNPAlyze software (Dynacom, Mobara, Japan).

Haplotypes were constructed on the basis of the genotype data from these SNPs in INSR. The expectation-maximiza- tion algorithm, with phase-unknown samples, was used to estimate haplotype frequencies. The MM haplotype (M: major allele) was more frequent in SSCs (57.0%) than Z in controls (47.3%) (P 0.030) (Table 3).

3.1. Pairwise LD in 5 genes

Among the SNPs not from the JSNP database, 3B2 in PIK3CB was not polymorphic in our 24 control samples (Table 2). Consequently this SNP was excluded from further experiments. The 92 healthy controls were genotyped for each of the 17 selected SNPs. The strength of LD for each SNP pair within each gene was measured using the jD0j and the r2 values (Fig. 1). This figure shows that FO1 and FO4 in FOXO1A locus are in very tight LD with each other (r2Z 0.789). FO1 was selected as the representative SNP for this SNP pair and was examined in further analysis. FO4 was excluded from further analysis.

study. This work was supported in part by a grant to RIKEN GSC from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

To date many genetic variations in the INSR locus have been reported to be associated with diseases including diabetes mellitus, leprechaunism, and Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 147670). To our knowledge this is the first report showing associations between genetic polymorphisms of INSR and human longevity. Through a study of Japanese centenarians, we found the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in centenarians to be significantly lower than that in the general population (manuscript in preparation). A common variant in the PPARGC1A gene has been reported to be associated with type II diabetes mellitus (Ek et al., 2001). The PPARGC1A protein interacts with FOXO1 in an insulin- regulated mechanism of gluconeogenesis (Puigserver et al., 2003). The risk variant (PP1 in Table 2) present frequently in both SSCs and controls (about 50%) and no association with the common variation and longevity was found in this study.

Although a significant association was observed between the IN3-M/IN4-M haplotype in INSR and longevity, both SNPs are located in introns and the functional implication of this haplotype association remains uncertain. Very recently a polymorphic variation of IGF1R was reported to affect human longevity in the Italian population (Bonafe et al., 2003) but the functional implication of the polymorphic variation also remains to be elucidated. It is noteworthy that both INSR and IGF1R are members of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase family. Further comprehensive studies of the INSR locus, especially on the region including IN3 and IN4, together with the IGF1R locus are needed to identify the causal variations that enable or prevent human longevity and to clarify the molecular mechanisms of human longevity.
