Abstract. A common polymorphism (rs3851179) in the PICALM (phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein) gene has been recently associated with reduced risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). We analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of the PICALM polymorphism in 813 Italian subjects, including LOAD patients and centenarians. The segregation of the PICALM rs3851179 showed no statistically significant difference between LOAD cases and controls. The implication of a genetic variant at PICALM is confirmed for the first time, in centenarians, thus suggesting a possible role in longevity.

ease. It has become clear that the majority of common genetic variants contribute only slightly to an increased risk for the disease, but in combination they have an important impact on disease predisposition. Recently, three large Genome-wide association (GWA) studies, including more than 48,000 subjects, tested hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and veri- fied strong evidence of five new susceptibility loci for AD, CLU (clusterin, chr 8), PICALM (phosphatidyli- nositol binding clathrin assembly protein, chr 11), CR1 (complement component [3b/4b] receptor 1, Chr 1), BIN1 (bridging integrator 1, chr 2) and EXOC3L2 (exocyst complex component 3-like 2, chr 19) [2–4]. Several large case control studies have recently con-

For almost twenty years, numerous molecular genetic studies in patients with the familial form of Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) have revealed more than 220 pathogenetic mutations in the three candidate \BP genes (A PP, PS1, PS2) contributing to the pathogene- sis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Despite numerous years of research, only one common genetic variant 4 (the 4 allele) in the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been considered a risk factor for the dis-

in PICALM rs3851179 with a reduced risk for Late Onset AD patients (LOAD) has been reported [2]. PICALM, located on 11q14.2, encodes the ubiqui- tously expressed 652 amino acid protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [9], which is an essential step in the intracellular trafficking of pro- teins, lipids, growth factors, and neurotransmitters. It is involved in endocytosis and in intracellular traf- ficking of VAMP2, a synaptic vesicle protein. The PICALM protein is indispensable for neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic membrane, which is impor- tant for memory formation and neuronal function [10].  Moreover, the protein may play a role in amyloid- clearance from the brain.

All cases (20% autopsy proven) were clinically eval- uated according to published guidelines and the AD diagnosis fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-

Presence of a family history of dementia (at least two first-degree relatives in two generations) was consid- ered an exclusion criterion. All controls were carefully assessed using a rigorous clinical history evaluation and a general/neurological examination in order to exclude the presence of any neurological disorder. They were interviewed in order to exclude the presence of relatives with exceptional longevity (>100 years) in past generations.

The identification of protective variants against age-related illnesses, such as neurodegenerative disor- ders, may provide an important contribution to better understanding healthy aging. Many association stud- ies confirmed a key role of centenarian subjects in the identification of protective genetic profiles [11, 12]. In this regard, a recent study analyzed rs3850179 in the PICALM gene in the oldest old, finding a positive association between the A allele in subjects with better cognitive functioning [13].

Informed consent for genetic screening was obtai- ned from the study participants or, where appropri- ate, a relative or legal representative, and the study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Helsinki Declaration.

By using the demographic lists provided by the reg- istry offices, potentially eligible subjects with excep- tional longevity were identified and 60% agreed to participate. Centenarians were in good health, relative to their very advanced age, and did not present the more common age-related pathologies (e.g., severe cogni- tiveimpairment,severephysicalimpairment,clinically

In light of these findings, we analyzed the genotype and allele distribution of the rs3851179 polymorphism in PICALM in Italian LOAD patients, extending our study to centenarians.

evident cancer or renal insufficiency), although many had decreased auditory and visual acuity as observed in other studies on healthy centenarians [15].

Total DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using standard methods. The analysis of the rs3851179 was performed using High Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) and the three genotypes were identified through sequencing (310 ABI PRISM Genetic Ana- lyzer, Applied Biosystem).

e4 The ApoE 4 allele was significantly associated with AD ( p < 0.00001; OR 3.74; 95% CI: 2.57–5.45) (Table 1).

The distribution of the rs3851179 genotypes and allele frequencies in the centenarian group shows a sta- tistically significant difference compared to the group of healthy subjects: OR 1.92 for the AA genotype (95% CI:1.00–3.67,p = 0.033)and1.44fortheAallele(95% CI: 1.04–1.98, p = 0.021) (Table 2). Comparing the LOAD group to the controls our data was not demon- strated to be statistically significant, the OR being 0.93 (95% CI: 0.59–1.47) for the AA genotype versus GG, and 0.98, 95% CI: 0.79–1.22, for the A allele (Table 2). Our data is in accordance with previous data ranging from OR 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76–0.88) [2], to 0.98 (95% CI: 0.69–1.40) [8].

Moreover,wedeterminedtheAPOEgenotypesinall the studied subjects using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the restriction fragment length polymor- phism (RFLP) method [16].

Moreover, the frequency (38.3%) of the minor allele in our control group is in agreement with the Caucasian control studied, ranging from 34% to 40% [2, 4, 6, 7].

After stratification for gender, the statistically sig- nificant value of the distribution of the A allele was confirmed among centenarian females: OR was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.00-.14, p = 0.042), while no differences

negative finding for the limited number of men (24 out of 105) in the centenarians.

We have analyzed for the first time PICALM on cen- tenarians and here provide evidence of its implication in the genetic architecture of longevity. It could there- fore be hypothesized that PICALM, possibly involved  in amyloid- clearance from the brain, could have a functional role in healthy aging.

The sample size analysis demonstrated a power of 95.5% in the LOAD group versus controls, with an OR = 0.5 being the allele associated with a reduced risk in developing LOAD.

Additionally, our sample of 105 centenarians was evaluated as having an 87.1% power to detect an OR of 2.0 at a 5% significance rate.

We analyzed the distribution of genotypes and alle- les of the PICALM SNP (rs3851179) in Italian LOAD patients and, as expected, we observed a decreased fre- quency of the A allele and AA genotype in AD cases compared to controls, although it was not statistically significant.

REFERENCES

The lack of statistically significant results in our data is probably due to the small size of the LOAD and control groups analyzed (708 subjects) compared to previous GWA and case control studies (over 70,000 subjects). Notably, based on the published data, the required sample needed to reach a statistical signi- ficance should be around 1370 cases and controls, with an OR = 0.8, confirming the inability with smaller groups to reach the statistical significance of the previ- ous GWA studies. However, part of our LOAD samples have been included in the first European GWA Study [3], for the analyses of rs541458 in the PICALM gene, indicating that our cases are a valid representative pathological group. Our data is nevertheless an impor- tant contribution to longevity implicating for the first time ultracentenarians (>54%), and not only oldest old
