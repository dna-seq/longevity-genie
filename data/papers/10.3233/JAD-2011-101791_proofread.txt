Abstract: 
A common polymorphism (rs3851179) in the PICALM (phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein) gene has been recently associated with reduced risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of the PICALM polymorphism in 813 Italian subjects, including LOAD patients and centenarians. The segregation of the PICALM rs3851179 showed no statistically significant difference between LOAD cases and controls. The implication of a genetic variant at PICALM is confirmed for the first time in centenarians, thus suggesting a possible role in longevity.

Introduction:
For almost twenty years, numerous molecular genetic studies in patients with the familial form of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) have revealed more than 220 pathogenetic mutations in the three candidate genes (APP, PS1, PS2) contributing to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1]. Despite numerous years of research, only one common genetic variant 4 (the 4 allele) in the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been considered a risk factor for the disease. It has become clear that the majority of common genetic variants contribute only slightly to an increased risk for the disease, but in combination, they have an important impact on disease predisposition. Recently, three large Genome-wide association (GWA) studies, including more than 48,000 subjects, tested hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and verified strong evidence of five new susceptibility loci for AD, CLU (clusterin, chr 8), PICALM (phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein, chr 11), CR1 (complement component [3b/4b] receptor 1, Chr 1), BIN1 (bridging integrator 1, chr 2) and EXOC3L2 (exocyst complex component 3-like 2, chr 19) [24]. Several large case-control studies have recently confirmed the role of PICALM in more than 23,000 subjects [58].

Methods:
All subjects were enrolled at the Neurology Unit of the Department of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences of the University of Florence and Department of Neuroscience, Neurological Clinic, of the University of Pisa. The studied group consisted of 813 Italian subjects: 349 sporadic LOAD patients, 359 sex-and age-matched healthy individuals as a control group and 105 centenarians (54.3% aged >100 years). Presence of a family history of dementia (at least two first-degree relatives in two generations) was considered an exclusion criterion. All controls were carefully assessed using a rigorous clinical history evaluation and a general/neurological examination in order to exclude the presence of any neurological disorder. They were interviewed to exclude the presence of relatives with exceptional longevity (>100 years) in past generations.

Total DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using standard methods. The analysis of the rs3851179 was performed using High-Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA), and the three genotypes were identified through sequencing (310 ABI PRISM Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystem). Moreover, we determined the APOE genotypes in all the studied subjects using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method.

Results:
The ApoE 4 allele was significantly associated with AD (p < 0.00001; OR 3.74; 95% CI: 2.57-5.45). The distribution of the rs3851179 genotypes and allele frequencies in the centenarian group shows a statistically significant difference compared to the group of healthy subjects: OR 1.92 for the AA genotype (95% CI:1.00-3.67, p = 0.033) and 6, 7]. After stratification by gender, the statistically significant value of the distribution of the A allele was confirmed among centenarian females: OR was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.00-2.14, p = 0.042), while no differences in genotype distributions of rs3851179 were observed in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all the studied groups.

I. Piaceri et al. / Implication of a Genetic Variant at PICALM in Alzheimer's Disease Patients and Centenarians were shown in LOAD (Table 2). After stratification, no differences were observed among all studied subjects with the presence/absence of APOE4 allele (data not shown). This is a negative finding for the limited number of men (24 out of 105) in the centenarians. We have analyzed PICALM on centenarians for the first time and provide evidence of its implication in the genetic architecture of longevity. It could, therefore, be hypothesized that PICALM, possibly involved in amyloid clearance from the brain, could have a functional roleJin LW, Johnson Karlawish J, Karydas A, Kaye JA, Kim R, Koo EH, NW, Lah JJ, Levey AI, Lieberman A, Lopez OL, Mack AC, Mesulam M, Miller JW, Miller BL, Miller CA, Parisi DP, Peskind E, Petersen RC, Poon W, Quinn JF, M Reisberg B, Ringman JM, Roberson ED, Rosenberg Sano M, Schneider JA, Schneider LS, Seeley W ML, Smith CD, Spina S, Stern RA, Tanzi RE JQ Troncoso JC, Van Deerlin VM,Vinters HV JP Weintraub S,Welsh-Bohmer KA,Woltjer RL and SG () Meta-analysis confirms CR CLU and APOE genotypes as Alzheimer's disease risk loci and reveals interactions.
