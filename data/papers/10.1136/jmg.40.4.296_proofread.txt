Long-term tissue damage can result from chronic inflammation, which has been linked to increased mortality risk in older individuals. Additionally, systemic chronic inflammation can cause organ-specific illnesses when interacting with an organism's genetic makeup. For instance, inflammatory processes play a pathogenetic role in age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis. These diseases are initiated or worsened by systemic inflammation, indicating the critical importance of unregulated systemic inflammation in shortening human survival. Proinflammatory cytokines are believed to contribute to age-related diseases, and genetic variations within their promoter regions have been shown to influence susceptibility to these diseases by increasing gene transcription and cytokine production.

In this study, we evaluated the association between longevity and alleles of IL-10 and TNF-a, which have opposite functions in inflammatory reactions. IL-10 primarily acts as an anti-inflammatory factor while TNF-a acts predominantly as a proinflammatory factor. We found that the number of male centenarians homozygous for the G genotype associated with high IL-10 production was significantly higher than that of younger controls. There were no significant differences between women and control subjects. The genotypic frequencies of TNF-a promoter SNPs G and A associated with low and high TNF-a production were not significantly different between centenarians and controls. However, there was a significant increase of the anti-inflammatory genotype (IL-10 GG/TNF-a GG) in centenarian men compared to controls.

Inflammatory markers predict disability and mortality in elderly cohorts, and a persistent inflammatory state has been proposed to be involved in the causal pathway of certain age-related chronic conditions. Thus, it is intriguing that the possession of an anti-inflammatory genotype is significantly increased in male centenarians. Conversely, genetic variations determining increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines or decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to be associated with successful ageing, suggesting a role for the control of the inflammatory state in the attainment of longevity.

Recently, the distribution of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been shown to be different in centenarians than in younger people. For instance, the +874T allele involved in high production of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-g was found less frequently in centenarian women than in control women. Also, the proportion of subjects homozygous for the G allele at the 174 IL-6 locus characterized by high serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly decreased in centenarian men. Conversely, the presence of the -1082 GG genotype associated with high production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased in centenarian men compared to younger male subjects.

In this study, we investigated the frequency of the -1082G fi A IL-10 promoter SNP in a larger cohort of 72 centenarian men and its interaction with -308A fi G TNF-a SNP. We found that the IL-10 gene SNP -1082G fi A had a significant influence on longevity in men, both separately and in association with TNF-a gene SNP 3082Afi G. This result is remarkable considering that centenarian men are relatively rare compared to centenarian women. 

IL-10 and TNF-a are cytokines with complex and predominantly opposing roles in inflammatory responses. The principal routine function of IL-10 is to limit and ultimately terminate inflammatory responses, whereas TNF-a determines strength, effectiveness, and duration of local and systemic inflammatory reactions. The stimulation of human blood samples with bacterial lipopolysaccharide showed large interperson variations of IL-10 and TNF-a.

Overall, our findings suggest that genetic variations affecting cytokine production play a crucial role in the attainment of longevity. The control of the inflammatory state may be critical in aging successfully.corrections and improvements:

TNF-α production, suggesting a genetic component of approximately 75% and 60%, respectively.18 Interpersonal differences in the regulation of IL-10 and TNF-α production may be critical with respect to the final outcome of an inflammatory response, that is within physiological limits or pathological ones.18 Several polymorphisms located close to or within the IL-10 and TNF-α genes have been shown to be associated with transcription levels. The best-documented of these polymorphisms are the IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms -1082 G to A, 716,1923 and a G to A transition at position 308 in the promoter region of TNF-α.11, 13, 24, 25 In the presence of allele -1082A, stimulation of lymphocytes with concanavalin A resulted in lower IL-10 production than in allele -1082A negative cells.14, 21 Also, the effects of this allelic promoter region difference (relative to the transcription start site) on IL-10 gene activation have been confirmed in reporter gene assays.20 Concerning TNF-α, there are also data relating the rare -308A allele to a higher transcriptional activity than the common -308G allele,11, 13, 24, 25 although a lack of such an association has also been reported in non-white populations depending on the HLA ancestral haplotype carrying this SNP.12, 24 However, the functional relevance of these SNPs has been shown by their involvement in determining susceptibility to immune-inflammatory diseases (for IL-10 -1082G to A14, 20, 26-35 for TNF-α11,13,24,25,36-42). Genotypic and allelic frequencies were evaluated by gene count. The data were tested for the goodness of fit between the observed and expected genotype values (χ2 test) and their fit to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. χ2 tests (3x2 tables or 2x2 tables) were performed to calculate significantly different genotype or allele distributions between centenarians and controls.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the frequency of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes for 1082 G to A IL-10 SNP and for 308 G to A TNF-α in our sample of Italian centenarian men and sex-matched controls. The number of centenarians homozygous for the 1082G genotype was significantly increased in this cohort of centenarian men in comparison with younger control subjects (p=0.019). Accordingly, the SNP distribution between centenarians and controls was significantly different, with the 1082G allele increased in centenarians (0.69 vs. 0.56, p=0.01 by χ2 test). As already reported,7 no significant differences were observed in women between centenarians and controls (1082G, 0.62 vs. 0.59, p=NS by χ2 test). The genotypic frequencies of the TNF-α promoter SNP of centenarian and control men were not statistically different.

The isolated assessment of cytokine genotypes may be misleading without considering other interacting cytokines. In vivo control of TNF-α synthesis is complex and downregulated by anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10.12, 13 The potential biological importance of this finding was highlighted by a recent study showing a strong association between the combined low IL-10/high TNF-α genotype and early graft rejection in heart transplant recipients.14 OtherLimitations: Since this study was conducted with Italian centenarians, it is unclear whether the findings can be extended to other ethnic populations. Notably, in a Finnish population, IL-10 and TNF-a promoter allele and haplotype frequencies were not different between nonagenarians and controls.47 Moreover, no significant association between cytokine polymorphisms and longevity has been found in the Sardinian population.48 Overall, these findings suggest that cytokine/longevity associations might have a population-specific component, affected by the population-specific gene pool as well as by gene-environment interaction. Another limitation of the study was the lack of data regarding plasma levels of IL-10 and TNF-a. However, the functional relevance of the studied polymorphisms is well known (see above). Besides, some may argue that a Bonferroni-type adjustment should be performed to correct for testing multiple polymorphisms. If this correction is carried out, none of the polymorphisms would have been significantly associated. However, this correction is too stringent and has the potential to ignore important observations49 and, in any case, for studies on centenarians, increasing the number of cases is very challenging. Nonetheless, inflammatory markers predict disability and mortality in elderly cohorts, and a persistent inflammatory state has been proposed to be involved in the causal pathway of certain age-related chronic conditions.1 3 50 Therefore, it is intriguing that possession of an anti-inflammatory genotype is significantly increased in male centenarians.
