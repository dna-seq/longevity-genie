Abstract

are important for regulation body metabolism and immune response. Many studies have shown that variants in genes play a role in age-associated diseases. In this study, we investigated the contribution of rs266729 rs2241766 (þ45T/G), and rs1501299 (þ276 G/T) SNPs of adiponectin gene (ADIPQO) and rs7799039 SNP of leptin (LEP) gene to human longevity phenotype in Jordanian population. Polymorphisms were in 110 randomly selected elderly subjects (485 years old) with mean age of 90.2 years, and 120 young control (range from 20 to 50 years) with mean age of 32.0 years. No significant differences were detected in the genotype allele frequencies of examined gene variants between the two groups (p 40.05). However, when gender was considered, and alleles frequencies of rs1501299 SNP in ADIPOQ gene and rs7799039 in LEP gene were significantly with longevity in men (p 50.02) but not in women (p4 0.05). Thus, ADIPOQ and LEP genes polymorphisms play a gender-specific role in the pathway to men’s longevity.

Introduction

Leptin, on the other hand, is increased significantly in individuals suffering from obesity, diabetes melli- tus, hypertension or metabolic syndrome [11]. A common promoter polymorphic site rs7799039 SNP in the leptin (LEP) gene is associated with transcrip- tional activity, leading to reduced circulating leptin concentrations in subjects with AA genotype [11,12]. This polymorphism is also associated with multiple age-related diseases in several populations such as breast cancer among Tunisians [13], and non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer among Portu- guese [14,15].

Adiponectin and leptin are adipokines secreted from white adipose tissue and function in a hormone-like manner to regulate body metabolism and immune responses [1]. Adiponectin activates multiple signal- ling pathways, which mediate its anti-diabetic, anti- atherogenic and anti-inflammatory functions, thus, adiponectin has a protective role against age-related diseases [2,3]. Low level of adiponectin has been implicated in several late-onset disease states such as insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes [4], cardiovas- cular disease [5], hypertension [6] and dyslipidemia [7]. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ gene (adipocyte-, C1Q and collagen domain containing) that code for adiponectin, have been shown to affect either levels or activity of adiponectin and have been associated with age-related diseases. For example, the promoter rs266729 SNP lowers the circulating levels of adiponectin and has strong association with metabolic syndrome among Spanish and French populations [8]. Furthermore, rs2241766 and rs1501299 SNPs in ADIPOQ gene,

Since adiponectin and leptin play an important role in the body homeostasis and susceptibility to age- related diseases, allelic variants that change the levels and/or activity of adiponectin and leptin might be involved in the pathway of human longevity [16]. Indeed, two allelic variants in ADIPOQ gene, rs17300539 (711391G/A) and þ2019A/7, are associated with longevity in Ashkenazi Jewish popula- tion [17]. In the current study, the contribution of

rs266729, rs2241766, and rs1501299 SNPs in ADI- POQ gene and rs7799039 SNP in LEP gene to longevity phenotype were investigated in Jordanian population. Results showed that rs1501299 SNP in ADIPOQ gene and rs7799039 SNP in promoter region of LEP gene play a gender-specific role in human longevity.

the extracted DNA was measured using Smart- SpectTM3000 (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK). Three polymorphic sites of ADIPOQ were genotyped according to Li et al. [21] using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Table I summarises the primers sequence, annealing temperature and restriction enzymes (Fermentas. GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Ger- many) that were used. For each polymorphic site; 20 ml reaction mixtures containing 5 ng of template DNA, 0.75 unit GoTaq polymerase (Promega), and a final concentration of 200 mM of each deoxynu- cleotide and 1X reaction buffer, 1 mM of each forward and reverse primers. PCR products were detected using electrophoresis on 3% agarose, confirming the presence of a product. The restriction enzyme digestion was carried out in 20 ml containing 3 units of enzyme and 10 ml of PCR product and incubated at optimum temperature (see Table I) for 4 h. The LEP rs7799039 SNP was also analysed using PCR-RFLP as described by Stunff et al. [11]. PCR primers, annealing temperature and restriction enzymes are shown in Table I.

Material and methods

A sample of 110 unrelated elderly subjects (485 years, mean age 90.2 years) was recruited from different parts of Jordan. Additionally, 120 unrelated control subjects (range from 20 to 50 years, mean age 32.0) were matched to long-lived individuals for geographical origin. Male to female ratio was 1.6:1 in the elderly group and 1.4:1 in the control group (p 4 0.05). Subjects with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or cognitive impairments were excluded from the study. The experimental design was similar to longevity studies reviewed by Glatt et al. [18]. The age criterion was chosen based on the mortality rate in the Jordanian population which remains approxi- mately constant from childhood until late 40s and then starts inclining exponentially at 50 years of age getting maximum level in the late 70s [19]. Accord- ing to the 2007 census, the total population of Jordan was 5.7 million, percentage of individuals of 65 years of age or older was 4.1%, and life expectancy at birth in the total population was 73 years [20]. Therefore, reaching above 85 year-old is a rarity in Jordan and oldest old people are considered exceptional individ- uals in Jordan. To verify age, an official identification document was required from all participants in the study. Written informed consents were obtained from all participants in accordance with the require- ments of the Institutional Review Board of Jordan University of Science and Technology.

The genotype distributions of the examined polymorphisms were analysed in agreement with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Statistical evaluation of results was done by comparing allele, genotype and predicted phenotype distributions using the w2 test. If n 5 5, exact Fisher statistic was used. The SPSS 15.0 statistical software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical evaluations. Because several significant associations were ob- served among the 24 associations examined in the study, which exceeds the number that might be observed by chance (one significant association/ 24 tests), a p-values of 5 0.05 was considered significant without adjustments for multiple com- parisons.

Blood samples (1–3 ml) in ethylenediaminetetra- acetic acid (EDTA) tubes were obtained from all subjects. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was ex- tracted from all samples using Wizard DNA Extrac- tion Kit (Promega, Madison, USA) according to manufacturer instructions. DNA samples were stored at 7208C until used. The concentration of

Several studies indicated that gender was a main variable in the genetics of longevity and suggested that men and women might follow different pathways to reach longevity [22–25]. Therefore, the effect of ADIPOQ and LEP genes SNPs on longevity were re- evaluated separately in each gender. Genotype frequency and allele frequency for rs1501299 ADIPOQ SNP and rs7799039 LEP gene promoter SNP were significantly different between the elderly and the young groups in men (genotype frequencies: p ¼ 0.011 for rs1501299 SNP and p ¼ 0.021 for rs7799039 SNP; alleles frequencies: p ¼ 0.011 for rs1501299 SNP and p ¼ 0.011 for rs7799039 SNP, Table III) but not in women (p ¼ 0.788 for rs1501299 SNP and p ¼ 0.962 for rs7799039 SNP, alleles frequencies: p ¼ 0.621 for rs1501299 SNP and p ¼ 0.990 for rs7799039 SNP, Table IV).

other hand, no significant difference was detected between the elderly and young control groups when gender was considered in the rs2241766 and rs266729 SNPs of ADIPOQ gene (for both SNPs, men: p 4 0.05, Table III, and women: p 4 0.05, Table IV).

variations in hormonal signalling pathways, body metabolism, immunity response, oxidative damage tolerance might account for such differences [38].

Results of this study showed absence of association between rs2241766 and rs266729 SNPs of ADIPOQ gene and longevity in both genders. Previous studies are variable concerning the association of rs2241766 or rs266729 SNP in ADIPOQ gene with age- associated diseases. Positive association of rs2241766 SNP has been reported in Korean population with coronary artery disease [39], and in Iranian population with type-2 diabetes [40]. In contrast, negative association with disease has been reported in Polish population with type-2 dia- betes, and Italian population with coronary artery diseases [31,32]. For – rs266729 SNP, positive association was reported in Spanish subjects with metabolic syndrome [8], while no association was detected between rs266729 SNP and survival among Ashkenazi Jewish population [17]. Therefore, ADI- POQ polymorphisms/age-related diseases associa- tions might have a population specific component. In addition, it is possible that Jordanians have different polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene that might buffer out or modulate the effect of the rs2241766 and rs266729 SNPs.

Discussion

Adiponectin and leptin are adipocyte-derived protein hormones that play a pivotal role in regulation of immune response and body metabolism [1]. Changes in plasma level/activity of adiponectin and leptin in adipocytes contribute to several age- associated diseases in human such as metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, hypertension, type-2 diabetes and cancer [4–7,13,16,26,27].

Recently, a Japanese study showed that plasma adiponectin levels were significantly higher in elderly subjects from a longevity district compared to subjects from a non-longevity district [28] suggesting a possible role of adipokines in the pathway to human longevity. In this study, the possible association of three polymorphisms in ADIPOQ gene and one polymorphism in LEP gene with longevity phenotype was examined. Results showed that rs1501299 ADIPOQ SNP and rs7799039 LEP gene promoter SNP are associated with longevity in men but not in women. Previous studies have shown that the rs1501299 SNP is associated with low serum adiponectin [29,30], and increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease [26,30,31] and type-2 dia- betes [32]. Similarly, the rs7799039 LEP SNP is associated with transcriptional activity. It is located proximal to a binding site for the Sp1 transcription factor in the promoter region, and high expression occurs in the presence of CC genotype [11,12,33]. The clinical significance of this polymorphism has been demonstrated by its association with age-related diseases including cancer [13–15]. The finding that rs1501299 ADIPOQ and rs7799039 leptin SNPs play a role in human longevity provides more evidence of the clinical importance of these SNPs in age-related diseases.

Jordan is a small country located in Southwest Asia. The population is predominantly Arab (98%) [20] originally from Jordan and Palestine with approximately equal percentages. Since Jordanian and Palestinian share common ancestry, stratification due to migration of Palestinians to Jordan in 1948 is not expected to affect the results. In addition, the subjects (elderly and young) were recruited from different parts of Jordan without taking into con- sideration their origin and therefore, the sample is homogeneous.

data regarding plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin, however, the functional relevance of the studied polymorphisms is well documented [11,12,29,30,33]. In addition, several other poly- morphisms in the examined genes (rs17300539 and þ2019A/7) were not investigated in this study. Examining plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin in subjects in addition to genotyping of other SNPs in examined loci and their relation with longevity in Jordanian population will be a matter of future studies.

variable in the genetics of longevity in different populations. For instance, Tyrosine Hydroxylase gene, TNF-a, and mtDNA haplogroup are asso- ciated with longevity in men [22,34,35] while haemochromatosis, IL2 and interferon-gamma gene polymorphisms are associated with longevity in women [25,36,37]. Recently, Atzmon et al. [17] demonstrated that two SNPs, rs17300539 and þ2019A/7 in ADIPOQ gene are associated with longevity in men of the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The finding that rs1501299 ADIPOQ SNP and rs7799039 LEP gene promoter SNP are associated with men’s longevity but not in women in Jordanian population supports the hypothesis of gender differ- ences in the pathway to human longevity. Gender

In conclusion, results of this study indicate that rs1501299 ADIPOQ SNP and rs7799039 LEP gene promoter SNP play a gender-specific role in human longevity.
